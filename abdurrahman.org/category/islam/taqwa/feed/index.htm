										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن تَتَّقُوا اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! If you obey and fear Allaah, He will grant you <em>Furqan</em>, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.</strong></span> (Al-Anfal 8:29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, As-Suddi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and several others said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<em>Furqan</em>), means, <strong>`a way out&#8217;</strong>;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid added, <strong>&#8220;In this life and the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, Ibn `Abbas is reported to have said, `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>salvation</strong>&#8216; or &#8212; according to another narration &#8212; <strong>`aid&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Ishaq said that `<em>Furqan</em>&#8216; means `<strong>criterion between truth and falsehood</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This last explanation from Ibn Ishaq is more general than the rest that we mentioned, and it also includes the other meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Certainly, those who have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah by obeying what He ordained and abstaining from what he forbade, will be guided to differentiate between the truth and the falsehood. This will be a triumph, safety and a way out for them from the affairs of this life, all the while acquiring happiness in the Hereafter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will also gain forgiveness, thus having their sins erased, and pardon, thus having their sins covered from other people, as well as, being directed to a way to gain Allah&#8217;s tremendous rewards,</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَآمِنُوا بِرَسُولِهِ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُورًا تَمْشُونَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Have <em>Taqwa</em> of Allah, and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(straight)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. And He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span> </strong>(57:28)</p>

<p>On the authority of Abu Abbas Abdullah bin Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify text_details">One day I was behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [riding on the same mount] and he said, <strong>“O young man, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: </strong></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah and Allah will protect you. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If you ask, then ask Allah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah [alone]. </strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allah had already prescribed against you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.”</strong></span></p>



<p class="text_details"><span style="line-height:1.5;">It was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a good and sound hadeeth.</span></p>



<p class="text_details">Another narration, other than that of Tirmidhi, reads:</p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. </strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Recognize and acknowledge Allah in times of ease and prosperity, and He will remember you in times of adversity.</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and hardship with ease.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah<em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters – which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you</strong></span>.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning,<em>Shirk, Bida’</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah –</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and being aware of Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Advising the one who says &#8220;Taqwa is here&#8221; and he continues to Sin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A Doubt and its Rebuttle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">What lead to this question is that nowadays there is a group of people when they are called to worship Allaah they say: “Allaah is the Rabb of the hearts.” We would like also that you comment on this response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> We say that Allaah is indeed the Rabb of the hearts as well as the tongues. He is not the Rabb of the hearts only; and if the hearts become good then the limbs become good, because the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.</span> [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth renders the futile and false the claim by some, who when you advise him in regard to certain things with which he disobeys Allaah, he says: “at-Taqwaa [30] is right here,” and he points towards his chest.[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His is a word of truth intended to imply something futile. In fact a word may be true in its general sense, but the speaker intends to imply by it a futile meaning. Indeed think of the Saying of Allaah, The Most High, concerning the Mushriks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Mushriks will say: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything [against His Will]!</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they said: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk,” and they were truthful in that which they said. Because if Allaah had willed, they would have not committed Shirk. They, however, did not intend the truth by using this word. Rather, they wanted to justify their staying on their Shirk and the lifting of punishment from upon them. This is why Allaah, The Most High, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise belied those who were before them, [they argued falsely with Allaah’s Messengers], till they tasted of Our Wrath.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, of no avail to them was the use of al-Qadar [32] [Allaah’s Pre-decree] as a plea when they intended it to be a justification for continuing on their Shirk, and an excuse for lifting the blame and punishment from upon themselves. [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actual fact, however, is exactly as they have put it: “If Allaah had not willed, they would not have committed Shirk,” as Allaah, The Most High, said to His Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been inspired to you [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] from your Rabb, Laa Ilaaha Illaa Huwa [none has the right to be worshipped but He] and turn aside from the Mushriks. Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 106-107].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is, however, a difference between the two cases. In the latter case, Allaah Said to His Prophet (what means): “Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk,” in order to clarify that their Shirk occurs by His Will, and that He, The One free of all imperfections, The Most High, has a Wisdom as to the committing of Shirk by them; and in order to comfort His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that this action of theirs (Shirk) takes place by His, The Exalted and Most High’s, Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the important thing is that the person who says when you give him advice: “at-Taqwaa is here [i.e. in his heart],” has said a true word indeed. However, he intended by it something futile and false, because the one who said: “at- Taqwaa is here&#8230;” is the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, the same one who also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good&#8230;”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If there is Taqwaa in the heart, then it is imperative that there is Taqwaa in the limbs, and the outward actions are a sign of the inward actions of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] An agreed upon hadeeth. See Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol.1, no. 49.<br />
[30] The true meaning of at-Taqwaa is fearing Allaah and hoping for His Mercy by executing His Commands and staying away from all that He has forbidden.<br />
[31] The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in the authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim said: <span style="color:#008000;">“A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him. The Taqwaa is here [and while saying so] he pointed towards his chest thrice.”</span> See Saheeh Muslim, vol. 4, no.6219.<br />
[32] Al-Qadar: Allaah’s Pre-ordainment of the creation in accordance with His Foreknowledge, and in accordance with His Wisdom.<br />
[33] In his book Sharh al-Usool ath-Thalaathah, Shaykh Muhammd Bin ‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “If there had been any excuse for them in al-Qadar then Allaah would not have sent down His Punishment upon them.”</span> See Sharh al-Usool ath-Thalaathah [English Translation by brother Daawood Burbank], p.186, Daar al- Hidaayah Publishing, Birmingham, U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 50<br />
Fear (of Allah)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And fear none but Me&#8221;.</b></span><b> (2:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) the Grip (punishment) of your Rubb is severe&#8221;.</b></span><b> (85:12)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Such is the Seizure of your Rubb when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful, (and) severe. Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens and the earth) will be present. And We delay it only for a term (already) fixed. On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His (Allah&#8217;s) Leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed. As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, sighing in a high and low tone&#8221;.</b></span><b> (11:102-106)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And Allah warns you against Himself (His punishment)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:30)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;That Day shall a man flee from his brother. And from his mother and his father. And from his wife and his children. Every man that Day will have enough to make him careless of others&#8221;.</b></span><b> (80:34-37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! Fear your Rubb and be dutiful to Him! Verily, the earthquake of the Hour (of Resurrection) is a terrible thing. The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and every pregnant one will drop her load, and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but severe will be the Torment of Allah&#8221;.</b></span><b> (22:1,2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;But for him who fears the standing before his Rubb, there will be two Gardens (i.e., in Jannah)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (55:46)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And some of them draw near to others, questioning. Saying: `Aforetime, we were afraid (of the punishment of Allah) in the midst of our families. So Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone and none else) before. Verily, He is Al-Barr (the Most Subtle, Kind, Courteous, and Generous), the Most Merciful.&#8221;.</b></span><b> (52:25-28)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>396.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), the truthful and the receiver of the truth informed us, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The creation of you (humans) is gathered in the form of semen in the womb of your mother for forty days, then it becomes a clinging thing in similar (period), then it becomes a lump of flesh like that, then Allah sends an angel who breathes the life into it; and (the angel) is commanded to record four things about it: Its provision, its term of life (in this world), its conduct; and whether it will be happy or miserable. By the One besides Whom there is no true god! Verily, one of you would perform the actions of the dwellers of Jannah until there is only one cubit  between him and it (Jannah), when what is foreordained would come to pass and he would perform the actions of the inmates of Hell until he enter it. And one of you would perform the actions of the inmates of Hell, until there is only one cubit between him and Hell. Then he would perform the acts of the dwellers of Jannah until he would enter it.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>397.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Hell will be brought on that Day (the Day of Resurrection) with seventy bridles; and with every bridle will be seventy thousand angels, pulling it&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>398.</b> Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The least tortured man on the Day of Resurrection is one underneath whose feet will be placed two live coal, and his brain will be boiling, and he would think that he is the most tortured, while he is the least tortured&#8221;,</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>399.</b> Samurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Prophet of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Among the people of Hell are there those who will be emersed in fire to their ankels, some to their knees, some to their waists, and some to their throats&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>400.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Mankind will stand before Allah, the Rubb of the worlds (on the Day of Resurrection), some of them will stand submerged in perspiration up to half of their ears&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>401</b>. Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delivered a Khutbah to us the like of which I had never heard from him before. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much&#8221;</span>. Thereupon those present covered their faces and began sobbing.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard of something about his Companions upon which he addressed them and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jannah and (Hell) Fire were shown to me and I have never seen the like of this day in good and in evil. If you were to know what I know, you would laugh little and weep much&#8221;</span>. His Companions experienced such suffering on that day that had no equal. They covered their faces and began to weep.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>402.</b> Al-Miqdad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">On the Day of Resurrection, the sun will come so close to people that there would be left only a distance of one Meel&#8221;</span>. Sulaim bin `Amir said: By Allah, I do not know whether he meant by &#8220;Meel&#8221;, the mile of the distance measure or the stick used for applying antimony powder to the eye. (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is, however, reported to have said:)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The people then will be submerged in perspiration according to their deeds, some up to their ankles, some up to their knees, some up to the waist and some will have the bridle of perspiration (reaching their mouth and nose)</span> and, while saying this Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) pointed to his mouth with his hand&#8221;.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>403.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The people will perspire on the Day of Resurrection and their perspiration will be seventy cubits down in the earth and it will reach up to their ears (they will be bridled with it)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>404.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when we heard a bang. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you know what this (sound) is?</span>&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That is a stone which was thrown into Hell seventy years before and it has just reached its bottom&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>405.</b> `Adi bin Hatim (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Everyone of you will speak to his Rubb without an interpreter between them. He will look to his right side and will see only the deeds he had previously done; he will look to his left and will see only the deeds he had previously done, and he will look in front of him and will see nothing but Fire (of Hell) before his face. So protect yourselves from Fire (of Hell), even by giving half a date-fruit (in charity)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>406.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I see what you do not see and I hear what you do not hear; heaven has squeaked, and it has right to do so. By Him, in Whose Hand my soul is, there is not a space of four fingers in which there is not an angel who is prostrating his forehead before Allah, the Exalted. By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little, weep much, and you would not enjoy women in beds, but would go out to the open space beseeching Allah&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>407.</b> Abu Barzah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Man&#8217;s feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection before he is asked about his life, how did he consume it, his knowledge, what did he do with it, his wealth, how did he earn it and how did he dispose of it, and about his body, how did he wear it out.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>408.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) recited,<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;That Day it (the earth) will reveal its news (about all that happened over it of good or evil).&#8221;</span> (99:4). Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) inquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you know what its news are?</span>&#8221; He was told: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Its news is that it shall bear witness against every slave man and woman they did on its back. It will say: `You did this and this on such and such day.&#8217; Those will be its news.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>409.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How can I feel at ease when the Angel of the Trumpet, (Israfil) has put his lips to the Trumpet and is waiting for the order to blow it&#8221;.</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) perceived as if this had shocked his Companions, so he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told them to seek comfort through reciting:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Hasbunallah wa ni`mal-Wakil</span> [Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of  affairs (for us)]&#8221;.<br />

Be on your guard that the commodity of Allah is precious. Verily the commodity of Allah is Jannah&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will the men and the women be together on that Day; looking at one another?&#8221; Upon this Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Aishah, the matter will be too serious for them to look at one another&#8221;.</span><br />

Chapter 6<br />
Piety</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:102)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So, keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (64:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second Verse explains the meaning of the first one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:70)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (65:2,3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;If you obey and fear Allah, He will grant you Furqan [(a criterion to judge between right and wrong), or   (Makhraj, i.e., a way for you to get out from every difficulty)], and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty&#8221;.</b></span><b> (8:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>69.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: It was asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Who is the most honourable amongst mankind?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The most honourable of them is one who is the most pious of them</span>.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We are not asking about this&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then, the most honourable of men was Yusuf  (Joseph), the Prophet of Allah, the son of  Allah&#8217;s Prophet, who was the son of  the Prophet of Allah, who was the son of the Khalil of Allah (i.e., Ibrahim (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))</span><span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span> They said, &#8220;We are not asking you about this.&#8221; He enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Are you then asking me about the classes of the Arabs? The best of them in the Pre-Islamic Period of  Ignorance are the best of them in Islam, provided they comprehend the religious knowledge&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>70.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The life of the world is sweet and green. Allah makes you generations succeeding one another so that He may try you in respect of your actions. So beware of the beguilements of the world and those of women. The first trial of Banu Israel was through women&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>71.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahumma inni as&#8217;alukal-huda wat-tuqa wal-`afafa wal-ghina (O Allah! I ask You for guidance, piety, chastity and self-sufficiency)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>72.</b> `Adi bin Hatim At-Ta&#8217;i (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who has taken an oath (to do something) but found something else better than that (which brings him closer to Allah), then he should do that which is better in piety (and he should expiate for the breaking of oath)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>73.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) during the sermon of the Farewell Pilgrimage saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be mindful of your duty to Allah; perform your five daily Salat, observe Saum during the month (of Ramadan) , pay the Zakat on your properties and obey your leaders; (if you do so) you will enter the Jannah of your Rubb&#8221;.</span><br />

Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you (wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you &#8216;are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.</p>

Ghazwan delivered us a sermon and he praised Allah and lauded Him, then said: Now coming to the point, verily the world has been given the news of its end and that too quite early. Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa&#8217;d b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of it and so did Sa&#8217;d make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would come after us and see (how far they are from religion).</p>

Then Allah would sit in judgment upon the servant and would say: O, so and so, did I not honour you and make you the chief and provide you the spouse and subdue for you horses, camels, and afforded you an opportunity to rule over your subjects?

And he would say: No. And then He (Allah) would say: Well, I forget you today as you forgot Us. Then the third -one would be brought and He (Allah) would say to him as He said before. And he (the third person) would say: O, my Lord, I affirmed my faith in Thee and in Thy Book and in Thy Messenger and I observed prayer and fasts and gave charity, and he would speak in good terms like this as he would be able to do. And He (Allah) would say: Well, We will bring our witnesses to you. And the man would think in his mind who would bear witness upon him and then his mouth would be sealed and it would be said to his thighs, to his flesh and to his bones to speak and his thighs. flesh and bones would bear witness to his deeds and it would be done so that he should not be able to make any excuse for himself and he would be a hypocrite and Allah would be annoyed with him.</p>

Then the servant would say: I do not deem valid any witness against me but my own self, and He would say: Well, enough would he the witness of your self against you and that of the two angels who had been appointed to record your deeds. Then the seal would be set upon his mouth and it would be said to his hands and feet to speak and they would speak of his deeds.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) thus said: There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk&#8217;s) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don&#8217;t give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he &#8216;said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy&#8217;s) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="042.7149"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma&#8217;afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma&#8217;afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother&#8217;s bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu&#8217;I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma&#8217;afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. &#8216;Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it&#8217; is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don&#8217;t curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah&#8217;s Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word&#8221; faitab&#8217;d&#8221; and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma&#8217;il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin&#8217;s,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart&#8217;s content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father (&#8216;Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to &#8216;Azib: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he (&#8216;Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara&#8217; striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. &#8216;Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don&#8217;t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to &#8216;Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="title" style="font-weight:bold;color:#494949;text-align:justify;">The following are excerps from <em>‘Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge’</em> by Imaam Ibn al-Jawzi (Rahimahullaahu Ta’aala), in which he is advising his son:</p>
<div class="copy" style="color:#6e7173;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Observe, my son, the way you deal with the limits of Allaah and see how you can keep yourself within their bounds.<strong> Indeed, he who takes care of these limits is taken great care of, and he who doesn’t, is left to himself.</strong> I shall now mention some of my experience to you so that you may observe my striving and ask the Granter of success to bless me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, <strong>most of the blessings I have been given have not been earned by me but rather they are conferred as a result of the planning of The Gentle One alone.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I remember myself as a child: A highly motivated six-year old sitting in class with older boys. The intellect I had been given superseded of old men. <strong>I do not recall myself playing on the road with other kids or even laughing out loud. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was seven or so, I attended the gatherings in the Masjid. I would not sit in a circle of mere wordplay, but searching for a Hadeeth Scholar who would narrate about the Prophet’s (Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam) life. <strong>I would memorize everything he said, then go back home and write it down.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was blessed for being granted my teacher Abu al-Fadl ibn Nasir (Rahimahullaah) who would take me to different Scholars and let me hear the Musnad [of Imaam Ahmad] and other major works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>All this time I had no idea of why I was made to do these things.</strong> My teacher recorded all I had heard, and when I reached puberty he handed me this record. I accompanied him till his death, and through him I learned the science of Hadeeth and transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kids used to go down to Tigris River and play on the bridge, <strong>but when I was small I used to take a book and sit far from people by the shore studying Sacred Knowledge. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then I was inspired to abandon the vanities of this world so I began constant fasting and reduced my food intake to very little.</strong> I trained myself to be patient, embarking on a continuous pursuit in order to do so and staying up at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I didn’t feel satisfied with studying just one science so I read jurisprudence, sermon delivery and Hadeeth and followed those who practiced Zuhd. After that I studied linguistics. There was not a narrating Scholar or a preacher where I lived who I didn’t sit with and whenever such a person would arrive from elsewhere I would go to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I used to choose of virtuous deeds what suited me and if I had to choose between two things I usually chose the right of al-Haqq (Allaah). </strong>He has planned my life and cultivated me in a beautiful fashion, guiding me towards what is best for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has protected me from my enemies, the jealous, and those who might plot against me. He has made everything convenient for my studies of Sacred Knowledge and sent me books from unexpected places. He gave me good understanding, the ability to memorize and write quickly and a talent for authoring books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I lacked nothing of this world. As a matter of fact, things were quite the opposite as Allaah gave me more than enough. He put a great deal of acceptance of me into peoples’ hearts and made the impact of my words leave them not questioning the authenticity of what I had to say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Approximately 200 thimmis [i.e. people of the book who live in Muslim lands according to a truce contract] have become Muslim at my hands <strong>and over 100 000 sinners have repented in my gatherings.</strong> More than 20 000 men have announced their repentance from foolish ways during my exhortations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to go around Hadeeth gatherings of different Scholars and run till I was out of breath so no-one would precede me. <strong>I would start my day having nothing to eat and finish it having nothing to eat.</strong> Never did Allaah degrade me to take from another person, instead He provided for me in order to protect my honour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truth is, mentioning all my experience would take quite a while. And here I am now and you can see what I have achieved. <strong>I will tell you the whole story in one single sentence,</strong> and that is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">”<strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">Fear Allaah, and Allaah will teach you</span>.</strong>” [Surah al-Baqarah:282]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Note : The Book &#8220;<em style="font-weight:bold;color:#494949;">‘Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge’&#8221; </em> was published by Dar us Sunnah publishers</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement; (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying; (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author: Shaikh Abu Anas Hamad-ul-&#8216;Uthmaan<br />
Source: His book Nubadh Fee Aadaab it-Talab (pp.12-15)<br />
Al-Ibaanah Magazine &#8211; Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabî’ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Have taqwaa (fear) of Allaah and believe in His Messenger; and He will bestow upon you a double portion of His Mercy and He will provide you with a light by which you will walk.&#8221;</b>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who Believe! If you have taqwaa of Allaah, He will give to you a Furqaan (criterion to judge between right and wrong).&#8221;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AI-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.777H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, as-Suddee, &#8216;Ikrimah, ad-Dahhaak, Qataadah and Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan all said about Furqaan &#8220;that it means: a way out (from difficulty).&#8221; Mujaahid added: &#8220;A way out (from difficulty) both in this world and in the Hereafter.&#8221; In a narration from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas he said it means: salvation; and in another narration from him: being helped. Muhammad ibn Ishaaq said that it means: &#8220;a criterion to judge between truth and falsehood.&#8221; This explanation from Ibn Ishaaq is the most general of what has already preceeded and it is a necessary consequence of it. Since whoever has taqwaa of Allaah by obeying His command and abandoning what He has prohibited, will be given the ability to recognise truth from falsehood. This will be the cause for his salvation, his being helped; and the cause for his worldly affairs being made easier and his happiness on the Day of Judgement. It will also be the cause for his sins to be expiated by Allaah, and his being granted forgiveness and Allaah shielding him from the people. It will likewise be the cause of him being the recipient (if a great reward from Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: &#8216;O you who Believe! Have taqwaa (fear) of Allaah and believe in His Messenger; and He will bestow upon you a double portion of His Mercy and He will provide you with a light by which you will walk.'[4]&#8221;[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">lbn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; radiallaahu anhu &#8211; said: &#8220;Indeed I hold that a person forgets knowledge that he used to know because of sins that he commits.&#8221;[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wakee&#8217; (d.197H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;I seek help in memorization by abandoning sin and disobedience.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik (d.179H) said to ash-Shafi’ee when they first met: &#8220;Indeed I see that Allaah has placed a light upon your heart so do not extinguish it with the darkness of disobedience and sin.&#8221;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaaf&#8217;ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:&#8221;Whosoever loves that Allaah Should open up his heart for him and grant light to him, then let him abandon speech about that which does not concern him, and abandon sins and turn away from acts of disobedience. Then there will be between him and Allaah a hidden treasure of good actions. So if this is done, then Allaah will open up such knowledge for him, that will pre-occupy him. And indeed in death is the greatest pre-occupation.&#8221;[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul- Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d .728 H) said: &#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has made as a punishment for people&#8217;s sins, the absence of guidance and beneficial knowledge, as He says: &#8220;They say: Our hearts are wrapped-up (and we do not understand). Rather, Allaah has put a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief.&#8221;[10] And He said: &#8220;They say: Our hearts are wrapped-up (and we do not understand). Rather, Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief. &#8221; [11] And He said: &#8220;And we shall turn their hearts and their sight away from guidance, as they refused to believe therein for the first time.&#8221; [12] And Allaah says: &#8220;In their hearts is a disease, and Allaah increases their disease.&#8221; [13] And He says: &#8220;So when they turned away, AlIaah turned their hearts away.&#8221; [14]&#8221; [15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara&#8217; said, &#8220;During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to enter the house from the back upon assuming the Ihram. Thereafter, Allah revealed (the following Ayah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded the same Hadith from Al-Bara&#8217; but with the wording; &#8220;The Ansar used to enter their houses from the back when returning from a journey. Thereafter, this Ayah (2:189 above) was revealed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said, &#8220;When some people during the time of Jahiliyyah would leave home to travel, and then decide not to travel, they would not enter the house from its door. Rather, they would climb over the back wall. Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you enter the houses from the back,).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement:<br />
(&#8230;and have Taqwa of Allah that you may be successful.) Have Taqwa of Allah, means to do what He has commanded you and refrain from what He has forbidden for you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that you may be successful.) tomorrow when you stand before Him and He thus rewards you perfectly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Examples of <a title="Biography of Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbaad (hafidhahullah)" href="http://scholars-biographies.com/2013/08/15/biography-of-shaykh-abdul-muhsin-al-abbaad-hafidhahullah/" target="_blank">Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbaad</a>&#8216;s Piety:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh served as president of the Islamic University of Madeenah, he didn’t abuse his position and take it as an opportunity to oppress the workers and employees. Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree relates: “I went to the University at the time of ‘Asr when Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin served as its president. And there would be no one in the University except for him and me. So I said to him: ‘Why don’t you bring someone who will open the University for you before you come?’ He replied: ‘I will not make anybody work at this time because it is a time of rest.’ This was at the time of ‘Asr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One graduate from the University related that when the Shaikh was president there he would not like to stop the university car on the road to buy things for the house. Meaning: Since the car was just to take him to and from work, he would not like to abuse this by using it for personal reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion, when his term of presidency ended, his driver saw him standing on the street waiting, so he passed by him as usual and offered to take him home, but he replied: “I wouldn’t think of it. My term as president has ended and I called my son to come and get me.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Audio : <strong>Abu Muhammad al-Maghribee </strong><em>(hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of Selected Ahaadeeth from <strong>Riyaadus-Saaliheen</strong> by <strong>Sheikh Muhammad ibn al-Uthaymeen</strong>.(<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_3_1_1368165470438_853" style="text-align:justify;">In this class we read the explanation of the last hadith in the <strong>chapter of at-Taqwaa</strong> which is the sermon of the Messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam in the Farewell Pilgrimage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wednesday&#8217;s classes on the Explanation of Riyaadus-Saaliheen are held particularly for women after salatul-asr at Masjid Tawheed in Stone Mountain, GA. However, this is a book for us all to learn and benefit from, and we encourage everyone to join us.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Posted from</strong> : <a href="http://followthesalaf.com/blog/2013/5/8/explanation-of-riyaadhus-saaliheen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://followthesalaf.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>73.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) during the sermon of the Farewell Pilgrimage saying,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;"> &#8220;Be mindful of your duty to Allah; perform your five daily Salat, observe Saum during the month (of Ramadan) , pay the Zakat on your properties and obey your leaders; (if you do so) you will enter the Jannah of your Rubb&#8221;.</span><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>Commentary:</b> The word Wada`, means to say farewell. The Farewell Pilgrimage was the last pilgrimage, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) performed, and on this occasion he bade farewell to the people and for this reason it came to be known as Hajjat-ul-Wada`. Obedience of  the rulers is stressed but it is conditional, that is to say, they are to be obeyed only if their orders are not against the injunctions of Allah. Similarly, their obedience is obligatory till such time that they do not do anything which amounts to open disbelief. If any of these two things occurs, then no obedience would be due to them.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Both of them mean utter debasement in front of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and total submission to Him, openly and in secret. This comes along with perfect love for Allaah the Blessed and Exalted. Due to this, the Scholars divided between al-khashyah (dread) and al-khawf (fear). They said, “Indeed, al-khashyah is fear accompanied by glorification, whereas al-khawf can be accompanied by glorification and it can occur without glorification as well.” And this is true, since a person can fear an enemy. However, his fear of the enemy does not mean that he glorifies him. And he could fear a predatory animal, but his fear of that animal does not mean that he glorifies it. However, al-khashyah cannot be applied unless it is accompanied by glorification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</strong></span> [Sooratul-Anbiyaa‘ 21:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said about the Scholars who are the best of the creation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, those who fear Allaah the most from amongst His creation are the Scholars.”</span></strong> [Soorah Faatir 35:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, the Scholars of the Sharee’ah, the Scholars of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (’alayhis-salaatu was-salaam) who act upon their knowledge. So whoever observes this khashyah for other than Allaah, then he has committed Shirk. Allaah the Blessed and Exalted warned against that in His statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So do not fear them, but fear Me.”</strong></span> [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:150]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khasyah (awe) is fear founded upon knowledge of the greatness of the one whom you fear.It is something more particular than khawf. For example, if you fear someone but don’t know whether he is able to catch you or not, then this is khawf.
