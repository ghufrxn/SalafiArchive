										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <em><a style="text-decoration:none;" href="#">    </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 12: </font></p>
<p></a></em>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Gifts (Kitab Al-Hibat) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Hiba is defined as the transfer of the possession of  property, movable and immovable, from one person to the other willingly and without any  reward. The one who makes this transfer is known as donor (Wahib), and the thing  transferred is known as Mauhubah, and the one who is donated is known as Mauhub lahu  (donee). The other words used in the language of the Shar&#8217;i&#8217;ah are Nihla or &#8216;Atiyya. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of Hiba is not complete unless the donor surrenders  the possession of the thing donated. Moreover, the declaration of donation should be in  clear terms without any ambiguity (around them). This act of donation is based on the  following hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him):&#8221; Give presents to one  another for this would increase your mutual love.&#8221; This not only implies the legality  of gifts, but the exhortation to give these to one another. There is perfect agreement  amongst all the jurists that Hiba is valid in Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of donation can be made verbally or in writing by  any person capable of making a contract. A gift by a person involved in debt is invalid,  and gift in death illness cannot take effect beyond one-third of the assets of the  deceased after defraying all necessary expenses. The donation can be made to a living  person and not to one who is dead. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Shari&#8217;ah imposes certain restrictions on the property  which is to be donated. In the first place, the property must be in existence at the time  when the gift is given; hence the gift of oil in the sesame or of butter in the milk would  not be valid. The property once given as a gift cannot be revoked except in some  extraordinary circumstances. The father is entitled to get back the donation given by him  from his children if be finds it contrary to the laws and spirit of the Shari&#8217;ah. The  right to revoke a gift is called Raj&#8217;. This act of revocation can be done with the decree  of a competent court. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I    donated a pedigree horse in the path of Allah. Its possesser made it languish. I thought    that he would sell it at a cheap price. I asked Allah&#8217;s Menengsr (may peace be upon him)    about it, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who    gets back the charity is like a dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has been narrated    on the authority of Malik b. Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this    addition:&#8221; Don&#8217;t buy that even if he gives you for one dirham.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid b. Aslam reported on the authority of his father that    &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) donated a horse in the path of Allah. He found that it    had languished in the hand of its possessor, and he was a man of meagre resources He    (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) intended to buy it. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy that even if you get it    for a dirham for he who gets back the charity is like a dog which swallows its vomit.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zaid b.    Aslam with the same chain of transmitters but with this (change) that the hadith    transmitted on the authority of Malik and Rauh (he was the son of Qisirn) is more complete    and lengthy.</font></p>

He asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)    about it. whereupon he (the Holy prophet) said: Don&#8217;t buy that and do not get back what    you gave in charity.</font></p>

I said, &#8220;O my aunt! Then what use to sustain you?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;The two  black things: dates and water, our neighbors from Ansar had some Manarh and they used to  present Allah&#8217;s Apostle some of their milk and he used to make us drink.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place  in which you see now.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That his father said, &#8220;One day I was sitting with some  of the Prophet&#8217;s companions on the way to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ahead of us. All of  my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager  while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I  had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and  rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand  over to me the whip and the spear but they said, &#8216;No, by Allah, we shall not help you in  that in any way.&#8217; I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things  and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after  it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they  doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of  Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, &#8216;Do you have a portion of it with you?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while  he was in the state of Ihram . </font></p>

We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this  well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and &#8216;Umar in front  of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished, &#8216;Umar said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Here is Abu Bakr.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the remaining milk  to the bedouin and said twice, &#8220;The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the  right side.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;It is a Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions)&#8221; and  repeated it thrice. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa from &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle were in two groups. One group  consisted of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama  and the other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle loved  &#8216;Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would delay  it, till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home and then he would send his gift to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and  decided that Um Salama should request Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their  gifts to him in whatever wife&#8217;s house he was. Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what they  had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She  said, &#8220;He did not say anything to me.&#8221; They asked her to talk to him again. She  talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked  her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &#8220;Talk to him till he  gives you a reply.&#8221; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to  her, &#8220;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on  any of the beds except that of Aisha.&#8221; On that Um Salama said, &#8220;I repent to  Allah for hurting you.&#8221; Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and sent her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to say to him, &#8220;Your wives request to  treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.&#8221; Then Fatima conveyed the  message to him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t you love whom I love?&#8221;  She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested  her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him  and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter  of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to  her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort.  &#8216;Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha  and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the  resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of  Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a  sheep, it will be bleating.&#8221; The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the  whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

(When it came) Abu Bakr ordered an  announcer to announce that whoever had a money claim on the Prophet or was promised to be  given something, should come to Abu Bakr. I went to Abu Bakr and told him that the Prophet  had promised to give me so much. On that Abu Bakr gave me three handfuls (of money). </font></p>

The  Prophet said to the man, &#8220;Take it and give it in charity (as an expiation of your  sin).&#8221; The man said &#8220;Should I give it to some people who are poorer than we O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle?

So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and informed him of that, he asked them to accept the fruits of my garden and excuse my  father, but they refused. So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut  them and distribute them among them, but said, &#8220;I will come to you tomorrow  morning.&#8221; So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the  date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all  the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  told &#8216;Umar, who was sitting there, to listen to the story. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t we know  that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle?

He said to them,  &#8220;This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and the best statement to  me is the true one, so you may choose one of two alternatives; either the captives or the  property and (I have not distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had returned from Ta&#8217;if, he waited for  them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return  except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the  Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, &#8220;Then after:  These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return  their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and  whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e.  war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We  return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and  your leaders may present your decision to me.&#8221; The people went away, and their  leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all  of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly. (Az-Zuhn, the  sub-narrator said, &#8220;This is what we know about the captives, of Hawazin.&#8221;) </font></p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has land should  cultivate it himself or give it to his brother or keep it uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: A bedouin came to the Prophet and asked  him about emigration. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you. The  matter of emigration is difficult. Have you got some camels?&#8221; He replied in the  affirmative. The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Do you pay their Zakat?&#8221; He replied in the  affirmative. He asked, &#8220;Do you lend them so that their milk may be utilized by  others?&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Do you milk them  on the day off watering them?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do good deeds beyond the merchants (or the sea) and Allah will never disregard any  of your deeds.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 260, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Tawus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he was told by the most learned one amongst them (i.e.  Ibn Abbas) that the Prophet went towards some land which was flourishing with vegetation  and asked to whom it belonged. He was told that such and such a person took it on rent.  The Prophet said, &#8220;It would have been better (for the owner) if he had given it to  him gratis rather than charging him a fixed rent. </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: a person embraced Islam and the members of his family are still non-Muslims. Then his parents died leaving behind a legacy for him and his brothers. It is well-known that this Muslim person does not deserve inheritance from his father&#8217;s legacy. If his brothers offered him what they think is his share of inheritance, should he accept it? It is said that it is permissible for him to take it as a gift. If this is true, must he tell them that he will accept it as a gift or is his intention enough?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for this Muslim person to take the money offered for him by his father or brothers whether they are dead or alive as long as it does not draw him back to their religion and as long as they are rational people and know that he does not deserve inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
