<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Point 59</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Four <em>takbeers</em> (sayings of <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) are to be said for the funeral prayer. This was the saying of Maalik Bin Anas, Sufyaan ath-Thawree, <u>H</u>asan Ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u>, A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal and the <em>Fuqahaa</em> (jurists) and this was the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377778497&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/four-takbeers-are-to-be-said-for-the-funeral-prayer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>mas`alatun far`eeyah</em> (matter of detail). However, he mentioned it here because of the disagreement occurring with regard to it and to make clear the Sunnah in that regard because the book is called <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em> (Clarification of the Sunnah). And what is famous with the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) and with the Imaams is that the <em>takbeers</em> that are said over the <em>janaazah</em> (funeral prayer) are four <em>takbeers</em> as occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> prayed funeral prayer over An-Najaashee (the ruler of Abyssinia) in the absence of his body and he said four takbeers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And most of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> mention four and in some of the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>, there is an addition for five or more. However, that which the Muslims have consensus upon is four and whatever is additional to it is a point of disagreement and the Muslim should not go to that about which there is disagreement and leave aside that about which there is consensus and which there is agreement upon and therefore cause trouble to the people particularly with respect to the Imaams of the mosque; they should not cause trouble to the people because the people are not accustomed to any addition to four. So, if you want to pray over the <em>janaazah</em> more than four <em>takbeers</em> then do it yourself but do not cause trouble to the people and bring them rare and obscure sayings and divergent reports for this is not from the way of the student of knowledge. The students of knowledge should bring harmony amongst the people and not cause trouble to them and they should act upon which there is consensus and restrict themselves to that. This is what is required and this is the intent of the author in mentioning the four because that is what is agreed upon. So, they should not be added to and trouble therefore caused to people in that regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is the saying of Maalik Bin Anas and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and <u>H</u>asan Ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal,” </strong>Maalik ibn Anas is the Imaam of <em>Daarul-Hijrah</em>  (the Imaam of the place where the <em>Hijrah</em> was to, meaning the Imaam of Madeenah); Imaam Maalik was one of the four Imaams. And Sufyaan ath-Thawree; he was Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed ath-Thawree, the famous Imaam from the Imaams of <em>fiqh.</em> And Al-<u>H</u>asan ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> ibn <u>H</u>ayy; he was from the major Imaams. And A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal; he was one of the four Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it was the saying of the jurists; the people of <em>fiqh</em>, <em>Fuqahaa</em> and this was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,” </strong>meaning it is the saying of many of the jurists who are following the Sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, it is not befitting for the student of knowledge to cause trouble with the people with the argument that he knows that there is another saying or another <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> with regard to an addition. The scholars used to know that there was disagreement in certain matters but they would not bring this and cause trouble to the people nor would they contradict that which action was upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Najaashee died in his own land, nobody prayed over him in his own land so the Prophet was informed by revelation that he had died so led the companions in Madeenah in funeral prayer for An-Najaashee in that different land and said four <em>takbeers</em> over the <em>janaazah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (1,245) and reported by Muslim (951) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 31 : Point 40</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>والصلاة على من مات من أهل القبلة سنة والمرجوم والزاني والزانية والذي يقتل نفسه وغيره من أهل القبلة والسكران وغيرهم الصلاة عليهم سنة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to pray over whoever dies from the People of the <em>Qiblah </em>is the Sunnah and over the one who has been stoned to death and the male fornicator and the female fornicator and the one who commits suicide and other than him from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> and the drunkard and other than them, the funeral prayer over them is the Sunnah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374257166&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-pray-over-whoever-dies-from-the-people-of-the-qiblah-is-the-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is just as has preceded that whoever manifests <em>eemaan</em> and Islaam, we pray funeral prayer over him and he is from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> and they are those who pray towards the <em>Ka’bah (</em>the direction of prayer of the Muslims), those people we deal with them in accordance with what is apparent so we judge them to be Muslims and we treat them as we treat the Muslims whilst they are alive and when they are dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and likewise the one who has been stoned to death and the male fornicator and the female fornicator and the one who has committed suicide and other than him from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em>”, </strong>the sinful believer who does not exit from Islaam on account of his major sin is treated as a Muslim and supplication is made for him just like the person who commits suicide and just like the one who is stoned for fornication and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed funeral prayer over those who were stoned to death. He prayed over Maa`iz <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and over Al-Ghaamidiyyah; the woman of the Ghaamidiyyah tribe <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would withhold from praying over some people such as the one who committed suicide and such as the person who misappropriated something from the booty in Allaah’s cause in order to discipline the people not because he was a disbeliever and therefore he gave permission to the companions to pray upon him and he did not prevent them from prayer over him because he is still a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the drunkard and other than them, the prayer over them is Sunnah”, </strong>the one who drinks alcohol is a <em>faasiq</em> (sinner), the <em><u>h</u>add</em> (prescribed punishment) is established upon him. However, he does not exit from Islaam. So, if he dies then he is prayed over even if he used to drink alcohol because he is still from the People of the <em>Qibla</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>it is the Sunnah”, </strong>meaning it is from the Sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which it is obligatory to follow.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This incident of Maa`iz with the long story connected to it; he came and he admitted what he had done and sought that he should be stoned to death is reported in Al-Bukhaariyy (6,820) in the book of <em><u>h</u>udood</em> (prescribed punishments), Chapter 25 ‘Stoning to Death at the Mu<u>s</u>allaa (outdoor place of prayer)’ from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> contains the wording there when it mentions his story and that he was stoned to death and then at the end of it occurs that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said with regard to that wording there it is quoted at the end of the narration in a disconnected form and Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said in <em>Irwa</em>` <em>Al Ghalil</em> Volume 7, page 353 that this narration is actually <em>shaaddah</em> (contrary to what’s authentic) that the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself prayed over Maa`iz is contrary to the correct reports. It’s only reported by one narrator Mahmood ibn Gheelaan to the exclusion of all other narrators of this <u>h</u>adeeth and Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar mentions their names in <em>Fathul Baari</em> Volume 12, page 115-116. Likewise, in addition Aboo Daawood reports in his Sunan <u>h</u>adeeth 3,186 from Aboo Burdah Al-Aslami that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not pray over Maa`iz ibn Malik and he did not forbid prayer over him.  Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said this report by Aboo Daawood is hasan, saheeh (good, authentic), Allaahu A’lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> This <u>h</u>adeeth that she was stoned to death and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed over her, <u>h</u>adeeth being reported by Muslim (1,695) from <u>h</u>adeeth of Buraydah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author affirming that the prayer is said over all of them, there is <em>taf<u>s</u>eel</em>  (detail) here  that needs to be mentioned, which is that he is to be prayed over by everyone <strong>except for the <em>Imaam</em> (ruler)</strong> because it is not befitting that the ruler should pray over those people so that the sinful people should not become emboldened to commit those sins and crimes. Rather, what is befitting is that they should be deterred from that. So, the ruler should not pray the funeral prayer over them. Rather, his deputy should pray over him so that the people should know that the ruler not praying over those people who have died, they should recognise it, it will be a deterrent for them and the people should recognise how despicable that action is, which has led the ruler to stay back from praying the funeral prayer over him. As for the rest of the nation then they should pray over those people.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3112 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha that Prophet<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Perform a portion of your prayer in your homes and do not make your homes as graves unlike the Jews and the Christians who placed graves in their homes.Indeed the house in which the Qur’aan is recited will be made apparent to the people of the Heaven just as the stars are made apparent to the people of the earth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhahabi said at the end of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth has a clean <em>Isnaad</em> and its text is<em>Hasan</em>. It is a prohibition of burying people in houses and there is a supporting narration with another chain.The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>prohibited building over graves and if the people were to be buried in their homes, then graves and houses would become one thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer in a graveyard is prohibited, whether it is a prohibition due to dislike or a prohibition meaning Haraam. The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said: ‘The best prayer of a man is in his house except for that which is obligatory.’So it is appropriate that homes are not taken as graves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> being buried in the house of ‘Aa’ishah then this is specific to the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.Just as his garment being spread out under him in the niche of his grave was specifically for him and just as it was specific to him that they each Companion prayed over him, individually, without an <em>Imam</em>, since he was their <em>Imam</em> in life and in death, in the <em>Dunya</em>and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it was also specific to him that his burial was delayed for two days, contrary to his <em>Ummah</em> for whom it is not allowed to delay the burial, since the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> is protected from change after death unlike us.They delayed his burial so that everyone could pray over him at his house and, therefore, the delay was due to that matter and also their being hesitant regarding his death for half the day until Abu Bakr came forward with his opinion.This was the reason for the delay.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.7 Hadeeth no.3112p.306-307]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From the <em>Fatawaa</em> of our Shaykh, <em>Allaama Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is reading the Qur’aan for the deceased- by placing copies of the Qur’aan in the home or house of the deceased – where some Muslim neighbours and friends come and each one of them reads a part for example, then they go off to their work and they are not paid for reciting …… And after they finish reciting they supplicate for the deceased and gift him the reward for reciting the Qur’aan … Does this recitation and supplication reach the deceased and is he rewarded or not?  I hope for a benefit and I am grateful to you….. Taking into account that I heard some of the scholars saying that it is absolutely prohibited, some saying it is disliked and some saying it is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This action and the like of it has no foundation and it is not recorded on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> nor on the authority of his Companions <em>-radiAllaah anhum</em><em> &#8211;</em> that they used to read for the deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim in his authentic book and Bukhari mentioned it without a complete chain but he was decisive about its authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in the two Saheehs of Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha</em><em> –</em> on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>who said: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Muslim on the authority of Jaabir <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em><em> &#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to say in his <em>Khutbah</em> on Fridays: <em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones.  Every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every<em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nisa’ee mentioned an extra wording with an authentic chain: ‘and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for charity for the deceased and supplicating for them, then that benefits and reaches them and the Muslims are in consensus aboutthat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah is the capability and Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 339</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wish from the eminent Shaykh that he clarifies for the Muslims the ruling of reciting the Qur’aan over the dead, is it permissible or not?  And what is the ruling of the Ahadeeth that mention this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reading over the dead has no foundation which can be relied upon nor is there any legislation for this.  Indeed what has beensanctioned is reading the Qur’aan amongst the living so they can benefit and reflect upon the Book of Allaah and understand it.  As for reciting over the deceased at his grave or after his death &#8211; before his burial &#8211; or reading for him in any place so that the reward can be gifted to him, then we do not know of a foundation for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have authored works and written many books, of them there are those who have allowed and encouraged reciting the whole of the Qur’aan upon the deceased and they regarded it from the same category of giving charity with wealth.  There are those from the people of knowledge who say that these matters are dependent upon evidence; which means that they are from aspects of worship so it is not permissible to perform them except with what the <em>Sharia’ </em>affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence for this issue – as far as we know – which indicates the permissibility of reciting for the dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence regarding this issue from what we know which indicates the legality of reading over the dead, so it is necessary to remain upon the original foundation which is that worship is dependent upon evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So reciting for the dead should not be done, in contrast to giving charity on their behalf, supplicating for them, Hajj, Umrah and paying off debts, then these matters benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are texts which mention this and it is established from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: ‘When the son of Aadam dies his actions are severed except for three: recurring charity,knowledge which he can benefit from or a righteous child who supplicates for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu &#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who came after them [i.e. after his Companions] say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful’ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hashr:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah has praised those who came later because they supplicated for those who preceded them.  This indicates theallowance of supplicating for the deceased of the Muslims and that itdoes benefit them.  Likewise, charity benefits them due to theaforementioned hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to give charity to the poor and needy people with the money used to hire someone to recite over the dead with the intention that it is for the deceased and that the deceased benefits with this money and saves himself from the vulgarity of <em>Bida’</em>.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established in the Saheeh that a man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah my mother has passed away and did not leave a bequest and I think that if she had spoken she would have given charity.  Will she receive a reward if I gave charity on her behalf?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> clarified that charity on behalf of the deceased benefits him and likewise Hajj and Umrah on his behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are ahadeeth which mention this, likewise paying off debt benefits him.  As for a reward for the deceased for reciting Qur’aan or gifting it to the dead, praying or optional fasting on his behalf then all of this has no basis and what is correct is that it is not fromthe <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 340- 341</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 159<br />
About Speedy Repayment of the Debts of a Deceased Person and Preparation of<br />
Burial</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>943.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The soul of the deceased believer remains pending on account of the debt till it (the debt) is repayed.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>944.</b> Hussain bin Wahwah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Talhah bin Al-Bara&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) fell ill, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to visit him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, I think that Talhah is about to die. So inform me when he is dead and make haste (in burying him). Indeed, it is improper for the corpse of a Muslim to be kept lying unburied among his family members.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 157<br />
Supplications in Funeral Prayers</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To pronounce four Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar) in the funeral prayer. After the first Takbir, after saying A`udhu billahi minash-Shaitanir-rajim, recite Surat Al-Fatihah. After the second Takbir, send Salam [Allahumma Salli `ala Muhammadin wa `ala ali Muhammadin kama sallaita `ala Ibrahima wa `ala ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid. Allahumma barik `ala Muhammadin wa `ala ali Muhammadin, kama barakta `ala Ibrahima, wa `ala ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid. Then after the third Takbir, invoke supplication for the deceased and for the Muslims as we will mention later on, in sha&#8217; Allah. After the fourth Takbir, supplicate Allah. (Some of the supplications of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), which are to be recited after the third Takbir are mentioned in the following Ahadith:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>935.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Abdur-Rahman `Auf bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) offered a funeral prayer and I memorized his supplication. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prayed:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahummaghfir lahu, warhamhu, wa `afihi, wa`fu `anhu, wa akrim nuzulahu, wa wassi` mudkhalahu, waghsilhu bil-ma&#8217;i wath-thalji wal-baradi, wa naqqihi minal-khataya, kama naqqaytath-thawbal-abyada minad-danasi, wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi, wa ahlan khairan min ahlihi, wa zawjan khairan min zawjihi, wa adkhilhul-Jannata, wa a`idh-hu min `adhabil-qabri, wa min `adhabin-nar [if the dead person is a woman, one should change the ending of certain words in this supplication from hu to ha] (O Allah! Forgive him, bestow mercy upon him, pardon him, accord him a noble provision and make his grave spacious, wash him with water, snow and hail, purify him from sins as You have purified the white garment from soiling, give him a better abode in place of his present one, and a better family in exchange of his present one, and a better spouse in place of his present wife; admit him to Jannah and protect from the trial in the grave and punishment in the Hell).&#8221;</span> (After hearing this supplication of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), Abu&#8217; Abdur-Rahman &#8216;Auf bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I wished I had been that dead man.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>936.</b> Abu Hurairah, Abu Qatadah, and Abu Ibrahim Al-Ash-hali (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) offered a funeral prayer and said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahummaghfir lihaiyina wa maiyitina, wa saghirina wa kabirina, wa dhakarina wa unthana, wa shahidina wa gha&#8217;ibina. Allahumma man ahyaiytahu minna, fa&#8217;ahyihi `alal-Islam, wa man tawaffaiytahu minna, fatawaffahu `alal-Iman. Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahu, wa la taftinna ba`dahu (O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, our present and our absent, our young and our old, our male and our female. O Allah, whosoever of us You keep alive, keep him alive (faithful) to IslÀm, and whosoever of us You cause to die, let him die having Iman.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>940.</b> `Abdullah bin Abu Aufa (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> While offering the funeral prayer of one of his daughters, he recited four Takbir, and after the fourth Takbir he continued standing for a time equal to an interval between two Takbir, praying for her and seeking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for her.&#8221; Then he said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: He (Abdullah) recited four Takbir and remained standing in prayer for some time till we thought that he would recite the fifth Takbir. Then he gave Salam on the right and on the left. When he turned aside, we asked him about it. He replied:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I would add nothing to what I saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) doing,&#8221;</span> or he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 153<br />
The Ruling of crying and wailing over a Dead Person</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wailing is unanimously forbidden (Haram) as will be mentioned later on. There are some Ahadith which forbid us from crying over somebody&#8217;s death, and which inform us that the dead will be tormented in their graves as a result of their relatives crying over their death. This prohibition applies only to those cases where crying is accompanied with lamenting and wailing. Weeping without these two is, permissible; and the Ahadith in support of this are many, including the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>925.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited Sa`d bin `Ubadah during his illness. He was accompanied by `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with them). The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) began to weep. When his Companions saw this, their tears also started flowing. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you not hear, Allah does not punish for the shedding of tears or the grief of the heart, but punishes or bestows mercy for the utterances of this (and he pointed to his tongue).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>926.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A grandson (child of the daughter) of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was presented to him while the child was at his last breath. Tears began to flow from the eyes of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). Sa`d said to him: &#8220;What is this, O Messenger of Allah?&#8217;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is mercy which Allah has placed in the hearts of his salves. Allah bestows His Mercy on the merciful among His slaves.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>927.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to his son Ibrahim (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was breathing his last. The eyes of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) began shedding tears. `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf  (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you too weep?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Ibn `Auf! It is mercy.&#8221;</span> Then he began to weep and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The eyes are shedding tears and the heart is grieved, and we will not say except what pleases our Rubb. O Ibrahim! Indeed we are grieved by your departure.&#8221;</span><br />

Praising the Deceased</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>950.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Some Companions happened to pass by a funeral procession (bier) and they praised him (the deceased). The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221;</span> Then they passed by another funeral procession and they spoke ill of the deceased. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221;</span> `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;(O Messenger of Allah,) what do you mean by `He will certainly enter it?&#8217;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You praised the first person, so he will enter Jannah; and you spoke ill of the second person, so he will enter Hell. You are Allah&#8217;s witnesses on earth.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>951.</b> Abul-Aswad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I came to Al-Madinah, and while I was sitting beside `Umar bin Al-Khattab, a funeral procession passed by. The people praised the deceased, and `Umar bin Al-Khattab said: &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221; Then another funeral procession passed by and the people praised the deceased. `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221; A third funeral procession passed by and the people spoke ill of the deceased. He said: &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221; I (Abul-Aswad) asked: &#8220;O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin (i.e., Leader of the Believers)! What do you mean by `He will certainly enter it&#8217;?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I said the same as was said by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `If four persons testify the righteousness of a Muslim, Allah will grant him Jannah.&#8217;</span> We asked: `If three persons testify his righteousness?&#8217; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Even three&#8217;.</span> Then we asked:<span style="color:#008000;"> `</span>If two?&#8217; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Even two.&#8217;</span> We did not ask him (regarding the testimony) of one.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Anyone who dies worshipping others along with Allah will definitely enter the Fire.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Anyone who dies worshipping none along with Allah will definitely enter Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 331:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">to follow the funeral procession. to visit the sick, to accept invitations, to help the oppressed, to fulfill the oaths, to return the greeting and to reply to the sneezer: (saying, &#8220;May Allah be merciful on you,&#8221; provided the sneezer says, &#8220;All the praises are for Allah,&#8221;). He forbade us to use silver utensils and dishes and to wear golden rings, silk (clothes), Dibaj (pure silk cloth), Qissi and Istabraq (two kinds of silk cloths).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and kissed him and then started weeping and said, &#8220;My father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas : Abu Bakr came out and &#8216;Umar , was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but &#8216;Umar refused.

Then Abu Bakr recited the Tashah-hud (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and the people attended to Abu Bakr and left &#8216;Umar. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: &#8216;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.&#8217; &#8221; (3.144) (The narrator added, &#8220;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it &#8220;)</p>

I testify that Allah has honored you&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8216;How do you know that Allah has honored him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you! On whom else shall Allah bestow His honor?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;No doubt, death came to him. By Allah, I too wish him good, but by Allah, I do not know what Allah will do with me though I am Al lah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216; By Allah, I never attested the piety of anyone after that.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been given the choice for Allah says: &#8216;(It does not avail) Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites), or do not ask for forgiveness for them. Even though you ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will not forgive them.

<p style="text-align:justify;">We emigrated with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) in Allah&#8217;s cause, and so our reward was then surely incumbent on Allah. Some of us died and they did not take anything from their rewards in this world, and amongst them was Mustab bin &#8216;Umar; and the others were those who got their rewards. Mustab bin &#8216;Umar was martyred on the day of the Battle of Uhud and we could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And when we covered his head his feet became bare and vice versa. So the Prophet ordered us to cover his head only and to put idhkhir (a kind of shrub) over his feet.</p>

So he came out wearing it as his waist-sheet. A man praised it and said, &#8220;Will you give it to me? How nice it is!&#8221; The other people said, &#8220;You have not done the right thing as the Prophet is in need of it and you have asked for it when you know that he never turns down anybody&#8217;s request.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;By Allah, I have not asked for it to wear it but to make it my shroud.&#8221; Later it was his shroud.</p>

The Prophet got up, and so did Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, Muadh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men. The child was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks that Usama added: ) as if it was a leather water-skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started shedding tears. Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;It is mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the daughters of &#8216;Uthman died at Mecca. We went to attend her funeral procession. Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Abbas were also present. I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat beside me.) &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Will you not prohibit crying as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said, &#8216;The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives.?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Umar used to say so.&#8221; Then he added narrating, &#8220;I accompanied Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), &#8220;Go and see who those travelers are.&#8221; So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to &#8216;Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, &#8220;Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.&#8221; Later, when &#8216;Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, &#8220;O my brother, O my friend!&#8221; (on this &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, &#8220;The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?&#8221; Ibn Abbas added, &#8220;When &#8216;Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: &#8216;No burdened soul will bear another&#8217;s burden.&#8217; &#8221; (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, &#8220;Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.&#8221; Ibn Umar did not say anything after that.</p>

I told him, &#8216;I am reduced to this state because of illness and I am wealthy and have no inheritors except a daughter, (In this narration the name of &#8216;Amir bin Sad is mentioned and in fact it is a mistake; the narrator is &#8216;Aisha bint Sad bin Abi Waqqas). Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One-third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for poor Sad bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sad bin Abi Waqqas lived long after the Prophet (p.b.u.h).)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet collected every two martyrs of Uhud (in one grave) and then he would ask, &#8220;Which of them knew the Quran more?&#8221; And if one of them was pointed out for him as having more knowledge, he would put him first in the Lahd. The Prophet said, &#8220;I will be a witness on these on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Then he ordered them to be buried with their blood on their bodies and he did not have them washed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar set out along with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&#8221; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, &#8220;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&#8221; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad answered, &#8220;True people and liars visit me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have been confused as to this matter.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&#8221; (2) The Prophet said, &#8220;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Umar added): Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&#8221; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: &#8216;The pure Allah&#8217;s Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.&#8217; &#8221; (30.30).</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Abu Talib, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;) while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; (Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113).</p>

He said, &#8220;They are being tortured not for a great thing (to avoid). One of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine, while the other was going about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends). He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

He then said, &#8220;There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched.&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. &#8221; (92.5-6)</p>

And whoever commits suicide with piece of iron will be punished with the same piece of iron in the Hell Fire.&#8221; Narrated Jundab the Prophet said, &#8220;A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed suicide, and so Allah said: My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him.&#8221;</p>

Are you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and such occasions?&#8221; And started mentioning all that he had said. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and said, &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! Go away from me.&#8221; When I talked too much he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the prayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have done so.&#8221; (&#8216;Umar added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered his funeral prayer and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara&#8217; were revealed: i.e. &#8220;And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)&#8221; &#8212; (&#8216;Umar added), &#8220;Later I astonished at my daring before Allah&#8217;s Apostle on that day.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &#8220;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&#8221; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &#8220;Ma sha&#8217;a-llah&#8221; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &#8216;What Allah wished,&#8217; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &#8216;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&#8217; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &#8216;That is your place.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let me enter my place.&#8217; They said, &#8216;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 469:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, &#8216;In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.&#8217; Abu Bakr further asked her, &#8216;On which day did the Prophet die?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;He died on Monday.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;What is today?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Today is Monday.&#8217; He added, &#8216;I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.&#8217; Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, &#8216;Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.&#8217; I said, &#8216;This is worn out.&#8217; He said, &#8216;A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body&#8217;s pus.&#8217; He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 470:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;My mother died suddenly and I thought that if she had lived she would have given alms. So, if I give alms now on her behalf, will she get the reward?&#8221; The Prophet replied in the affirmative.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 471:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During his sickness, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asking repeatedly, &#8220;Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221; And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Allah took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 472:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his fatal illness said, &#8220;Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet&#8217;s grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 473:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Aiyash :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan At-Tammar told me that he had seen the grave of the Prophet elevated and convex.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 474:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin &#8216;Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I (&#8216;Urwa) said to them, &#8220;By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of Umar.&#8221; Aisha narrated that she made a will to &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair, &#8220;Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 475:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&#8217; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&#8221; (So, Ibn &#8216;Umar conveyed the message to &#8216;Aisha.) She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&#8216;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar returned, &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What (news) do you have?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&#8216;Aisha ) and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&#8221; and then he mentioned the name of &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&#8217;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 476:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t abuse the dead, because they have reached the result of what they forwarded.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 477:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas.:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lahab, may Allah curse him, once said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Perish you all the day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;Perish the hands of Abi Lahab! And perish he!&#8221; (111.1).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 478:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thy Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen and said, &#8220;Invite the people to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 479:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has something to ask. (What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 480:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this.&#8221; When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 481:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zur&#8217;a:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from the Prophet the same as above.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 482:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth of the booty in Allah&#8217;s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba&#8217;, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 483:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), &#8216;Umar, said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How can you fight with these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah&#8217;s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In both The Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, janazah prayer is conducted after almost every congregational prayer. Learn this prayer before you leave for The Holy Land so that there will be greater depth to your participation in this prayer]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the manner of performing Funeral Prayer?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The manner of performing Funeral Prayer is that the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) begins by pronouncing <strong>Takbirat-ul-Ihram</strong> (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) and <strong>seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recites the <strong>Basmalah</strong> (saying, &#8220;Bismillah Al-Rahman, Al-Rahim [In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful]&#8221;) and <strong>Al-Fatihah</strong> (the opening chapter of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an, Surah number I). It is desirable that he recites a short Surah after Al-Fatihah, such as <strong>Al-Ikhlas or Al-`Asr</strong>, or some Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses). It was authentically related from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) which indicates this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the Imam should pronounce the <strong>second Takbir</strong> (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) and invoke Allah&#8217;s <strong>peace upon the Prophet</strong>(peace be upon him) in the same manner a person invokes Allah&#8217;s peace upon him in the final Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/ last unit of Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam pronounces the <strong>third Takbir</strong> and supplicates to Allah for the deceased with the well-known supplications (of the Prophet), being attentive to mentioning the correct gender and plural pronouns for multiple funerals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the Imam pronounces the <strong>fourth Takbir</strong> followed by a moment of silence and then recites Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) once to his right only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opening invocation, there is no harm in either saying it or not. Yet it is better to omit it in accordance with the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Hastenthefuneralproceedings"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="112424" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Hasten the funeral proceedings&#8230;</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="color:#000000;"></b><b>Q: Would you please explain to us how should the Funeral Prayer be performed</b><b> as reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him), </b>because many people do not know how it should be performed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A</strong>: The manner of performing Funeral Prayer was demonstrated by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) as follows: It begins with pronouncing Takbirat-ul-Ihram and seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan. Then, the Imam recites the Basmalah and Al-Fatihah followed by a short Surah or some Ayahs. Then, he pronounces Takbir and invokes Allah&#8217;s peace upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) as one does at the end of the Prayer. Then, he pronounces a third Takbir and supplicates to Allah for the deceased.</p>
<p>The best is to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><a style="color:#008000;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></a><a style="color:#008000;" name="OAllah,forgiveourlivingand"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="26344" class="tip"></span>O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, those who are present among us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our males and our females. O Allah, whoever You decree to live, let him live in Islam and whoever You cause to die, cause him to die withIman (Faith). </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound and forgive him, honor the place where he settles and make his entrance wide; wash him with water, snow and hail, and cleanse him of sins as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">O Allah, give him a house better than his house and a family better than his family. O Allah, admit him to Paradise and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of Hell-fire; make his grave spacious and fill it with light. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">O Allah, do not deprive us of the reward and do not cause us to go astray after this.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was recorded from the Prophet (peace be upon him). If you supplicate to Allah using other words, this is fine. For example, one may say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Allah, if he was a doer of good, then increase his good deeds; and if he was a wrongdoer, then forgive his bad deeds. O Allah, forgive him and give him the strength to say the right thing.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, after a fourth Takbir there is a short pause ending with one Taslim to the right. This was narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of Sunnah (action following the teachings of the Prophet) that the Imam stands at the head of the body if the deceased is a male and by its middle if it is the body of a female as authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anas </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Samurah ibn Jundub </span>(may Allah be pleased with them both). As for the opinion held by some scholars that it is prescribed in the Sunnah that the Imam stands at the chest of the body if the deceased is a male, this is a weak opinion that has no basis as far as we know. When performing Funeral Prayer, the dead body should be positioned facing the direction of the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer), because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#008000;"><a style="color:#008000;" name="ItistheQiblah(Kabah-direction"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112426" class="tip"></span>It is the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer) of Muslims while living i.e. during Prayer and after death [in the grave].</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span> May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Learn the dua&#8217;s ( taken from Hisn al Muslim, Darussalam Publishers)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>For the deceased in the funeral prayer:</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">[Note: The following  are for funeral of a male Muslim, change it accordingly for female Muslimah]</span></em></p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">اللهُمِّ اغْفِرْ لِحَيِّنا وَمَيِّتِنا وَشاهِدِنا ، وَغائِبِنا ، وَصَغيرِنا وَكَبيرِنا ، وَذَكَرِنا وَأُنْثانا. اللهُمِّ مَنْ أَحْيَيْتَهُ مِنّا فَأَحْيِهِ عَلى الإِسْلام ،وَمَنْ تَوَفَّيْتَهُ مِنّا فَتَوَفَّهُ عَلى الإِيمان ، اللهُمِّ لا تَحْرِمْنا أَجْرَه ، وَلا تُضِلَّنا بَعْدَه</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahum-maghfir lihayyinaa, wa mayyitinaa, wa shaahidinaa, wa ghaa&#8217;ibinaa, wa sagheerinaa wa kabeerinaa, wa thakarinaa wa &#8216;unthaanaa. Allaahumma man &#8216;ahyaytahu minnaa fa&#8217;ahyihi &#8216;alal-&#8216;Islaami, wa man tawaffaytahu minnaa fatawaffahu &#8216;alal-&#8216;eemaani, Allaahumma laa tahrimnaa &#8216;ajrahu wa laa tudhillanaa ba&#8217;dahu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, those who are with us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our menfolk and our womenfolk. O Allah, whomever you give life from among us give him life in Islam, and whomever you take way from us take him away in Faith. O Allah, do not forbid us their reward and do not send us astray after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Majah 1/480, Ahmad 2/368. See also Al-Albani, Sahih Ibn Majah 1/251.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">اللهُمِّ اغْفِرْ لَهُ وَارْحَمْه ، وَعافِهِ وَاعْفُ عَنْه ، وَأَكْرِمْ نُزُلَه ، وَوَسِّعْ مُدْخَلَه ، وَاغْسِلْهُ بِالْماءِ وَالثَّلْجِ وَالْبَرَدْ ، وَنَقِّهِ مِنَ الْخطايا كَما نَقّيْتَ الثَّوْبُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الدَّنَسْ ، وَأَبْدِلْهُ داراً خَيْراً مِنْ دارِه ، وَأَهْلاً خَيْراً مِنْ أَهْلِه ، وَزَوْجَاً خَيْراً مِنْ زَوْجِه ، وَأَدْخِلْهُ الْجَنَّة ، وَأَعِذْهُ مِنْ عَذابِ القَبْر وَعَذابِ النّار</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahum-maghfir lahu warhamhu, wa &#8216;aafihi, wa&#8217;fu &#8216;anhu, wa &#8216;akrim nuzulahu, wa wassi&#8217; mudkhalahu, waghsilhu bilmaa&#8217;i waththalji walbaradi, wa naqqihi minal-khataayaa kamaa naqqaytath-thawbal-&#8216;abyadha minad-danasi, wa &#8216;abdilhu daaran khayran min daarihi, wa &#8216;ahlan khayran min &#8216;ahlihi, wa zawjan khayran min zawjihi, wa &#8216;adkhilhul-jannata, wa. &#8216;a&#8217;ithhu min &#8216;athaabil-qabri[wa &#8216;athaabin-naar].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him and give him strength and pardon him. Be generous to him and cause his entrance to be wide and wash him with water and snow and hail. Cleanse him of his transgressions as white cloth is cleansed of stains. Give him an abode better than his home, and a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife. Take him into Paradise and protect him from the punishment of the grave [and from the punishment of Hell-fire].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheeh Muslim 2/663.</p>
<p><strong>The funeral prayer for deceased child:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">اللهُمَّ أَعِذْهُ مِن عَذَابِ القَبْرِ<br />
اللهُـمِّ اجْعَلْـهُ فَرَطـاً وَذُخْـراً لِوالِـدَيهِ، وَشَفـيعاً مُجَـاباً، اللهُـمِّ ثَـقِّلْ بِهِ مَوازيـنَهُما، وَأَعْـظِمْ بِهِ أُجُـورَهُـما، وَأَلْـحِقْـهُ بِصَالِـحِ الـمؤْمِنـين، وَاجْعَلْـهُ في كَِفـَالَةِ إِبْـراهـيم، وَقِهِ بِرَحْمَـتِكَ عَذابَ الْجَـحِيمِ, وَأَبْـدِلْهُ داراً خَـيْراً مِنْ دارِه ، وَأَهْلاً خَـيْراً مِنْ أَهْلِـه, اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لإِسْلافِنَا, وَأَفْراطِنَا, وَمَنْ سَبَقَنَاَ بِالإِيمَان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma &#8216;a&#8217;ith-hu min &#8216;athaabil-qabri. Allaahum-maj&#8217;alhufaratan wa thukhran liwaalidayhi, wa shafee&#8217;an mujaaban. Allaahumma thaqqil bihi mawaazeenahumaa wa &#8216;a&#8217;dhim bihi &#8216;ujoorahumaa, wa &#8216;alhiqhu bisaalihil-mu&#8217;mineena, waj&#8217;alhu fee kafaalati &#8216;Ibraaheema, wa qihi birahmatika &#8216;athaabal-jaheemi, wa &#8216;abdilhu daaran khayran min daarihi, wa &#8216;ahlan khayran min &#8216;ahlihi, Allaahum-maghfir li&#8217;aslaafinaa, wa &#8216;afraatinaa wa man sabaqanaa bil&#8217;eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah, protect him from the torment of the grave. O Allah, make him a precursor, a forerunner and a treasure for his parents and an answered intercessor. O Allah, make him weigh heavily in their scales (of good) and magnify their reward. Make him join the righteous of the believers. Place him in the care of Ibrahim. Save him by Your mercy from the torment of Hell. Give him a home better than his home and a family better than his family. O Allah, forgive those who have gone (i.e. passed away) before us, our children lost (by death), and those who have preceded us in Faith.</p>
