<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The research was carried out in Riyadh-based <strong>King Saud University (KSU)</strong> to discover the health benefits of Ajwa dates, which resulted in the finding that the fruit has <strong>anti-inflammatory properties</strong> similar to commercially available drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The study found that the inhibition rate in Ajwa was equal to existing commercial <strong>anti-oxidant products</strong> available in the market. The research was published in the 61st issue of the US-based journal for agriculture and food chemistry, a KSU official said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The official said that professor Muraleedharan Nair, head of the natural materials laboratory at the University of Michigan, conducted the research in collaboration with KSU’s date palm research chair. A number of researchers from both the universities participated in the study.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saleh A. Aldosari, the chair’s supervisor, said the research was the first among a series of studies being conducted at the center to study the main types of dates found in Saudi Arabia. The research projects are supported by KSU as well as King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and the Kingdom’s national plan for research projects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">King Saud University has adopted a policy of pursuing scientific leadership through its many scientific research chairs, which are sponsored by the university’s agency for graduate studies and scientific research.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dark brown Ajwa date from the Madinah region of the Kingdom is known for its softness, dryness and high price in the Kingdom’s date market.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also mentioned the benefits of the Ajwa, saying they prevent certain diseases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to health experts, Ajwa dates contain many flavonoid glycosides, which have <strong>anti-oxidant properties</strong>. Beyond the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, the sugar in Ajwa dates is only monosaccharaides, making the date <strong>beneficial for people who suffer from Type 2 diabetes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ajwa dates are also found to have a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory effect that is similar to commercial <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, celebrex and naproxen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Treatment with Hijamah versus medical denial</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Useful note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Treatment with Hijamah (cupping) and doctors&#8217; denial of its effectiveness:</strong> Hijamah has great effect on health. It is stated in the Hadith of Isra&#8217; (Night Journey): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>Whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by a host of angels they would instruct him to command his Ummah (the Muslim nation) to use Hijamah&#8221;</strong></span>. There are waste products that remain in the blood from substances circulated and secreted throughout the body. Unless such waste products are gradually cleared little by little, they would cause great harm to people risking their lives. Since the human body continuously produces substances that are surplus to its requirements, Hijamah has been introduced. Yet, doctors see it ineffective, and this is not strange, for they lack great deal of knowledge about many matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is fair to give each person their right, and doctors should be given their due rights relating to their profession. Yet treatment of diseases is beyond comprehension and restriction, and doctors are not experienced in a lot of methods outside their area of specialization. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little</strong></span>. (Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 85) Doctors often deny particular matters prescribed by Shari`ah (Islamic law) due to their great ignorance of their effectiveness. This is because many of them are westernized, have studied under western teachers, or they mainly derive their knowledge from western sources of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their denial of many of the matters prescribed by Shari`ah is not, however, based on scientific principles, but rather a blind pursuance of those who deny prophethood and imperceptible matters such as existence of Jinn (creatures created from fire) and the effect of the envious eye. For instance, they diagnose possession by Jinn as nervous disorders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Issued by His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Al-Shaykh, may Allah be merciful to him]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A- Benefits related to <em>Hijaama</em> (Cupping)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> after speaking about the <em>Neeyah</em> (intention) and purpose, says that they are from the actions of the heart and it is a must to follow the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> with regard to intention and purpose:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From this issue is that when the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> had <em>Hijaama </em>performed upon him and ordered others to have <em>Hijaama</em> performed upon them, he said in an authentic hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Cure/treatment for my <em>Ummah</em> is in the incision made by the one who performs <em>Hijaama</em> , by drinking honey or cauterization but I do not like to be cauterized.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was well-known that the purpose of <em>Hijaama</em> was <strong><span style="color:#000000;">to extract blood which is harmful to the body</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hijaama</em> is mentioned because <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>in hot countries blood rises to the surface of the body</strong></span> and so <em>Hijaama</em> removes that blood.  This is why <em>Hijaama</em> is performed in the <em>Hijaaz </em>(the western provinces of Saudi Arabia) and in other similar hot countries because the intended aim of extracting blood is achieved with the <em>Hijaama</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for cold countries, the blood seeps into the veins and so the vein needs to be cut by performing venesection (opening/dissecting a vein for bloodletting).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is well known from experience and from observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In cold periods, internally, the body warms up and, externally, it cools down.  So, as similar things attract each other, a cold wind cools down what it meets from bodies and the earth so that the heat which is present escapes from the cold which opposes it, moving to the inside and heating up the inside of the earth.  Similarly, heat escapes the cold and moves to the inner core of animals (’ internal systems) , so animals therefore seek shelter in warmer places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In winter and in cold countries, due to the heat in his body, a person eats more than the one who eats in the summer or in hot countries because body heat helps to digest and utilize food.  Also, underground spring water in winter is warmed due to the warmth of the inside of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In such cases, warm blood is found inside veins and not at the surface of the skin and so in cold weather a  person such as this, having <em>Hijaama</em> performed on them <strong>will not benefit from it, in fact, they could be harmed by it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the summer and in hot countries, the surface warms up and the core cools down.  Therefore, food is not digested in this condition in the way it is digested in the winter.  Also spring water is colder due to the core of the earth being colder, causing animals to go out to the desert and open lands due to the heat of the wind.  So, for people such as these (in warm climates), venesection may not benefit them, rather it could even harm them, and so <em>Hijaama</em> is more beneficial for them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Majmoo’ Fatawa V.17/486 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>B- The Prophet </strong><strong>&#8211;</strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong> <strong>recommended</strong><strong> <em>Hijaama</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From Sumurah bin Jundub who said: I was seated near the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> called for a person to perform <em>Hijaama</em>.  He attached a horn [1] to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and then made an incision with a blade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin from Bani Fazaza came in and said: O Messenger of Allaah what is this person doing cutting your skin?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> answered: ‘This is <em>Hijaama</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: what is <em>Hijaama</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong><span style="color:#000000;">It is the best medicine with which people seek cure</span></strong>.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Nisa’ee and Hakim and it was authenticated by Shaykh Albaani in Silsilah as-Saheehah see v.3  h.1176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From Ibn Abbas, in a narration ascribed to the Prophet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The best days on which to have <em>Hijaama</em> performed are 17<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>. I did not pass a gathering of Angels on the night I was taken on the night journey except that they said: You should have<em>Hijaama</em>, O Muhammad.’</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tirmidhee, al-Hakim, Ahmad and it was declared Hasan by Shaykh Albaani in Silsilah as-Saheehah No. 1847]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Days on which it is recommended to have <em>Hijaama</em> performed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17th, 19th and 21st of every Islaamic month, according to the <em>Hijiri</em> calendar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Huraira who said: The Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Whoever has <em>Hijaama</em> on the 17th, 19th and 21st then it is a cure for every illness.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Daawood and Bayhaaqi and Tabraani see: Silsilah Saheehah No. 908 and Silsilah Daeefah’ No.1863 -1864]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Days on which <em>Hijaama</em> is not recommended and which should be avoided:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Nafi’ who said: Ibn Umar said O Nafi’ I have blood pressure so find me a person who performs <em>Hijaama</em> and, if you can, make sure he is a gentle person.  Do not appoint an old man, nor a young child since I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘It is better to have <em>Hijaama</em> done while on an empty stomach.  <em>Hijaama</em> has a cure and blessings in it and it increases memory and intelligence.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So have the <em>Hijaama</em> performed with the blessings of Allaah on <strong>Thursday</strong> and keep away from <em>Hijaama</em> on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, to be cautious.  Perform <em>Hijaama</em> on Monday and Tuesday since it is the day Allaah pardoned Ayoob <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> from his trial while Allaah imposed the trial on him on a Wednesday.  Neither a skin discolouration disease nor leprosy appear except by performing <em>Hijaama</em> on a Wednesday daytime or a Tuesday night.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Majah, Ibn Adee in ‘al-Kamil’ and Khateeb in ‘al-Faqeeh wa al-Muttafaqih’ and Shaykh Albaani graded it Hasan. See Silsilah Saheehah No.766]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>C – Clarifications</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A brief summary of the clarifications about <em>Hijaama </em>taken from ‘<em>Iblaagh al-fahhaamah bi Fawaaid al-Hajjamaa</em>’ by <strong>Abu Abdul Bari</strong> AbdulHameed bin Ahmad al-Arabi</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">1- It is better not to have <em>Hijaama</em> after having a <strong>bath</strong>, except for the one whose blood is thick then he should take a bath relax for an hour then have <em>Hijaama</em> performed.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">2- It is obligatory that the utensils for <em>Hijaama</em> are clean and sterile so that contagious diseases do not transfer<em>, </em>by Allaah’s permission, from one person to another.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">3- It is better not to have the <em>Hijaama</em> performed 2 or 3 hours prior to <em><strong>Zawwal </strong><br />
</em>(when the sun is at its highest point), except for the one who is in dire need of it, then for that person it is good for him at any time.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">4- You should not have <em>Hijaama</em> done on the <strong>top of the head</strong> except by a person who is very skilled at it, since it is a very sensitive area.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">5- <strong>Older people</strong> should not have <em>Hijaama</em> performed on them often except for the one who has a need.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">6- Doctors dislike <em>Hijaama</em> to be performed on a person who has a <strong>full stomach</strong>, so <em>Hijaama</em> on an empty stomach is better and more beneficial.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[1] In the olden days, a horn used to be attached to suck out the blood, nowadays a plastic suction instrument is used.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.606"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Nations were displayed before me; one or two prophets would pass by along with a few followers. A prophet would pass by accompanied by nobody. Then a big crowd of people passed in front of me and I asked, Who are they Are they my followers?&#8221; It was said, &#8216;No. It is Moses and his followers It was said to me, &#8216;Look at the horizon.&#8221; Behold! There was a multitude of people filling the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#8216;Look there and there about the stretching sky! Behold! There was a multitude filling the horizon,&#8217; It was said to me, &#8216;This is your nation out of whom seventy thousand shall enter Paradise without reckoning.&#8217; &#8220;Then the Prophet entered his house without telling his companions who they (the 70,000) were. So the people started talking about the issue and said, &#8220;It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&#8221; When the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said. &#8220;Those people are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord &#8221; On that &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin said. &#8220;Am I one of them, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

No, (she should observe the prescribed period Idda) for four months and ten days.&#8217;</p>

So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they be given some camels and a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So they set out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their conversion to Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet he sent in their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet ordered that their eyes be branded with heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till they died in that state.</p>

He then said to them, Leave me now,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Call for me the old people of Quraish who emigrated in the year of the Conquest of Mecca.&#8221; I called them and they gave a unanimous opinion saying, &#8220;We advise that you should return with the people and do not take them to that (place) of epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar made an announcement, &#8220;I will ride back to Medina in the morning, so you should do the same.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Are you running away from what Allah had ordained?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Would that someone else had said such a thing, O Abu &#8216;Ubaida! Yes, we are running from what Allah had ordained to what Allah has ordained. Don&#8217;t you agree that if you had camels that went down a valley having two places, one green and the other dry, you would graze them on the green one only if Allah had ordained that, and you would graze them on the dry one only if Allah had ordained that?&#8221; At that time &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, who had been absent because of some job, came and said, &#8220;I have some knowledge about this. I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If you hear about it (an outbreak of plague) in a land, do not go to it; but if plague breaks out in a country where you are staying, do not run away from it.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina.</p>

One of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) started reciting Surat-al-Fatiha and gathering his saliva and spitting it (at the snake-bite). The patient got cured and his people presented the sheep to them, but they said, &#8220;We will not take it unless we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).&#8221; When they asked him, he smiled and said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya?

The patient got cured and the man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, &#8220;You have taken wages for reciting Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; When they arrived at Medina, they said, &#8216; O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near one of the Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, &#8220;Will you go to the group (those travelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something useful?&#8221; They came to them and said, &#8220;O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of you anything useful?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by Allah, we wanted you to receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us something as wages.&#8221; Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha till the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paid them their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Distribute (the sheep).&#8221; But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, &#8220;Do not do that till we go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us.&#8221; So they came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned the story to him and he said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to treat some of his wives by passing his right hand over the place of ailment and used to say, &#8220;O Lord of the people! Remove the difficulty and bring about healing as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing, a healing that will leave no ailment.&#8221;</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.647"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, during his fatal ailment used to blow (on his hands and pass them) over his body while reciting the Mu&#8217;auwidhat (Surat-an-Nas and Surat-al-Falaq). When his disease got aggravated, I used to recite them for him and blow (on his hands) and let him pass his hands over his body because of its blessing. (Ma&#8217;mar asked Ibn Shihab: How did he use to do Nafth? He said: He used to blow on his hands and then pass them over his face.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.648"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once came out to us and said, &#8220;Some nations were displayed before me. A prophet would pass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of people. and another with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I wished that they were my followers, but it was said to me, &#8216;This is Moses and his followers.&#8217; Then it was said to me, &#8216;Look&#8221; I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the horizon. It was said, &#8220;Look this way and that way.&#8217; So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#8220;These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise without (being asked about their) accounts. &#8221; Then the people dispersed and the Prophet did not tell who those 70,000 were. So the companions of the Prophet started talking about that and some of them said, &#8220;As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We think however, that these (70,000) are our offspring.&#8221; That talk reached the Prophet who said, &#8220;These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get treated by branding themselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord.&#8221; then &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am I one of those (70,000)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his verdict about two ladies of the Hudhail tribe who had fought each other and one of them had hit the other with a stone.

The guardian of the lady who was fined said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I be fined for a creature that has neither drunk nor eaten, neither spoke nor cried? A case like that should be nullified.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;This is one of the brothers of soothsayers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Khaibar was conquered, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was presented with a poisoned (roasted) sheep. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Collect for me all the Jews present in this area.&#8221; (When they were gathered) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;I am going to ask you about something; will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Abal-Qasim!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;Who is your father?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Our father is so-and-so.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You have told a lie. for your father is so-and-so,&#8221; They said, &#8220;No doubt, you have said the truth and done the correct thing.&#8221; He again said to them, &#8220;If I ask you about something; will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Abal-Qasim! And if we should tell a lie you will know it as you have known it regarding our father,&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then asked, &#8220;Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We will remain in the (Hell) Fire for a while and then you (Muslims) will replace us in it&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them. &#8221;You will abide in it with ignominy. By Allah, we shall never replace you in it at all.&#8221; Then he asked them again, &#8220;If I ask you something, will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked. &#8220;Have you put the poison in this roasted sheep?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What made you do that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We intended to learn if you were a liar in which case we would be relieved from you, and if you were a prophet then it would not harm you.&#8221;</p>

As for the milk of she-asses, we have learnt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the eating of their meat, but we have not received any information whether drinking of their milk is allowed or forbidden.&#8221; As for the bile of wild animals, Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;Abu Idris Al-Khaulani told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the eating of the flesh of every wild beast having fangs . &#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible to perform ruqyah on a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Rabee (hafidhahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible. Abu Sa&#8217;eed (radhi Allaahu anhu), performed ruqyah on a disbeliever when he went out with a military detachment and passed by a group of people by a well whom they asked permission to be hosted but this group refused to do so. Then when their leader was stung by a scorpion, they came and said: &#8220;Our leader has been stung. Do you have anyone that can treat him with ruqyah?&#8221;  The Companions replied: &#8220;By Allaah, we will not treat him with ruqyah until you give us compensation. We sought your permission but you refused to host us!&#8221; The group gave them a flock of sheep and the leader was treated with Surah Al-Faatihah and cured as if he was freed from shackles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows you that the person who performed ruqyah was sincere. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) concurred with him and with his using Surah Al-Faatihah as a ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, those who perform ruqyah take gifts and money from people even if they do not heal the people they treat!! A condition for the permissibility of taking compensation for ruqyah is that the sick person must be healed, as was the case in the afore-mentioned hadeeth where, upon receiving the ruqyah, the man was cured as if he had just been released from shackles. And as a result of this, the Companions took the flock of sheep as payment. But had the man not been cured, they would not have taken the flock.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, today, the one who performs ruqyah is eager to take money. The sick and unfortunate go to him with their illnesses and misfortunes and they do not receive any help from him yet their money is seized. This money that they take is unlawful, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Posted from <span style="color:#666699;">the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) </span><strong style="color:#666699;"><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong><span style="color:#666699;">, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh , Q&amp;A Session on Ruqya with Shaykh Rabee</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to recommend Talbina for the sick and for one who is grieving over a dead person. She (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to say, &#8220;I heard the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) saying, &#8216;The Talbina gives rest to the heart of the patient and makes it active and relieves some of his sorrow and grief.&#8217; &#8221; [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5689)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that whenever one of her relatives died, the women assembled and then dispersed (returned to their homes) except her relatives and close friends. She (may Allaah be pleased with her) would order that a pot of Talbina be cooked. Then Tharid (a dish prepared from meat and bread) would be prepared and the Talbina would be poured on it. Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) would say (to the women), &#8220;Eat of it, for I heard the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) saying, &#8216;The Talbina soothes the heart of the patient and relieves him from some of his sadness.&#8217; &#8221; [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5690)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hisham&#8217;s father (may Allaah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to recommend Talbina and used to say, &#8216;It is disliked (by the patient) although it is beneficial.&#8217; &#8216; [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5690)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;I encourage you to use that which is disliked but beneficial (Talbina) for by the One whose hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is in, it cleans the stomach of one of you just as dirt is cleaned from the face with water.&#8221; [Mustadrak of Haakim (7455), Saheeh as Dhahabi mentioned in &#8216;Talkhees&#8217; taken from Maktaba Shaamilah, See also Mustadrak (8245) whose chain is upon the condition of Bukhaaree as Dhahabi mentioned].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) narrated, &#8220;If any of the Messenger&#8217;s (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) family became ill, the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) would say, &#8216;It soothes the grieving heart and cleanses the ailing heart just as one of you cleans dirt off his face with water.&#8217; &#8221; [Saheeh Sunan ibn Maajah (3445), hadeeth hasan].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger (Sallallaahu ءlayhi Wasallam) said, &#8220;You should eat the beneficial thing that is unpleasant to eat (Talbina), meaning broth. If any member of the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;s family was sick, the cooking pot would remain on the fire until one of two things happened, either the person recovered or died.&#8221; [Saheeh Sunan ibn Maajah (3446) hadeeth hasan].</p>
