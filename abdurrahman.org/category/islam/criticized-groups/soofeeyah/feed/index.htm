<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#993300;">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</span> )</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you</strong></span>) (15: 99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said: &#8220;Salim said, (This means) death.&#8221;&#8217; This Salim is Salim bin Abdullah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin Abdullah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, &#8220;Death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-Ala&#8217;- one of the women of the Ansar &#8211; that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon Uthman bin Mazun after he had died, Umm Al-Ala&#8217; said, &#8220;<em>May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Saib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How do you know that Allah has honored him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;<em>May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! If not him, then who else</em>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْر»</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(As far as he is concerned, the death has come to him, and I hope for good for him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence that the meaning of this Ayah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you.) is that acts of worship, such as prayer and the like, are obligatory on man so long as his mind is sound, so he should pray according to his best ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;">صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب</span>»</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret <em>Yaqin</em> (the certainty) as <em>Marifah</em> (&#8220;spiritual knowing&#8221;) as some of the <strong>Sufis</strong> do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of <em>Marifah</em>, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets &#8211; peace be upon them &#8211; and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by <em>Yaqin</em> here is death, as we have stated above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Istighaathah </em>is a type of the types of worship, and it is seeking <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Ghauth</em></strong></span> (deliverance or rescue), and it does not occur except at times of adversity or great difficulty, when a person comes to be in a situation of adversity, then he seeks deliverance and rescue from Allaah and he seeks salvation from this adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And <em>al-Istighaathah </em>(seeking rescue and deliverance) is of two types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type is:</strong> <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue) from a created being, with regard to something that no-one is able to do except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and this is <em>shirk</em>. So whoever seeks rescue and deliverance from other than Allaah, whether it be from a <em>jinn</em> or a human or those people who are absent or from the dead, then this is <em>shirk</em> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So seeking rescue and deliverance through the dead and those who are absent from the devils and the <em>jinn</em>, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>shirk</em></strong></span> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is: </strong>seeking aid and rescue from a created being who is present and who is alive with regard to something he is able to do – this is permissible. He the Most High said in the story of Moosaa:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَاسْتَغَاثَهُ الَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى الَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the man who was upon his religion</strong> (i.e. the religion of Moosaa)<strong> he called to him for assistance and rescue against the one who was an enemy </strong></span>[28:15]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 132</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Every Knowledge which worshippers claim to be from hidden inner knowledge (<em>‘Ilmul-Baatin</em>) which is not found in the Book and the Sunnah, then it  is innovation and misguidance. It is not to be acted upon by anyone nor called to </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is what the extreme innovators, amongst them the <em>Baatinees</em> and extreme <em>Soofees</em>, call to. They explain things away by claiming that they have an outer aspect and an inner aspect. They twist the Book of Allah and His <em>Sharee’ah</em> to suit their own desires. Their claim of receiving hidden religious knowledge, outside of the Book and the Sunnah, is disbelief.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 43</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>ومن زعم أنه يرى ربه في دار الدنيا فهو كافر بالله عز وجل</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And whoever claims that he sees his Lord in this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374551685&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-he-saw-his-lord-in-this-world-then-he-is-a-disbeliever-in-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever claims that anyone can see Allaah in this world, seeing Him with their eyes not seeing Him in a dream then he is a disbeliever; <em>kaafir</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High cannot be seen in this world and therefore when <em>kaleemullaah</em>, the one to whom Allaah spoke, Moosa <em>alayhissalam</em>:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِي أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَٰكِنِ انظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي</p>
<p>لَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Moosaa (`<em>alayhissalaam</em>) said, “Oh my Lord, show Yourself to me so that I may look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me, however look at the mountain and if it remains settled at its place then you will see Me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one can see Allaah in this world (<em>dunya)</em>. This is a point of consensus (<em>ijmaa)</em> amongst the scholars. Rather, seeing Allaah will be in the Hereafter because the people in this world are weak, they are not able to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because of their weakness and therefore when Allaah manifested Himself to the mountain, it shattered and became dust. So, how about the son of Aadam who is made of flesh and blood?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for in the Hereafter, Allaah will give to the believers strength through which they will be able to see Allaah and they will delight in seeing Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, seeing Allaah in the Hereafter is established and is <em>mutawaatir</em> (quoted by a huge number of people at each level of transmission) is established for the believers. But as for in this world then no one will see Allaah with His eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disagree whether the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw Him on the night of the ascent through the Heavens or did not see Him. And what is correct or the great majority are upon is that the Messenger did not see Him with His eye but rather, he saw Him with his heart and with his insight because no one can see Allaah in this life, because Allah is greater than that anyone should see Him in this life and therefore when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Did you see your Lord on the night of the ascent (mi`raaj), ascent through the Heavens?” He said, “Noorun Anna Araahu.” (Light, how could I see Him?) ”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim <u>h</u>adeeth no. (178) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> that the Prophet responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Light, how could I see Him?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“His screen is light, if He were to uncover it then the shining light of His face would consume whatever his gaze came upon from His creation.</strong>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>H</u>adeeth also reported by Muslim (179) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author,  &#8216;<em>Whoever claims that he can see His Lord in the life of this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;</em>.  I say, this claim has been claimed by many of the <strong>heretic <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who say that they see their Lord and they see the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and take from him and take from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic directly and they believe that they are in a station higher than the station of Messengership and whoever claims this claim then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). There is no doubt about his disbelief and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> likewise mentions the same point that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the claim of the <strong>extreme <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who claim that they can take knowledge directly from Allaah, the Most High by way of Kashf and who claim that they can obtain knowledge of the hidden and unseen (<em>ghaib)</em> directly from Allaah, the Most High, this point refers to the like of them and that claim is disbelief.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 1304</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner would like to be given a general idea about the Qadiriyyah Tariqah (Sufi order). He read one of the Qadiriyyah books: <em>&#8220;Al-Fiyudat Al-Rabbaniyyah fi Al-Ma&#8217;athir wa Al-Awrad Al-Qadiriyyah&#8221;</em>, and saw a poem including some of the claims and feats performed by the shaykh of this Tariqah. He asks if what is said in this poem is true or untrue. The questioner sent the poem along with his question to ask for a general Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The poem that was sent by the questioner shows that the one who wrote it was ignorant, as the things that he ascribes to himself are Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. He claims that all the scholars&#8217; knowledge has been derived from his knowledge and is part of him. He also claims that the Servants&#8217; behavior is according to what he legislates for them and that he would be able to close the Fire due to his greatness, except for a prior pledge taken from the Prophet. He says he can help those of his Murid (students) who are loyal to him and save them from ordeals, protect them in this world and in the Hereafter, secure them from fear, and be with them at the Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are false claims, and could only be said by someone who is ignorant and does not know his own ability. Comprehensive knowledge is possessed by Allah Alone, as are the matters related to the Hereafter, and He Alone has control over them; not an angel, a prophet, or a pious person. Allah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His Creation, to recite to the Ummah (nation) His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8220;It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;None can protect me from Allâh’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) told those closest to him to save themselves and their children from Allah&#8217;s Punishment through having Iman (Faith) in Him (Glorified be He) and by acting according to His Shari`ah (laws). He also told them that Allah is not in need of them and that Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham) and `Isa (Jesus) will be saying on the Day of Resurrection, &#8220;Myself, myself!&#8221; So how can a shaykh of the Qadiriyyah Tariqah or anyone else created by Allah save their followers, protect those who are loyal to them, and come with them when their deeds are being weighed on the Day of Resurrection? And how could he close the gates of Hell by his greatness? <strong>This is a manifest fabrication and clear Kufr regarding the Shari`ah of the Lord of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of this poem has been excessive in his exaggeration and has overstepped the boundaries of the senses,the intellect, and the Shari`ah, when he claims that he was in the light of Muhammad before the existence of creation, and that he witnessed the meeting of friends, i.e. when Jibril (Gabriel) met with Muhammad (peace be upon them both); he was with Nuh (peace be upon him) in the ark and witnessed the flood; he was with Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he was thrown to the fire and saw how the fire cooled due to his Du`a&#8217; (supplication); he was with Isma`il (Ishmael) and that the ram was only sent except by his generosity; he was with Ya`qub (Jacob, peace be upon him) when his sight was taken away and that his eyes were only cured with his spit; he was the one who settled Idris (Enoch, peace be upon him) in Jannah (Paradise); he was with Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) when he talked to his Lord and that Musa&#8217;s stick was taken from his stick; he was with `Isa (peace be upon him) in the cradle; and that it was he who gave Dawud (David) his beautiful voice for recitation. He also makes even more obscene claims than these, as he claims that he is Allah in three verses of his poem, the clearest of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am the one, the only, and the great one in himself,<br />
I am the describer and the described; the shaykh of the Tariqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah be Exalted and Glorified from this great exceeding of the bounds; <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">is there anything worse than this sheer Kufr?</span> </strong>May Allah protect us from it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Dear questioner, may Allah turn you away from this evil you heard and make you feel no need to study the detailed history and biography of the Qadiriyyah, and what is in this poem by the shaykh of this Tariqah in terms of falsehood, Kufr, and exaggeration. Exert yourself instead to learn the truth from the Book of Allah(Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and the explanations of the Salaf (pious predecessors) from among the Sahabah (Companions) and their followers of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah. We believe that <strong>Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany</strong>, to whom this Tariqah is ascribed, is as innocent of what is in this poem as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Yaqub&#8217;s son. His followers tell many lies about him and ascribe to him that which he is innocent of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> narrate from some of the righteous people that they said: ‘That people worship Allaah, and as for the<em>Soofeeyah</em> then they worship their own selves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Swallat Ibn al-Qayyim li Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah’ P.269 &amp; ‘Madarij Salikeen’ 1/260]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how good is what Abu Ahmad ash-Shayrazi said: ‘The <em>Soofeeyah</em> used to ridicule Shaytaan and now the Shaytaan ridicules them! !’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.241]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>The Deception of the Shaytaan of the Soofeeyah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>comments on the statement of<em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> when he spoke about the deception of the Shaytaan of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, when he <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaytaan caused them to buzz around (dance) and to beat/strike the ground whizzing around on their feet, then sometimes he makes them like donkeys going around a pivot, and sometimes like insects dancing  in the middle of the house…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh (Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah</em>) intends the <em>Mutasawwafa</em> (<em>Soofeeyah</em>) who form into circles, then stand up in those circles and dance and swing from side to side to the tune of singing and musical instruments.  They shout, scream and dance together with what they call <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.409]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that Whistling and Clapping is Prayer</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> speaks about the <em>Ayaah</em> &lt;&lt; Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.  Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee commented on this by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the <em>Soofeeyah</em> of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is far from this.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.440]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>The Soofeeyah’s Dislike of Knowledge</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> quoted:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn Baakwaya said: ‘One day Abu Abdullaah bin Khaffeef saw Ibn Maktoom and his group and they were writing something, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are writing such and such.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Busy yourselves by learning something and do not be deceived by the speech of the<em>Soofeeyah</em>.  I used to hide my pen in the pocket of my rags and the paper in the pocket of my garment and I would go in hiding to the people of knowledge, if they (the<em>Soofeeyah</em>) found out I was there they would dispute with me and say: you will not be successful, but then eventually they were in need of me (this knowledge).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imam</em> ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This Shaykh had combined between knowledge and action and getting chains of narrations (Ahadeeth) from their sources, and would adhere to the <em>Sunnan</em> with a long enjoyable life in obedience to Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 16/346 &#8211; 347]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> quoted Ghazali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ghazali said: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> have taken to inspirational knowledge and not proper learnt knowledge, so one of them sits with his heart being empty, with total concern he says: ‘Allaah, Allaah, Allaah’ continuously so that his heart becomes empty. The <em>Soofeeyah</em> do not busy themselves with recitation of Qur’aan, nor with the books of Hadeeth.  So if the <em>Soofi</em>reaches this limit, then he stays in his house alone in the darkness and in a garment wrapped up, then at that time he hears the call of truth: &lt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muddathir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O you wrapped in garments (Prophet Muhammad)! &gt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muzzammil]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ad-Dhahabi (d.748) commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The leader of creation indeed heard &lt;&gt; [Surah Al-Muddathir] from Jibraeel from Allaah. As for this idiot, then he never heard the call of truth, rather he heard the Shaytaan, or he heard it from his fickled brain and did not hear it in reality, and success is adhering to the Sunnah and <em>al-Ijmaa’</em>(consensus).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 19/322-346]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A Rich Thankful Person and a Needy Patient Person who is Better?</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> after discussing the issue of: ‘The difference amongst the people about a rich thankful person and a needy patient person who is better?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The definition of <em>al-Faqar</em> (poverty – needy) according to many of the people, had become such that they regarded: <em>al-Faqar</em> to be <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners. They labeled the one described with <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners as a <em>Faqeer</em> (needy person) even though he possessed wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said about the one who is not described with <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners as not a <em>Faqeer</em> (needy person) even if he does not possess wealth, and perhaps it is possible that this meaning can be called <em>Tasawwuf</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people there are those who differentiate between the title <em>al-Faqeer</em>(needy person) and <em>as-Soofi</em>, then there are from these people who regard the term <em>al-Faqeer</em> better, and from them are those people who hold the view that the title <em>as-Soofi</em>is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Research into this issue shows that one should not look at innovated words, but one should look at what the Book and the Sunnah brought from words and meanings, indeed Allaah gave the description of His <em>Aawliya</em> which is that of <em>al-Eemaan</em> and <em>at-Taqwa</em> so whoever has a greater portion is better and the rich people are equivalent in regard to this, and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Udaatus Sabireen’ p.293]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Ibn al-Qayyim’s Refutation Against the Soofeeyah in their Rejection of Knowledge</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for what is narrated about some of them [i.e. the <em>Soofeeyah</em>] in that they regard knowledge as insignificant and them being in no need of knowledge, then that is like the one [<em>Soofee</em>] who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We take our knowledge directly from the living One, who does not die, as for you then you take it from one who lives and then dies [i.e. narrators of hadeeth].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one said when he was asked: ‘Why don’t you travel so that you can hear hadeeth from AbdurRazzaq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘What can I do with narrating from AbdurRazzaq, when someone hears directly from the Creator?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one [<em>Soofee</em>] said: ‘Knowledge is a veil between the heart and between Allaah – Azza wa Jal – [i.e. Prevents you from reaching Allaah].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another said: ‘If you see a <em>Soofee</em> busying himself with ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’ (he narrated to us) [These terms are used in narrating hadeeth] then wash your hands from him [i.e. keep away from him].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one said: ‘We have knowledge from numerical codes and you have knowledge from papers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> comments on their statements by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the conditions of those who say these statements and other similar statements is that he is an ignoramus who can be excused for his ignorance. Or a negligent person who acknowledges his negligence, or otherwise if it was not for AbdurRazzaq and the likes of him [scholars of hadeeth], and if it was not for ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’ (he narrated to us) then nothing of Islaam would have reached this person and those similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever directs you to other than ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’(he narrated to us) then he has directed you to either, <em>Soofee</em> fiction, or philosophical analogy, or to his own personal opinion.  There is nothing after the Qur’aan or ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’(he narrated to us) except the doubts of the people of theological rhetoric and the opinions of the deviant people, and the imaginations of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, and analogies of the philosophers. Whoever separates himself from the evidences then he becomes misguided away from the correct path, there is no evidence to lead to Allaah and Paradise except the Book and the Sunnah.  Every path which is not accompanied with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah is from the path of Hell and the Shaytaan <em>nirajeem</em> (accursed Shaytaan).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Madarij   vol.2 p.438-439]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muhammad bin Idrees Sha’fiee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> (d.204 A.H.) said in a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قال الشافعي رحمه الله<br />
كل العلوم سوى القرآن مشغلة                            إلا الحديث وعلم الفقه والدين<br />
العلم ما كان فيه قال حدثنا                                                                     وما سوى ذلك وساوس الشياطين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every knowledge other than the Qur’aan is a distraction *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except the hadeeth and the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> of the <em>Deen</em> *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is that which has ‘He said’ ‘he narrated to us’ *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything other than that is whisperings of <em>Shayateen</em> *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Dewaan ash-Sha’fiee’ (p.124), ‘Bidayya wa Nihiyya’ (10/254)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that follow <strong>Muhammad Ilyaas</strong>, the founder of this Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A biography of the founder:</strong></span> Muhammad Ilyaas was born in 1302H. He memorized the Qur’aan and read the Six Collections of Hadeeth. [2] He was upon the Deobandi methodology, taking the Hanafee madh-hab, the Ash’aree and Matureedee Creed and the Sufi way. They have four Sufi orders amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Naqshabandees<br />
2. The Sahroordees<br />
3. The Qaadirees, and<br />
4. The Jishtees</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyaas gave the Sufi bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to <strong>Shaikh Rasheed Al-Kankoohee, </strong>who later became<strong> Shaikh Rasheed As-Saharanpuree</strong>. Then he renewed it with Shaikh Ahmad As-Saharanpuree who certified him to take oaths of allegiance. Muhammad Ilyaas would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee, in what is known as the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation). And he would go out to the grave of ‘Abdul-Qudoos Al-Kankoohee, the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood [3] on him. He resided and taught in Delhi and passed away in 1363H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Circumstances that brought about the start of the movement:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Abul-Hasan An-Nadwee saw that Muhammad Ilyaas took refuge in this way of giving Da’wah when the ways of blind-following failed to rectify the people of his region. Shaikh Miyaan Muhammad Aslam quotes one of Ilyaas’ sayings that he received kashf (mystic disclosure) to follow this way through a dream in which he was inspired with a new tafseer (interpretation) of Allaah’s saying: <b>“You were the best nation brought out for mankind, commanding good and forbidding evil and believing in Allaah.”</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] And it was that going out (khurooj) to call people to the way of Allaah cannot be realized by staying in one place based on Allaah’s word <b>“brought out”</b> and that one’s Eemaan increases by going out in this khurooj based on Allaah’s saying: <b>“and believing in Allaah”</b> after having said:<b>“brought out for mankind.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The following can be noted from what has just been mentioned:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Qur’aan is not interpreted by makshoofaat (mystical disclosures), and by Sufi dreams, of which the majority of them, rather all of them come from the inspirations of the Devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is apparent from what was stated previously that the founder of this Jamaa’ah was engrossed in Sufism from head to toe. This is because he gave two oaths of allegiance on it and was tested by its false beliefs and because he would spend his time sitting by the graves of Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a <strong>qubooree</strong> (grave worshipper) and a <strong>khuraafee</strong>. This is clear from his saying: “…and he would sit in detached isolation (<strong>khalwah</strong>) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee.” And concerning the second person, he mentioned that he forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him. So his being attached to the grave of the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him is without doubt a clear proof that he held that same belief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Those who believe in <strong>wahdat-ul-wujood</strong> claim that Allaah embodies Himself inside the attractive woman – and refuge is sought from Allaah! This is a matter that has reached the highest level of repulsiveness. May Allaah give them what they deserve of His curses and wrath!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The methodology of the Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh can be summarized in six issues or six principles or six characteristics:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Actualizing the statement of Tawheed: <i>“Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah”</i> (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and Muhammad is His Messenger)<br />
2. Praying with full submissiveness and humility<br />
3. Knowledge of the Virtues (<i>Fadaa’il</i>) and not the Fiqh issues (<i>Masaa’il</i>) along with knowledge of dhikr<br />
4. Showing generosity to the Muslim<br />
5. Correcting the intention<br />
6. Calling to Allaah (i.e. Da’wah) and going out (i.e. khurooj) for that purpose in the Way of Allaah upon the tablighi manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an objective behind each of these six principles or characteristics as well as a virtue to be attained. So for example the objective behind (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>) is to: “Eradicate the corrupted yaqeen (Certainty) from the heart while placing the correct and valid yaqeen into the Essence (dhaat) of Allaah.” They really intend the belief of wahdat-ul-wujood with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Point to be noted about Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was raised upon Sufism and gave two oaths of allegiance on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He would position himself by graves, waiting to receive <strong>Kashf</strong> (Sufi mystical disclosure) and meditative ideas from the deceased inside them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He would perform the <strong>Jishtee Muraaqabah</strong> (self meditation) at the gravesite of ‘Abdul-Quddoos Al-Kankoohee, who used to believe in wahadat-ul-wujood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Jishtee Muraaqabah is to sit by a grave for half an hour of every week, covering the face and reciting this dhikr: “<em>Allaahu Haadiree, Allaahu Naadhiree</em>.” [4] This statement or this action if done sincerely for Allaah is an innovation. And if it is done for the person in the grave then it is committing Shirk with Allaah. And the last of the two is what is most evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They have four of their graves located in the masjid from where their Da’wah emerged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The founder of this Jamaa’ah believed in Kashf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a grave worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The Tablighis perform their worship with an innovated form of dhikr, done in the way of the Sufis. This is by splitting up the statement of Tawhheed (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Whoever cuts off the negation part of the Statement of Tawheed from its affirmation part intentionally, by saying “Laa Ilaaha” (only), then this necessitates the fact that he has committed disbelief. Shaikh Hamood At-Tuwayjiree stated this, quoting it from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They make it permissible to wear amulets that have on them mystical writings and names of unknown people, which probably are names of devils! And this is not permissible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience due to anyone in disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 180 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience to mankind in disobedience to Allaah, indeed obedience is in goodness.</strong>&#8220;[Silsilah Saheehah: 181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The reason for this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched an army, and he commanded a man to lead them, who lit a fire, and the man said to the army: enter into the fire. The people wanted to enter into the fire, but some of them said : verily we have just fled from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he said to those who wanted to enter into it: if you entered it you would have remained in it until the Day of Judgment, and he said a good word to the others, and he said…..(the above hadeeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The extra wording in the hadeeth is from Tayyalisee and the context is by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by him where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched a battalion and ordered a man from the Ansaar to lead them, and he ordered them to listen to him and obey him. They caused this man to get angry, so he said to them: Gather some firewood for me, so they gathered it for him. Then he said: light the fire and they lit the fire, then he said to them: Did not the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – order you to listen and to obey me? They said Yes, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said &#8211; enter in to the fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they started to look at each other, and said (and in another narration: a young boy said to them) : indeed we fled to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from the fire, [ do not be hasty, until you meet the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and if he orders you to enter it, then enter into it ], so this is what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man&#8217;s anger came down/subsided, and the fire was put out. When they returned to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and mentioned it to him, he said: if you had entered it, you would never have exited from it, <strong>indeed obedience is in goodness</strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari (8/47, 13/109), Muslim (6/16), Ahmad (1/82, 134) and other narrations which contain the extra wording is also by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has many benefits, the most important of which is the impermissibility of obedience to anyone, if it is disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala, whether it is the leaders, scholars and the shaykhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this hadeeth you get to know the misguidance of different groups of people;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> some of the soofis who obey their shaykhs, even if they command them to commit sins, using as a proof, that they in reality are not committing sins. Also that the shaykh sees that which the follower does not see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know a shaykh from amongst these people who appointed himself as a leader. He mentioned a story to his followers in some of his lessons in the masjid, the summary of which is, one of the Soofi shaykhs ordered one of his followers that during the night he should go to his father and kill him while he is in his bed next to his wife! So when he killed him, he returned to the shaykh, happily having carried out the command of the shaykh! The shaykh looked at him and said: Do you think that you have really killed your father? Rather he is your mother&#8217;s boyfriend! As for your father he is away!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he makes and presents a Sharia&#8217; ruling, as he claims, from his story, and he says to his followers : If a shaykh orders his follower with a ruling which is apparently against the Sharia&#8217;, it is upon the followers to obey him in this, then he said: Do you not see this shaykh, he apparently orders the boy to kill his father, however in reality he ordered him to kill the one who fornicated with his mother, and that person deserved to be killed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The falsity of this story is not hidden according to the Sharia&#8217; from many angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: Carrying out the punishment is not the right of the shaykh, no matter how important he is; rather it is from the right of the leader or the one in charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong> </span>: if the case was that this actually took place, then why did he only carry out the punishment on the man and not the woman, and they both fornicated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: the Sharia&#8217; ruling for the married adulterer is to be stoned to death, and the person is not killed except by stoning. From this it is clear that the shaykh has opposed the Sharia&#8217; from many angles, this is also the situation with the follower who based upon this previous story, made it incumbent upon the Muslims to be obedient to the shaykh, to the extent one of them said to the people: if you see the shaykh and he is wearing a cross around his neck, then it is not allowed to criticize him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With all the clarity of the absurdity of these stories, and their opposition together to the Sharia&#8217; and to the intellect, we find some people become deceived by these stories, and amongst them some of the cultured youth. A discussion took place between me and one of those youths about that story, and he had heard it from that follower of the shaykh, and what the shaykh had based his ruling upon. However, the discussion with him did not bring about any benefit. He persisted in believing this story, since according to his claim, it was a miracle, and he added: you people reject miracles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I said to him: If your shaykh orders you to kill your father, would you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Indeed, I have not reached that level yet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after this can anyone be blamed for characterizing the religion of these shaykhs except that they are the opium of the people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second group is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blind followers who prefer to follow the statements of the Madhab above the statement of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam with what is clearly taken from the statements of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. So if it is said to one of them, for example: <strong>do not pray the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer after the obligatory prayer has begun</strong>, due to the prohibition of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from doing so, which is clear, they do not obey, and they say the Madhab allows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said to them: <strong>the Nikah at-Tahleel</strong> ( whereby another man marries the divorced woman and then divorces so that she can be allowed to marry her first husband) is invalid, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – cursed the one who does this. They would answer by saying: No, but it is permissible according to such and such Madhab!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are hundreds of issues like this, and this is why many of the scholars held the opinion that the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala about the Christians: &lt;&lt; <strong>They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah</strong> &gt;&gt; applies to these blind followers, as Fahkr ar-Razi has explained in his Tafseer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Soofis like to link the name to <strong>Ahlus-Suffah</strong> (people of As-Suffah) who were at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that there are great resemblances between the Soofee adept and Ahlu-Suffa. Those were poor people from the Muhaajireen who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah fleeing the persecution of the pagan Arabs. They were driven away from their homes and had neither money nor families, nor a place to stay. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) assisted them and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) allowed them to stay in a courtyard by his Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact, however, is that those poor Muslims resorted to the Mosque <strong>out of necessity</strong>. Their numbers increased at certain times and decreased at other times. Some of them stayed longer than others. So they were not a specific group united on something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soofism in its early stages stressed the concepts of <strong>detachment from the worldly life, poverty, isolation</strong>, etc. <span style="color:#993300;">The people of As-Suffah did not choose such concepts</span>. They were in need and the Muslims helped them. They did not isolate themselves. In fact, they <strong>engaged in Jihaad</strong> whenever it was announced. When Allaah, the Most High, bestowed from His bounties upon the Muslims, <strong>some of them became free of want and were among the richest of the Sahaabah</strong> and others became <strong>leaders in some Muslim lands</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Soofis would like to establish a linkage with the Prophet’s era and claim as well that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) approved the early seed of Soofism exemplified in Ahlus-Suffah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, and from a linguistic point of view, to derive Soofism from As-Suffah is wrong, because the correct term would be <strong>Suffism</strong> and not Soofism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Posted from e-Book</strong> : <a title="Sufism : Origin and Development  – Dr. Saleh As-Saleh" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/04/12/sufism-origin-and-development-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Sufism : Origin and Development</a>  – Dr. Saleh As-Saleh</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim believes that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and the last Prophet. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last of the Prophets</span>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah entrusted Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with the final and complete message of Islam, calling mankind to worship none but Allaah. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the best of the Messengers and the best of mankind. He, has no share at all of Ruboobiyyah (lordship) nor any share of Divinity. Contemplate the saying of Allaah regarding Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say, O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not within my power to bring benefit nor to keep away harm except as Allaah wills; and if I knew what the future holds I could amass a great deal of wealth and harm would not befall me. But I am just a Messenger from Allaah sent by Him to warn those who disobey Him of His punishment, and to give glad tidings of His reward fro those who truly believe in Him and are obedient to Him.</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf, 7:188].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I am just a human like yourselves, I forget just as you forget. So, if I forget, then remind me.</span>” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The belief that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah necessitates that</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the true Messenger of Allaah; he did not lie nor was he belied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The Muslim should follow his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-The Muslim believes in all of the reports which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) related regarding the past, present and future and that these reports were revealed to him by Allaah (Azza wa Jal) and was not something which he knew on his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4-We comply with his commands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5-We stay away from what he forbade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-We defend the Sharee’ah with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7-We comply with all that the he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought from the Sharee’ah as if it were from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In the sight of the mystic Soofis,</strong></span> the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is looked upon in ways that oppose the path which Allaah (Azza wa Jal) intended for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be summarized in the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Many Soofis stress the concept of what they call <strong>Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong> or the <strong>“Perfect Man” (Al- Insaan Al-Kaamil)</strong>. In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation. And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “Perfect Man” or the “Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al-Jeeli (d.820Hj/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. [29] In this book he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, may Allaah guard and protect you, that Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man) is the Qutub (the axis) around which the spheres of existence from beginning to end revolves. And he is one since the being of existence and forever and ever. Furthermore, he takes on various forms and appears in churches&#8230;his original name which belongs to him is Muhammad&#8230;I met him while he was in the image of my sheikh Sharaf-ud-Deen Ismaa’eel Al- Jhubratee&#8230;the secret behind this matter is him being able to take the form of every image&#8230;” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the same creed of Ibn ‘Arabi and the advocates of <strong>Wahdat Al-Wujud</strong>, those who claim that Allaah is the essence of all that exits. They consider the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as the first created being and from him originated rest of creation and that he himself is the God who is above the Throne. Such concept is similar to the philosophical concept of the “<strong>first cause</strong>” or the “<strong>first active intellect</strong>” from whom the creation emanated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-Some Soofis hold to the same concept as above but do not say that the essence of Muhammad is above the ‘Arsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-Many Soofis claim that <strong>the light of Muhammad</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the first being, and that he is the most honorable of creation, and for his sake Allaah has created the universe. They do not explicitly say that the creatures originated from him. [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most Soofis, however, concur that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the <strong>essence of emanation of all knowledge</strong>. Some of them consider that this emanation is eternal, meaning that it is present even before the existence of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). That is why a large sector of the Soofis believe that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) <strong>knows the Ghayb</strong> and that nothing escapes his knowledge in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have also innovated many practices aimed at showing their so-called love of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) including <strong>celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday</strong> and his journey of <strong>Israa’ and Mi’raaj</strong>, his <strong>Hadrah</strong>, [32] and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They even <strong>call upon the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) seeking aid and help believing that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) responds and answers such Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such concepts, beliefs, and practices concerning the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) are corrupt and contradict the Message of the Qur’aan and Sunnah as well as the way of the true believers, the Sahaabah and those who followed them on the path of righteousness, may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Part-Concepts and Practices of Soofism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(A) In Reference to Tawheed of Allaah, the Most High.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed) means to single out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of affairs, with all worship, and with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself or upon the tongue of His Messenger and as they befit His Magnificence. The proof of this is in many texts from the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. One of them is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">[Allaah is] the Rabb of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, Ar-Rahmaan (the one whose Mercy encompasses everything), so worship him alone and be patient and firm on his worship, do you know of any who is similar to Him?</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam, 19:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Tawheed centers upon three types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-<strong>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Tawheed of Lordship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of Affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-<strong>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Tawheed of Worship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with all worship such that no kind of worship could be offered to anyone or anything besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-<strong>Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat:</strong> Singling out Allaah with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself in His Book, or upon the tongue of His Messenger. So the believer affirms what Allaah has affirmed for Himself, and denying whatever He has denied from Himself, without Tahreef (changing and distorting their meanings), without Ta’teel (denying or divesting Allaah of His Attributes), without Takyeef (describing how they are), and without Tamtheel (likening them to those of His creation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">This true belief in Tawheed is not the “Tawheed” of the foremost Soofis. Their Tawheed reflects different creeds and is considered by many as “hidden knowledge” which may be only attained by the elite:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>01 &#8211; Al-Hulool:[13] In mystic Soofism it refers to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Divine incarnation</span> in the so-called Soofee saints.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn Taymeeyah classified the <strong>Hulool</strong> into two kinds. The first is the specific hulool like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eessa (alayhi assaalm) and like that of the extremist Shee’ah and Soofee mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (radhi Allahu anhu) and in special Soofee saints, respectively. The second kind is the general Hulool and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [14] <span id="more-34648"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the most daring Soofis who held to the concept of incarnation was <strong>Al-Hallaaj</strong> [15] who was tried for his heresy and put to death by the ‘Abbaasid authorities. Ibn ‘Ajeebah (1224 AH/1809 C.E.), one of the leading Soofis who explained the Hikam of the mystic Ibn ‘Ataa (d. 709AH/1309 C.E.) related that Al-Hallaj said: “<em>I am You without doubt Subhaanak is Subhaanee. Your Tawheed is my Tawheed and disobeying You is disobeying me. Glorified be He whom his Naassoot (creation, human qualities) made manifest the secret of His shining and piercing Laahoot (the Divine)</em>.[16] He then appeared in His creation manifested in the image of the one who eats and drinks. Even His creation was able to see Him with their own eyes like the moment an eyebrow sees an eyebrow [emphasizing certitude].” [17] Ibn ‘Ajeebah added, “And because of the unraveling of such matters and other similar ones, Al-Hallaaj, may Allaah be pleased with him! -was killed.”[18] These matters according to Ibn ‘Ajeebah and other mystics should not be disclosed. They are the secrets of their Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>02 &#8211; Some see Allaah as the only existing being. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is stressed by <strong>Al-Ghazaalee</strong>, may Allaah forgive him, in his book <strong>Ihyaa ‘Ulum ad-Deen</strong>. He said: “<em>Anyone who does not see Allaah in everything, then he sees ‘other’ than Him,</em>” and that “<em>The pure Tawheed is to see in everything nothing but Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala.</em>” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of such “Tawheed” is that there is one existing being and that is Allaah. The one who sees an existence other than that of Allaah is the Mushrik (who commits Shirk). Al-Ghazaalee explained the perfect understanding of la ilaaha illa Allaah as: “To see none except the One, the Truth,&#8221; and that this represents the “perfect state of Tawheed!” He referred to a state of “Tawheed,” “witnessed by the sincere ones and which the Soofis call Al-Fanaa’ (annihilation) in Tawheed” as the one in which, “Only One (i.e. Allaah) is seen in the entire existence.” Al- Ghazaalee stresses that the utmost objective of Tawheed is to see, “Al-Kull (everything) not as Katheer (many), but as one,” and that this “represents the objective of the (Soofee) knowledge known as Kashf,” and that, “The secrets of this knowledge should not be recorded in a book.” He defined the Mushrik as the one, “Who affirms the existence of ‘an existence’ besides that of Allaah” and that Allaah is, “The witness and the Witnessed, the one loving dearly and the Beloved, and He is the Shaakir (the one who is thankful) and the Mashkoor (The One Who deserves acknowledgment and recognition)…”[20] This is not true Tawheed in which the believer knows well that Allaah is distinct and separate from His creation, rather this is “Wahdah” (unity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Doctrine of Wahdat Al-Wujud.</strong></span> This is neither <strong>Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in creation) nor <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created), rather it means that every creature that the eye sees is Allaah in essence. This concept of the Unity of Existence is held by many of the so-called Soofee saints (Awliyaa’) like Ibn Al-Faarid (d. 632AH/1235 C.E.), Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 638AH/1240 C.E.), Ibn ‘Sab’een (d. 669 AH/1270 C.E.), Al-‘Afeef At-Tilmisaani (d. 690 AH/1291C.E.), Ibn Masheesh (d. 622 AH/1225 C.E.), An- Nabulusi (d. 1143 AH/1731 C.E.), and others. Under such concept, the presence of creation is an illusion or an imagination. Many Soofis consider Ibn ‘Arabi the Greatest sheikh and the symbol of the concept of Wahdat Al-Wujud. He considers the Soofee who knows of Allaah (‘Aarif billaah) as the one who “Sees Allaah in everything, rather he sees Him the essence of Everything,” [21] and that “He (Allaah) is the Essence of Existence” [22] Ibn ‘Arabi considered all kinds creeds to be true and he believed in them all. This is his “Unity of Worship”: Creatures have held [certain] tenets regarding the Ilaah And I have believed in all of what they have believed in.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “Be careful not to restrict yourself to a particular (or distinct) creed and deny everything else otherwise you would miss a great deal of good. Rather you would miss knowing the matter as it is. So, be within yourself an HexhqKy (Hayouli: A substance) for all the forms of creeds, for Allaah is Greater than being limited by one creed and excluding another.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ibn ‘Arabi contain many statements in which he considers everything worshipped on earth is Allaah [25] and that his heart “turned to accept every image”; it became “a monastery for monks, a home for idols, the Ka’bah of the Taa’if (the one in Tawaaf), the Tablets of the Torah, and the book of the Qur’aan&#8230;” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is only a very brief presentation on the position of mystic Soofism regarding the belief in Allaah Who is High above what they attribute to Him. Imaam Ath-Thahabee rahimahullah said regarding the book of Fusoos Al-Hikam of Ibn ‘Arabi: “If there is no Kufr in it [Fusoos], then there is no Kufr in this world!” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Hulool: lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Second Part: When Did It All Start? [9]<br />
<strong>The Beginning and Development of Soofism</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Innovations usually start small then grow big</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars traced the seeds of Soofism to the early stages of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>second Century of the Hijri calendar</strong></span>, while others pointed out that the early features of it began before the year 200 After Hijrah (AH).10 The early deviation was exemplified in <strong>exaggerations in worship</strong> and <strong>extremism in avoidance of the worldly life</strong>. In the beginning, some people became interested in leading a pious life of Zuhd (an abstemious way of life), patience, clemency, sincerity, truthfulness, although some of them exaggerated and (or) introduced innovated forms of worship and innovated concepts. Then those who attached themselves to such practices became lax in allowing <strong>singing and dancing</strong>, something which they refer to as <strong>Samaa’</strong> [singing aimed at stimulating a state of <strong>Wajd (ecstasy)</strong> and excessive worship.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As, with every Bid’ah, Iblees beautifies it in the eyes of its beholder and drives him to do more Bida’. The Soofism is just one case of Talbees Iblees (A devil’s deception), whereby he turned them away from knowledge and showed them that what matters is action. Though many of them may have started with good intentions, nevertheless they took off from the course of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During of the third century</strong></span>, introduction of new concepts and practices became more evident. Some became interested in <strong>monasticism (living like monks)</strong>, while others spoke of <strong>poverty, hunger, sleeplessness, wonderment, seclusions, dancing, clamping, innovated forms of Thikr</strong>, etc. Many <strong>abandoned marriage and the seeking of means of sustenance</strong>. Others exaggerated in disassociating themselves from Hadeeth and its knowledge. In the course of this development, the masters would put certain regulations that made them see themselves as the “special” who have “special inward knowledge” that takes the person directly to Allaah. They referred to this state as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-&#8216;Ilm Al-Baatin (special &#8220;inward&#8221; knowledge)</strong></span>. Such baseless classifications marked the beginning of the introduction of the so-called <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;knowledge of Al-Haqeeqah (lit. Reality)</span></strong>, in reference to the so-called &#8220;<strong>mystic knowledge</strong>&#8221; of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>By the end of this century</strong></span>, Soofism spread and Soofee orders began to sprout and some of its deviant creeds like <strong>Al- Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in incarnation), <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created) were adopted by some of their extreme masters. New states of Soofism were defined and the masters spoke of specific terminology defining such states, like <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Fanaa</strong></span>’ (annihilation), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thawq</strong> </span>(experience), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kashf</strong> </span>(perception and witnessing all of the realities of existence as well as those of the unseen), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wajd</strong> </span>(ecstasy), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Samaa</strong></span>&#8216; (mystic singing and dancing as a means of inspiration), and other philosophical terms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During the 4th century</strong></span>, Soofism was almost transformed into orders accommodating all sorts of Bida’ in ‘Aqeedah (creed) and Ittibaa&#8217; (way of following). It was a blend for every sect. Amongst them you find the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’atazilite, the Maatureedi, the Ash’aree, the Shee’iee, the philosopher, the Murj’i, the Jabri, and followers of all sorts of Ahwaa’(desires and innovations). For Ahlul Ahwaa&#8217; (followers of lowly desirers and innovations), Soofism became a universal ground which they penetrate in the name of spiritual guidance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During the sixth century</strong></span>, a group of mystic Soofis claimed to be descendents of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and each one of them established for himself a special Soofee order with special followers. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ar-Rifaa’i</strong></span> appeared in ‘Iraaq, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Badawi</strong></span> and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ash-Shaathili</strong></span> in Egypt. These orders branched into other orders. In this century and in the next two, the Soofee Fitnah reached its climax with the ‘Aqeedah of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wahdat Al-Wujood</strong></span> (Unity of Existence), appearance of new Bida’ (building on graves and magnifying them, innovated celebrations, etc.), more Soofee orders and more superstitions. This was supported by the establishment in Egypt of the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Ubaydiiyyah State</strong></span> (known as the <strong>Fatimid State</strong>), which spread its influence over many Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, during the latter centuries, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, the Soofee orders reached the thousands and the Soofee practices and affiliation spread over the entire Muslim world. Today, Soofism has establishments, preachers, funding, and almost unrestricted movement of its people across the borders of many Muslim and non-Muslim countries. As to its most important objectives, I leave it to a Soofee enthusiast well known in the circles of Soofism, Saayed Hossein Nasr, who stated that, “All that we can do is to stress that the Soofee teachings center upon two fundamental creeds: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wahdat Al-Wujood</strong></span>, and <strong>Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man)</strong>. [11] [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During all of this past of Soofism and nowadays, Soofism was not left without challenge. The Salaf gave their advice and warned against the early deviations and mistakes of some the early Soofis. They exposed the false concepts of beliefs and practices of Soofism in the past and in the present. This, by Allaah’s Grace, benefited and continues to benefit the Muslims worldwide. The truth propagated by the followers of the Salaf is finding its way everywhere despite the efforts by its opponents who try to disseminate among the people it causes rifts between the Muslims while they represent &#8220;the way of unity&#8221; through their so-called Mainstream Islam. The Path of the Salaf distinguishes between the truth and falsehood and calls to unite the Muslims on the true <strong>Tawheed</strong> and pure <strong>Ittibaa</strong>’ (following of the established Sharee&#8217;ah). This makes it binding that the followers of the Salaf should be a good example and use wisdom and kindness in their efforts to propagate the truth without compromising the principles of the Deen. Errors by some of the followers of the Salaf should not hinder the truth seeker from accepting the truth regarding matters of the Deen, and he should judge according to the principle not the mistakes of people.</p>

And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “<strong>Perfect Man</strong>” or the “<strong>Al-Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong>”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!! <em>This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al- Jeeli (d.820 AH/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: <strong><a title="Permanent Link to Sufism : Origin and Development  – Dr. Saleh As-Saleh" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/04/12/sufism-origin-and-development-dr-saleh-as-saleh/" rel="bookmark">Sufism : Origin and Development </a>– Dr. Saleh As-Saleh</strong> (e-Book)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call for Zuhd in Islam is to lead a pious life devoted to Allaah (Azza wa Jal) taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc. nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment [by wearing your clean clothes] while praying and going round [the Tawaaf of] the Ka’bah, and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He [Allaah] likes not the extravagants.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “Who has forbidden the adoration with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal things] of food?” Say: “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, [and] exclusively for them [believers] on the Day of Resurrection [the disbelievers will not share them].” Thus We explain the Aayaat [Islamic laws] in detail for people who have knowledge. </em></span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-’Araaf, 7:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Azza wa Jal) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>But seek with that [wealth] which Allaah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allaah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allaah likes not the Mufsideen [those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischiefmakers, corrupted people].</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Qasas 28:77].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas [33] asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) whether he can will all of his property in charity, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to give only one third of it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“One third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from others.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) invoked Allaah (Azza wa Jal) to grant abundant wealth to Anas Bin Maalik :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas : My mother said, “O Allaah’s Messenger! Please invoke Allaah on behalf of your servant (i.e. Anas ).” He said: “O Allaah! Increase his wealth and children, and bestow your blessings on whatever you give him.”35 There are many other texts in the Qur’aan and (or) Sunnah which teach the medium course of this Deen in its acts of worship as well as in its codes for living this life in the way that pleases Allaah (Azza wa Jal).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast, we find that the Soofee type of Zuhd opposes the essence of true Zuhd laid down in the Qur’aan, authentic Sunnah, and as understood by the Salaf, mainly that it is a renunciation of that which is of no benefit in the Hereafter. Consider, for example, some of the so-called Soofee Zuhd:(2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2) Poverty, hunger, abandonment of lawful things and of Hadeeth, and other strange things:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Soofee master said, “I like for the beginner not to make his heart busy with the matter of earning (i.e. a living), otherwise he would change.” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another master said, “I have attained this state (of Soofee knowledge) by means of a hungry stomach and a naked body.”37(!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A call to abandon marriage and the seeking of hadeeth−knowledge is attributed to the “Soofee master” AlJunayd.[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ghazaalee also related the same saying of AlJunayd: “I like for the starting Mureed (Soofee disciple) not to occupy his heart in three things, otherwise his condition will change (he then named them as): (1)-Seeking to gain sustenance, (2)-Seeking knowledge of Al-Hadeeth, and (3)- Marriage.”[39]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within Soofee sources we find the following statement: “Hunger is the food of the Zaahideen!” [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdul Wahaaab Ash-Sha’raanee, an authority on Soofism in the eyes of the Soofis reported that Rabaah Bin ‘Amr AlQayeesee said: “A man would not attain the levels of the Siddeeqeen [41] until he leaves his wife as if she was a widow, his kids as if they were orphans, and takes refuge in dog houses!” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ash-Sha’raanee, Ibraaheem Bin ‘Usayeefeer was, “A man having a great deal of Kashf &#8230;He used to come to the town riding a wolf or a hyena, and to walk on water having no need for a boat; his urine was as white as milk&#8230;Most often he slept in a church, and he used to say: the Christians, unlike Muslims, do not steal shoes in the church.”[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidated the fasting of the Muslims who ate chicken and mutton meat. Only those who, like the Christians, do not eat mutton meat, their fast is correct as far as ‘Usayeefeer is concerned! [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A story of another “Soofee”, Ibn Al-Kurainee, the teacher of Al-Junayd in which he says that he subdued himself into humiliation for twenty years until it became like that of a dog! [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Soofee sources, Abu Yazeed, an example for many Soofis, devoted himself to Allaah and he had the determination to restrain himself from drinking water and from sleeping for one year! [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Sha’raanee also reported that one of the celebrated Soofee so-called Awliyaa’ by the name of ‘Abdur Rahmaan Al-Majthoob, “Cut off his own private part in the beginning of his Jathbah (a mystic Soofee state of Jathb)”! [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also reported that another Soofee mystic by the name of Yaaqut Al-‘Arshee (d.707 AH/1307 C.E.) married the daughter of his sheikh Abul ‘Abbaas Al-Mursee. She stayed with him for eighteen years but he never touched her being shy from her father. He left her while she was still a virgin! [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are only few cases presented in order to expose this early deviation in Soofism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas, one of the early sahaabah who accepted Islam and one of the ten companions whom the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought good news that they would enter Al-Jannah. He shared in the battle of Badr and Uhud and was one of the six members of the Shoora counsel which ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab chose to appoint the new Khaleefah after ‘Umar was stabbed. He was the first to shoot an arrow at the Mushrikeen in Jihaad. He lead the Muslims in taking over ‘Iraaq from the Persians after defeating them in the battle of Al-Qaadisiyyah in the 15th year of Hijrah (634 C.E.) He died in 55th year of Hijrahh (675 C.E.).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Introduction of the Book:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">KNOW, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon me and you, that the issue of Soofism may be confusing to some and may be clear to others. Many have come to know about Soofism as the highest form of “Spiritual Islamic practices.” A kind of rich tradition, that only the special and very pious can adhere to and practice. Consequently, if Soofism is criticized, they see that as an insult to Islam. Some, however, consider Soofism as a “Spiritual” path which Muslims and non-Muslims can associate with. The fact, however, is that the reality of Soofism is known only to the few amongst Muslims. This is due, in part, to the very deceptive nature of the propagation of the teachings of Soofism as done by its advocates who present it as a very special way of worship that is linked to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his noble companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who follow their path in righteousness. Is it, however, the case?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Attempting to answer this question about “Soofism,” I ask Allaah, the Most High, to assist me in relating the truth and to make this effort sincerely done for His Most Honorable Face.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sensible person must not be deceived therefore in the deceptive ways of mystic Soofism which tries to present itself as ‘spiritual Islam.” <strong>True spiritual matters in Islam do not oppose the Sharee’ah in any way</strong>. The address of Islam to the actions of the hearts is based upon sincerity and following the path of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. This is the way that truly draws the person to Allaah.</p>
<p>May Allaah guide all Muslims to the Path of Righteousness.<br />
He is All-Able to do all things. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on some people who say: &#8220;O Allah, I worship You out of my love for You. If I worship You fearing Your Hell, let me enter it and if I worship You seeking to enter Your Paradise, let me enter Your Hell&#8221;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Worshiping Allah just by loving Him is the Manhaj (methodology) of misguided Sufis, which is of their own invention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loving Allah is the highest degree of Ibadah (worship), but not the sole act of Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Manhaj of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) is to worship Allah through love, fear, hope and other expressive forms of `Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord withhumility and in secret</strong></span>.&#8221; [Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about His Prophets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.&#8221;</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"> [</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about the angels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they stand in awe for fear of Him.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 28]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) elaborating on this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah.<br />
</em></span><span style="color:#808080;"><em>By Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani.<br />
</em></span><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2654 – From Abu Hurairah from the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Whoever does not supplicate (make <em>Dua’</em>) to Allaah, then Allaah is angry with him.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari in ‘Adab al-Mufrad’, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim, Ahmad, Ibn Abi Shaybah, al-Bayhaqi in ‘ash-Shawba’ and by Tabaraani. Albani declared it <em>Hasan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani brought a supporting hadeeth from an-Nu’maan <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>, the wording of which was: ‘<strong><em>Dua’</em> is worship</strong>’ then the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>And your Lord said:<span style="color:#008000;"> ‘Call on Me, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and ask Me for anything) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will respond to your </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(invocation)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Verily! Those who scorn My worship </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness,]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span></strong></span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by the collectors of the <em>Sunnan</em> and by other than them. Ibn Hibban, al-Hakim and Dhahabi authenticated it, as well as others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is researched in ‘Ahkaam al-Janaiz’, ‘Saheeh Abi Dawood’ and in ‘Rowda al-Nadeer’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani comments:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And there is no doubt that staying away from Allaah’s <em>-Ta’ala-</em> worship due to arrogance and not making <em>Dua’</em> to Him necessitates Allaah’s anger upon the one who does not make <em>Dua’</em> to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth [of Nu’maan] is a strong support for the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah due its meaning and not from its chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the <strong>ignorant Soofis</strong> have neglected these Ahadeeth or have pretended to neglect them.  They claim that making <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah is inappropriate behaviour with Allaah, they have become affected with an <em>Israeeli</em> narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#ff0000;">‘His knowledge of my condition spares me from asking from Him.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So they were ignorant that when the slave of Allaah makes <em>Dua’</em> to His Lord <em>–Ta’ala-</em> it is not the case that the slave of Allaah is informing Allaah <em>–Subhanahu wa Ta’ala –</em> his need of Him &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">He knows what is kept secret and that which is yet more hidden.</span> &gt;&gt; rather it is the act of actualization of the <em>Uboodeeyah</em> of Allaah (servitude of worship) and the slave of Allaah’s need of Him and his own impoverishment.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between the <em>‘Aqeedah </em>of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> and the<em>‘Aqeedah</em> of the grave worshipping Soofis</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by Abbas Raheem<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The grave worshipping Soofis promote matters of <em>Shirk</em> and innovation by way of the media, and from those matters is <em>Isteegatha</em>(seeking closeness to Allaah) from the dead of the Prophets, and the righteous people.  This is a refutation against their falsehood and their trickery of the worshippers by mentioning what is ambiguous from the texts of Islaam, and using weak hadeeth and narrations, and their own understanding of the authentic hadeeth other than the understanding of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>.  This refutation also contains the position of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> regarding this issue, according to the<em>‘Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and all capability is from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Isteegatha</em> linguistically means requesting aid and victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sharia’</em> definition: There is no difference with the linguistic meaning, since it means requesting help and relief from distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>Isteegatha</em> is a type of <em>Dua’</em>(supplication), and <em>Dua’</em> is worship, as has been mentioned in the hadeeth of an-Numaan bin Basheer who said that the Messenger  of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said : ‘<em>Dua’</em> is worship.’  Narrated by Ahmad and Tirmidhee and he said the hadeeth was <em>hasan saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> is that all worship, whether apparent or internal, is prohibited until there is an evidence from the<em>Sharia’</em> that makes the action permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is understood, then know – may Allaah have mercy upon you, and may He direct you to His obedience &#8211;   that making<em>Isteegatha</em> from the people is divided into two sections according to the <em>Salaf</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> :  The <em>Isteegatha</em> which is permissible : and that is seeking assistance in the time of need from a living person, with that which he has the ability to help with, without having to lower oneself to that person, or with humiliation in any form, or having submission in the same way that you ask from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the evidences that show the permissibility of this type of <em>Isteegatha</em> is:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> regarding the story of Musa <em>– alayhi as-sallam &#8211;</em> : &lt;&lt;The man from his (own) party asked him for help against his foe&gt;&gt;</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Help one another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&gt;&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second</strong>: The <em>Isteegatha</em> which is prohibited, is of two types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> Seeking assistance from living people with that which only Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> has the ability to help with, and there is agreement amongst the scholars, that this is prohibited.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the evidences for this issue, is the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And invoke not besides Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you…..&gt;&gt;</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> Making <em>Isteegatha</em> with the dead, from the Prophets or the righteous people.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs of this prohibition is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And if My slaves ask you about Me, then I am close, and I answer the <em>Dua’</em> of the caller if he supplicates to Me.  So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ponder – may Allaah look after you – about when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was faced with questions, and the answer would come from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, and Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> would make the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  an intermediary to convey the answer, so Allaah would say to him : &lt;&lt;<strong>Say</strong>….&gt;&gt; meaning O Muhammad tell them.  The following are examples of that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the new moons.  <strong>Say</strong>: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage. &gt;&gt; 2:186</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> : &lt;&lt;They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months (i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Islaamic calendar). Say, “Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allaah is to prevent mankind from following the Way of Allaah, to disbelieve in Him,&gt;&gt; 2:217</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you (O Muhammad ) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.’ &gt;&gt; 2:219</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you what they should spend.  <strong>Say</strong> : whatever you spend of good&gt;&gt; 2 : 215</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: ‘Allaah directs (thus) about <em>Al­Kalâlah</em> (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs) &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you what is lawful for them as food. <strong> Say</strong> : lawful unto you are all kinds of <em>halaal</em> food. &gt;&gt; 5:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): ‘When will be its appointed time?’ Say: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the spoils of war. <strong>Say</strong>: the spoils of war are for Allaah and the Messenger&gt;&gt; 8: 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was an intermediary to convey the message directed to him from Allaah <em>Ta’ala </em>by His saying : &lt;&lt;Say…&gt;&gt;, except in the issue of <em>Dua’</em>.  Indeed Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> did not make the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> an intermediary for <em>Dua’</em>, but Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> Himself undertakes the answering of the<em>Dua’</em> directly without saying: &lt;&lt;Say…&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, is our Lord close so we can have intimate discourse with Him, or is He far, so that we have to call in a loud voice?’  Then Allaah revealed: &lt;&lt;And if My slaves ask you about Me, then I am close, and I answer the <em>Dua’</em> of the caller if he supplicates to Me.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in his book ‘Kitab as-Sunnah’1/ 277 and Ibn Hibban in his book ‘ath-Thiqaat’8/436, and at-Tabari mentioned it as a reason for the revelation of the <em>Ayaah</em> in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 2/158, and Ibn Katheer in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 1/219, and Qurtubi in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 2/308, and he mentioned it as a reason for it being revealed, on the authority of Hasan al-Basari – may Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a divine indication that Allaah does not love that, nor is a slave in need of intermediaries or intercessors when he supplicates to his Lord <em>Azza wa Jaal</em>, rather he supplicates to Allaah directly and the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> &lt;&lt;So let them obey Me &gt;&gt; means : that they supplicate to Me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Say O Muhammad: I do not possess anything for myself that will benefit me nor harm me.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so indeed this <em>Ayaah</em> clearly explains that he (the Messenger of Allaah) does not control for himself that which will benefit him nor that which will harm him, so how can he possess that for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what confirms this point is the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> : ‘O Fatima daughter of Muhammad, O Safiya, daughter of AbdulMuttalib, O tribe of AbdulMuttalib, I do not possess anything for you from Allaah, but ask me whatever you want from my wealth.’ Narrated by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call unto those besides Him whom you pretend [to be gods like angels, Iesa (Jesus), ‘Uzair (Ezra), etc.]. They have neither the power to remove adversity from you nor even to shift it from you to another person.’ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the <em>Salaf</em> said that this <em>Ayaah </em>was revealed about groups of people who used to supplicate to <em>al-Azeez</em>, the Messiah and the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person says that those people used to worship them (angels, prophets etc.)  and not worship Allaah, but as for us then we don’t worship them, rather,  we take them as intermediaries and intercessors with Allaah !!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the answer to them is: This statement of yours, is like the statement of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> at the time of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;We do not worship them except that they bring us closer to Allaah&gt;&gt; and in spite of what they said, their claim was not accepted, nor did it benefit them, and the Messenger of Allaah fought against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> A fundamental principle is that the dead are not like the living, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says: &lt;&lt;The living and the dead are not the same&gt;&gt; fundamentally the dead do not hear the living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt;And you do not make those in the graves to hear.&gt;&gt; except where the evidence shows exceptions to this principle, and here are some examples:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> When the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> spoke to the dead of the<em>Mushrikeen</em> after the battle of <em>Badr</em>, while they were in the well before they were buried.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And about this Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdasee – may Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘and this was a miracle of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and a matter that was specific to him, so you cannot use for anyone other than him.’ Taken from ‘Kitaab al-Mughnee’10/63.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> The dead hear the footsteps of his companions.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>c)</strong> The soul of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is returned to him so that the angels can convey to him the <em>Sallam</em> of anyone who sends <em>Sallam</em> upon him.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>d)</strong> When the dead person hears the <em>Sallam</em> of the one who sends<em>Sallam</em> to him at his grave. This is according to those who authenticate this hadeeth.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence to show that the dead person hears the living person who asks of him and makes a request from him, and if there is no evidence for this then the principle is that the issue remains as it is, that the dead cannot hear the living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fundamental principle is that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is human, and the origin regarding the issue of death, is that he is like the rest of mankind. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says: &lt;&lt;Indeed you will die, and indeed they will die&gt;&gt; except for what the evidence exempts, that the earth does not eat up his body and that his soul is returned to him in the grave to receive the <em>Sallam</em> of the one who sends <em>Sallam</em> to him, and that the actions of his <em>Ummah</em>are presented to him, and this is according to those who authenticate the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the dead not being able to hear the living has been established about the leader of the sons of Adam <em>– alayhi as-Sallam –</em> then this more readily applies to other than the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. If this is established that the Prophets do not hear the question of the one asking the question, then ponder over the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5</strong> – The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;So when you have finished, then stand up for Allaah’s worship.  And to your Lord turn all your invocations&gt;&gt; and He did not say ‘Turn your invocations to the Prophets and the righteous people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tabaree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, ‘The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala:</em> &lt;&lt;And to your Lord turn all your invocations&gt;&gt;  Allaah mentions is : O Muhammad direct your fervent desires to your Lord, and not to any one from the creation since the <em>Mushrikeen</em> from your people have made their fervent desires to gods and their  associates. The people of <em>Tafseer</em> have also said similar to what we have just mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book <em>Tafseer</em> at-Tabaree 30 / 237.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6</strong> – Indeed what the Companions <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhum &#8211;</em> knew and understood is that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was not made as someone from who aid was sought after his death nor was he taken as an intermediary, and this is confirmed by what has been narrated by al-Bukhari 1 / 342 and others have also narrated this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu &#8211;</em>  and then on the authority of Umar bin al-Khattab  <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu &#8211;</em>  if there was a drought, he would request rain by asking al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, and he would say : ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make<em>Tawassul</em>) with Your Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and You would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if you dear brother, dear reader, being unbiased, ponder that Umar and the senior Companions did not regard the permissibility of (<em>Tawassul</em>) coming closer to Allaah nor seeking assistance with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> after his death, compared to when he was alive, in fact in their request for rain they used to make <em>Tawassul</em> with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, but after he passed away they did not make <em>Tawassul</em> with him. Indeed Umar <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu   &#8211;</em> said in his authentic, well-known and established supplication, agreed upon by the people of knowledge, which was said in the presence of the<em>Muhajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> in the famous year of the Great Drought. When the drought became severe and the people requested rain, he said : ‘O Allaah we used to, if we suffered from a drought, we used to make <em>Tawassul</em> with Your Prophet, and You used to give us rain, and now we make <em>Tawassul</em> to You with his uncle, so give us rain , and they were given rain.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This well known supplication was accepted by all the Companions, not one of them denied it.  This is one of the clearest examples of (<em>Ijma’Sakootee</em>) silent agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if <em>Tawassul</em> with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> after his death was like the <em>Tawassul</em> during his lifetime, they would have said, why are we making <em>Tawassul</em> with al-Abbas while we don’t make it with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who is the best and greatest of creation with Allaah? Since not one of them said this, then this shows us that they knew <em>Tawassul</em> was only during the lifetime of the Prophet , and after his passing away, <em>Tawassul</em> is with the <em>Dua’ </em>of the righteous living people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did not order any one of his Companions. if they had a need or were afflicted with a problem, that they turn to him and they seek assistance from him after his death. In fact the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu – </em>: ‘If you ask of anyone, then ask Allaah, and if you seek help, then seek help from Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by at-Tirmidhee and he said the hadeeth is <em>hasan saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is other evidence which shows that <em>Isteegatha</em> with the dead from the Prophets and the righteous people is not allowed according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

TRANSLATED: isma&#8217;eel alarcon<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Book</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled <strong>Dhammu maa &#8216;alayhi Mudda&#8217;oo at-Tasawwuf </strong>(Condemning the Practices of those who Claim Sufism) by Imaam Abu Muhammad Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The booklet was published by Maktab al-Islami and is a short treatise containing a fatwa (religious verdict) from this great scholar of the seventh century on some of the practices that those who ascribed themselves to Sufism were upon in those days, and still are upon till this day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fatwa generally focuses on <strong>musical instruments and singing</strong>, which were practices the Sufis performed, taking it as part of the religion and using that as a means of drawing nearer to Allaah. The Shaikh has filled his response With Quranic verses, prophetic ahaadeeth and narrations from the Salaf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish.&#8221;<br />
AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE: His treatise: &#8220;Kayfa Yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p>[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/take-what-you-wish-from-the-qur_aan-for-whatever-you-wish-e28093-shaykh-al-albaanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Read or Download PDF</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[1] <strong>Question</strong>: Noble Shaikh, I read a hadeeth in a small book, which states: <strong>“Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need).”</strong> Is this hadeeth authentic? Please benefit us, may Allaah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Answer</strong>: This hadeeth:<strong> “Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need)”</strong> is a hadeeth that has become famous amongst some tongues. But unfortunately, it is one of those hadeeths that have no basis in the Sunnah. So because of this, it is not permissible to report it or ascribe it to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this vast and comprehensive understanding (found in the hadeeth) is not valid and not established at all in the Legislation of Islaam: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish.”</strong></span> So for example, (this hadeeth indicates that) I can just sit at home and not go out to work in my job or occupation, instead seeking sustenance from my Lord – that He send it down to me from the sky – since I am taking what I wish from the Qur’aan! Who says such a thing!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this is a false statement. Perhaps it is a narration that was fabricated by those lazy Sufis who are accustomed to sitting and residing in those places they call ribaataat (hospices). They gather in these areas and sit there awaiting Allaah’s sustenance from those people who bring it to them. This is in spite of them knowing that this is not from the nature of a Muslim since the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم nurtured everyone to have high aspirations and to be dignified, as he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The upper hand is better than the lower hand. The upper hand is the one that gives and the lower hand is the one that asks (i.e. begs).”</strong> </span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning this topic, I was amazed by a story I once read regarding one of these ascetics and Sufis, but I will not prolong it since their tales are many and bizarre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They claim that one of them went out one time traveling throughout the land without any provisions. So it got to the point that he was about to die from hunger when a village appeared to him from afar, so he walked to it. This was on a Friday. According to his perception, he had gone out while putting all of his reliance upon Allaah. So in order not to invalidate this so called “reliance”, according to his view, he didn’t make himself visible to the gathering of people in the masjid. Rather, he hid himself under the mimbar (pulpit) so that no one would notice him. But he kept telling himself that perhaps someone would detect him. In the meantime, the speaker (khateeb) delivered his sermon and this man failed to pray along with the congregation! After, the Imaam finished giving his sermon and praying, the people began exiting the doors of the masjid in groups and individually. This was such that the man felt that the masjid would soon be empty, at which point the doors would be locked and he would remain alone in the masjid without any food or drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So he had no choice but to make some sounds like that of one clearing his throat in order to let those present known that he was there. Some people realized someone was there so they went and found a man that looked like he had nearly transformed to just bones due to hunger and thirst. The people took hold of him and rushed to assist him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They asked him: “Who are you, sir?”</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> He replied: “I am a zaahid (ascetic), one who puts his reliance in Allaah.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They said: “How can you say ‘I am one who puts his reliance in Allaah’ when you almost died. If you had truly put your reliance in Allaah, you would not have asked (for help), nor would you have alerted the people to your presence by clearing your throat. And as a result you would have died due to your sin!”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example of the extent that can be reached due to the likes of this hadeeth: “Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize: This hadeeth has no basis to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">What Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari [1] said About The Soofeeyah<br />
Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Seeking Blessings</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw a person who came for Hajj and there were people gathered around him, and they took his turban, it was white, they tore it up, and some of them began eating it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said to one of them: ‘Why do you eat from his turban?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person said: ‘This person is a Haji and we are seeking blessings from his turban.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wanted to make him understand [that this is wrong] but he refused to accept and also those along with him.’[2]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 – Superstitions</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed all types of superstitions are in the Turq (different paths of the Soofeeyah).’[3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Play</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The worship of the Soofeeyah is playing.’[4]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 -Naqshbandeeyah </strong><strong>[5]</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one authors, distributes and prints books against the Dawa’ as-Salafeeyah[6] in the world like that what the Turks do and the government of the Rawafidah (Shia) in Iran.  Because the increase of ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah was not lessened until the Turks began ruling. They are the Naqshbandeeyah, and the Naqshbandeeyah are the enemies of the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah.’[7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – Relieved from Worship</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I saw a man in Africa who was a big Soofi, and people would come to him and kiss his head, his hand, his belly, and his feet and there was a large majority of people around him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the prayer time came he did not pray, so I asked about this, and his companions said to me: ‘He does not pray because he is relieved of Islaamic duties. I had read about these types of people in books, and now I have seen them.’[8]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6 – The Soofeeyah are Made Up Of</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Soofeeyah are made up of Judaism, fire-worshippers, polytheism, and a basic foundation of Islaam, but Islaam only by name, and they are the brothers of the colonialists.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari adds: ‘He means the extreme Soofeeyah.’[9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7 – Dangers of the Soofis</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Soofi deviants are more dangerous to Islaam than the disbelief of the Russians and Americans.  Because they are negligent with the truth.’[10]<a href="http://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2014/04/12/what-shaykh-hamad-al-ansaari-said-about-the-soofeeyah/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"></a></p>

Taken from Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a group of people – i.e. from the Sufis – came and began to speak to them concerning hunger, poverty, whisperings and notions. And they authored books on these subjects, as was the case with Al-Haarith Al-Muhaasibee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another group of people came (afterward) that revised the way of Sufism, characterizing it with attributes by which they distinguished it (from its original state), such as: wearing old tattered clothes, hearing (music), bursting out in passionate emotions, dancing and clapping. And they particularized themselves by exceeding in cleanliness and purification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this matter (Sufism) continued to flourish, and their shaikhs began to fabricate stories for them and speak about their mystical occurrences. This affirmed their remoteness from the scholars. Rather, this even affirmed their view that what they were upon was the most complete forms of knowledge, such that they named it the hidden knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-ul-baatin</i>), while making knowledge of the Religion, apparent knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-uhd-dhaahir</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them were those whose severity in hunger brought them to fancy corrupt notions. So they would claim strong love and passion for the truth. It was as if they imagined a figure with a beautiful appearance and thus fell madly in love with it. These individuals linger between disbelief and innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then these people divided into various orders and their beliefs grew corrupt. So among them were those who held the view that Allaah is incarnate in His creation (<i>hulool</i>), and those who held the view that the Creator and creation were in reality one existence (<i>Ittihaad</i>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Devil did not stop speaking to them about different types of innovations until they made them into aspects of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan As-Sulamee who wrote a book for them called ‘<i>as-Sunan</i>.’ He also compiled a book for them called ‘<i>Haqaa’iq-ut-Tafseer</i>’, in which he mentioned amazing things about them (i.e. Sufis) concerning their interpretation of the Qur’aan, based on the (mystical things) that occurred to them, without tracing that back to any of the sources where knowledge is derived from. And indeed, what brought them to take such things and place them as their views was their state of daze, due to their strict abstinence of food and their love for talking at great lengths of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mansoor ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Qazaaz informed us that: Abu Bakr Al-Khateeb informed us, saying: Muhammad bin Yoosuf Al-Qattaan An-Naisaburee said to me: &#8220;Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan As-Sulamee is not reliable. He was not able to hear anything except for a few sounds, due to deafness. So when the ruler Abu ‘Abdillaah bin Al-Bay’ died, he began to narrate hadeeth on the authority of Al-A’asam from Taareekh Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een as well as other books besides it. And he would fabricate <i>ahaadeeth</i> for the Sufis.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr As-Siraaj wrote a book for them called ‘<i>Lum’-us-Soofiyyah</i>’ in which he stated horrendous beliefs and hideous statements that we will mention later in more detail, by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Taalib Al-Makkee wrote the book <i>Qoot-ul-Quloob </i>in which he mentioned fabricated ahaadeeth and narrations that cannot be traced back to any source with regard to the subject of prayers during the days and nights and other subjects. He also mentioned false doctrines in it and constantly repeated statements such as: <b>&#8220;Some of the mukaashifeen (those to whom Allaah has disclosed secrets of hidden realities) have stated&#8230;&#8221;</b> These types of words are empty and pointless. He also mentions in it, relating from some Sufis, that Allaah reveals aspects of the hidden matters to his &#8220;saints&#8221; in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mansoor Al-Qazaaz informed us: Abu Bakr Al-Khateeb informed us, saying: Abu Taahir Muhammad bin al-‘Ullaaf said: &#8220;Abu Taalib Al-Makkee entered the city of Basrah after the death of Abul-Husayn bin Saalim and ascribed to his views. The he traveled to Baghdad and the people gathered around him in the place of admonition to hear from him. So he began to speak but got confused and began to mix up his words. It was memorized from him that he said: <b>&#8216;There is nothing more harmful to the creation than the Creator.’</b> So the people declared him an innovator and deserted him completely. Afterward, he was prevented from speaking to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb said: &#8220;Abu Taalib Al-Makkee wrote a book in the language of the Sufis called <i>Qoot-ul-Quloob</i> in which he mentioned many horrendous and repugnant things concerning Allaah’s Attributes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu Nu’aim Al-Asbahaanee who wrote a book for them called ‘<i>Hilyat-ul-Awliyaa</i>’, in which he mentioned many evil and despicable things on the laws of Sufism. And he had no shame in stating that Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee, as well as the rest of the high-ranking Companions, were from among the Sufis! So in this book, he spoke of amazing things that occurred to them. He also mentioned Shuraih Al-Qaadee, Al-Hasan Al-Basree, Sufyaan Ath-Thawree and Ahmad bin Hanbal as being from among them (i.e. the Sufis). Similarly, in ‘<i>Tabaqaat-us-Soofiyyah</i>&#8216;, As-Sulamee mentioned Fudail (bin ‘Iyyaad), Ibraaheem bin Adham and Ma’roof Al-Kurkhee as being from among the Sufis, by pointing out that they were individuals who abstained from the worldly life and its luxuries (zuhd).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufism is a way that is well known for exceeding in abstinence of worldly luxuries (<i>zuhd</i>). What shows the difference between them (i.e. scholars above, and the Sufis) is that no one ever condemned abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>), whereas Sufism was condemned because of what we will mention later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abd-ul-Kareem bin Hawaazin Al-Qushayree wrote a book for them called ‘<i>ar-Risaalah</i>’, in which he mentioned many far-fetched and mystical things such as talk on <i>al-fanaa </i>(annihilation) and <i>al-baqaa </i>(subsistence), <i>al-qabd </i>(contraction), <i>al-bast </i>(expansion), <i>al-waqt </i>(the moment), <i>al-haal </i>(ecstasy), <i>al-wajd </i>(finding) and <i>al-wujood </i>(existence), <i>al-jam’ </i>(union) and <i>tafaruqqah</i> (separation), <i>as-sahu </i>(clarity) and <i>as-sakr </i>(drunkenness), <i>adh-dhawq </i>(taste) and <i>ash-sharab </i>(drink), <i>al-mahu </i>(effacement) and <i>al-ithbaat </i>(affirmation), <i>at-tajallee </i>(manifestation) and <i>al-muhaadarah </i>(presence), <i>al-mukaashafah</i> (unveiling) and <i>al-lawa’ih</i>, <i>at-tawaali’ </i>and <i>al-lawaami’</i>, <i>at-takween</i> and <i>at-tamkeen</i>, <i>ash-sharee’ah </i>and <i>al-haqeeqah </i>(reality),[1] and other insanities that do not amount to anything. And his tafseer is even more bizarre than this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Muhammad bin Taahir Al-Maqdisee who wrote &#8216;<i>Safwat-ut-Tasawwuf</i>&#8216; for them, in which he stated things that any person with common sense would feel ashamed to mention! We will mention what is proper from its subjects, with the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came Abu Haamid Al-Ghazaalee who wrote the book &#8216;<i>Ihyaa ‘Uloom-ud-Deen</i>&#8216; for them, according to the methodology of the (Sufi) people, which he filled with baseless ahaadeeth even though he knew well they were baseless. He spoke about knowledge of the <i>Mukaashafah </i>(unveiling of unseen by Allaah to Sufis) and withdrew from the principles of Fiqh. And he stated such things as: ‘Indeed the stars, the sun and the moon, which Ibraaheem saw, were in fact lights that screened Allaah!’ Such things are not mentioned in any of the sources of knowledge. Rather, this is from the types of speech of the Baatiniyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Al-Ghazaalee) also said in the book &#8216;<i>Al-Mufsih bil-Ahwaal</i>&#8216;: &#8220;While in their state of wakefulness, the Sufis are able to witness the angels and souls of the prophets, hear their voices and take hold of benefit from them. Then this condition escalates from the witnessing (of their) images to levels in which they are contained within these domains.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The factors that caused these individuals to write these books was their little knowledge of the Sunnah, Islaam and the narrations, as well as their dedication for what they approved of from the way of the people (Sufis). They only approved this way because of adoration for abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>) that was established in their souls. They did not see any condition better than the condition of these people (Sufis) in regards to appearance, nor any speech more pleasant than their speech, whereas in the biographies of the Salaf, they found a form of harshness. So the people inclined very strongly towards these individuals (Sufis).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was due to what we stated previously, that it was a way, which was characterized outwardly by cleanliness and worship, whereas on the inside, it was about indulging in leisure and hearing music, which the bodily dispositions incline to. The original Sufis would flee from the leaders and authorities. However (in later times) they became friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of these books that were compiled for them have things in them that cannot be traced back to any (authentic) source. Rather, they are only based on mystical occurrences that befell some of them, which they managed to take hold of and record. They called this hidden knowledge (<i>al-‘ilm-ul-baatin</i>). Abu Ya’qoob Ishaaq bin Hayya said: &#8220;I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal once when asked about the occurrence of delusions and notions, so he replied: <b>&#8216;The Sahaabah and the Taabi’een never spoke about such things.&#8217;</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="line-height:1.5em;">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> These are names for Sufi concepts and beliefs. Some of them have been defined as such: Fanaa: (Annihilation) A state in which the mureed (Sufi) becomes so absorbed in dhikr that he becomes unaware of himself and his surroundings and is at tranquility with the remembrance of his Lord, negating or annilihating his self. Bast (Expansion) and Qabd (Contraction) refer to the various degrees of relative union and separation from the Creator. Baqaa: The consciousness of survival in Allaah. Waqt: (Time) The moment in which someone becomes conscious of the reality and the Creator; the mureed is neither in the past or the future. Mukaashafah: (Unveiling) The state in which the Truth (Allaah) and the Unseen become revealed to the Sufi. Tajallee: (manifestation) the state in which Allaah manifests revelation to the Sufi. Sakr: (Drunkenness) A state in which the mureed is absorbed in the hidden matters to the point that the common person cannot understand him. Wajd: (Finding) State of ecstasy in which the Sufi finds the realization and presence of Allaah, usually after hearing (Samaa) dhikr. Jam’: (Union) A state in which the Sufi only sees the Truth (Allaah) without the creation. Muhaadarah: (Presence) Being in the presence of Allaah. Tafarruqah or Farq: (Separation) When the Sufi in the state of Fanaa sees the creation (i.e. himself), the opposite of Jam’. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Haqeeqat-ut-Tasawwuf (pg. 11-15) [1422 1st Edition]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words Tasawwuf and Soofiyyah were not known during the first generation of Islaam. Rather, they were only introduced into it after that or they were adopted into Islaam from other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in <i>Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa</i>: “As for the term Soofiyyah (Sufism), then it was not heard of during the first three generations of Islaam. Rather, speech concerning it only became known after the first three generations. Several Imaams and scholars spoke about it afterward, such as Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Abu Sulaymaan Ad-Daaraanee and others. It was also reported from Sufyaan Ath-Thawree that he spoke about it. Some of them also mentioned that on the authority of Al-Hasan Al-Basree. They differed in their views on the meaning of what a Soofee ascribes himself to, since the word ‘Soofee’ is a noun indicating an ascription, such as Al-Qurshee, Al-Madanee and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said to be an ascription to Ahlus-Suffah,[1] but this is an error, since if this were the case, they would call themselves <i>Suffee</i>. It is also said to be an ascription to the <i>saff </i>(row) that is the foremost before Allaah, but this is also wrong, since if this were the case, they would call themselves <i>Saffee</i>. It is also said to be an ascription to the <i>safwah </i>(best) from Allaah’s creation. This too is an error, since if it were so, they would have to call themselves <i>Safwee</i>. It is also held to be an ascription to Soofah bin Bishr bin Udd bin Taabikhah, an Arab tribe that used to be located next to Makkah in the past, which the ascetics would ascribe themselves to. Even though the ascription of Soofee is in conformity to this person’s name (Soofah) from a grammatical standpoint, it is also a weak opinion, since these people were not well known to most of the ascetics and because if the ascetics were to ascribe to them, it would have been more likely that they would have ascribed to them during the era of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and the Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also due to the fact that the majority of those who speak on behalf of the Soofees are not aware of this tribe and they are not pleased with being attributed to a tribe from the Days of Ignorance (<i>Jaahiliyyah</i>), which did not exist during the era of Islaam. It is also held, and this is the most well known opinion, that Soofee is an ascription to <i>soof</i> (wool). This was since the first time that the Soofees appeared was in Basrah (‘Iraq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first people that established the role of Soofiyyah were some of the companions of ‘Abdul-Waahid bin Zayd. ‘Abdul-Waahid was one of the companions of Al-Hasan Al-Basree who lived in Basrah and was into such great lengths in abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>), worship (<i>‘ibaadah</i>), fear of Allaah (<i>khawf</i>) and so on, the likes of which were not found in the rest of the inhabitants of other lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abush-Shaikh Al-Asbahaanee reported with a chain of narration connected to Muhammad bin Sireen that it reached him that a group of people preferred wearing wool, so he said: <b>‘There are some people that prefer to wear wool claiming that they resemble the Messiah, son of Maryam. However, the guidance of our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) is more beloved to us, and he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would wear cotton and other types of clothes.’</b> Or he stated words similar to this.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (Ibn Taimiyyah) said after this: “These people ascribe themselves to outer garments, which in this case is wool (soof) garments. So it can be said about one of them that he is a Soofee. However, their methodology is not restricted to the wearing of woolen garments, nor do they mandate that on anyone or adhere to ordering it. They only attach themselves to it due to it being the outer condition.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: “So this is the origin of Soofiyyah (Sufism). After this, it branched off and diversified.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyahs words, may Allaah have mercy on him, indicate that Sufism originated in the lands of Islaam at the hands of some very pious worshippers from Basrah as a result of their going to great lengths in abstinence (<i>zuhd</i>) and worship (<i>‘ibaadah</i>). Then after that, Sufism evolved and changed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conclusion that some modern-day authors have come to – that Sufism crept into the lands of the Muslims from other religions, such as Hinduism and Christian monasticism – has become accepted based on what Shaikh Ibn Taimiyyah reported from Muhammad bin Sireen, that he said: “There are some people that prefer to wear wool claiming that they resemble the Messiah, son of Maryam. However, the guidance of our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) is more beloved to us!” This indicates that Sufism has a connection to the religion of the Christians!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Saabir At-Tu’aimah said in his book: “Sufism – Its Beliefs and Methods”: “It appears that it came about due to the influence of Christian monasticism in which the monks would wear woolen garments and reside in their monasteries. There were many of them that would be upon this practice throughout the lands, which Islaam freed by way of Tawheed…” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ihsaan Ilaahee Dhaheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book “Sufism: Its Source and Origin”: “When we look deep into the teachings of the first and latter-day Sufis and the statements that have been quoted and narrated from them in the Sufi books of old and present, we see a huge difference between it and the teachings of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. Likewise, we don’t see its roots or its seeds in the history of the chief of all creations (Prophet Muhammad) (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) nor in that of his righteous and noble Companions, from the best of Allaah’s creation. Rather, contrary to that, we see that it has been derived and acquired from Christian Monasticism, Brahmanism, Hinduism, the religious devotion of Judaism and the asceticism of Buddhism.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Wakeel, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in the introduction of the book “The Downfall of Sufism”: “Indeed, Sufism is the lowest and vilest of schemes, which the Devil innovated so that the servants of Allaah can mock and ridicule along with him in his war against Allaah and His Messengers. It is the veil of the Magians (Majoos), which gives the impression that it is divine. Rather, it is the veil of every enemy to the true religion. Examine it and you will find in it Brahmanism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and the Manichaean beliefs. You will find Platonism in it. You can even find Judaism, Christianity and the idolatry of the Days of Ignorance in it.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through presenting the views of these modern-day writers regarding the origin of Sufism, as well as many other writers not mentioned here that hold these same views, it becomes clear that Sufism is a foreign concept that was introduced into Islaam. This shows in the practices of those who ascribe themselves to it – those practices that are foreign to Islaam and far removed from its guidance. By this, we intend the latter-day adherents to Sufism whose mystical illusions and fantasies have become many and great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the former predecessors, such as Al-Fudayl bin ‘Iyyaad, Al-Junaid, Ibraaheem bin Adham and others, then they were upon a state of moderateness.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: The Al-Tijaniyyah sect has their own supplication called Salat Al-Fatih, which they consider to be better than reciting the Qur&#8217;an. Is this true? Moreover, on Friday before Maghrib (Sunset) Salah and after Subh (Dawn) Salah, they circle around a piece of cloth on which, they claim, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Ahmad Al-Tijany sit. During such times they recite the supplication called Salat Al-Fatih. Please, provide evidence and clarify if this practice is proper.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>All their claims are false. Moreover, their deeds are null and void and are considered to be Bid&#8217;ahs (rejected innovation in religion).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For more clarification, I will cite the so-called Salat-ul-Fatih (Remembrance from the Tijaniyyah order).The following is cited in the Simplified Encyclopedia of Contemporary Religions, Doctrines, and Parties &#8211; The World Assembly Of Muslim Youths:<span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;Their leader, Ahmad Al-Tijany, claims that he physically met the Prophet, peace be upon him, talked with him, and learned Salat-ul-Fatih from him- The wording of this Salat reads: &#8220;O Lord, have peace and blessings upon our master Muhammad, the opener of the closed, the last of the prophets, the supporter of right with right, and the guide to Your straight path, his family as high as his standing and rank.&#8221; They have beliefs concerning this Salah, including:The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, told him that the reward for reciting it once is equivalent to that of reciting the Qur&#8217;an six times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, told him once again that the reward for reciting this Salah once is six thousand times as much as that for every Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), Du`a&#8217; (supplication), long or short, and the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an (Jawahir Al-Ma`any Wa Bulugh Al-Amany, vol. 1, p. 136)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The reward for such Salah is gained only if the reciter is authorized to recite it. This means there should be a chain of authorization tracing back to Ahmad Al-Tijany who, according to him, received this Salah from the Messenger of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allegedly being the words of Allah (Exalted be He), this Salah is deemed to be a Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) (Al-Durrah Al-Faridah, vol. 4, p. 128).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8211; He who recites Salat-ul-Fatih ten times will gain a reward that even an `Arif (Sufi who has reached a high station of worship) who had lived for one million years would not get if he had not recited it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8211; He who recites this Salah even once will have his sins forgiven and will have a reward as much as that for six thousand Tasbihs (saying: &#8220;Subhan Allah [Glory be to Allah]&#8221;), Du`a&#8217;s (supplication), and Dhikrs. (See Mushtaha Al-Kharif Al-Jani, pp. 127, 299 and 300.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that the following verse applies to the above: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, &#8216;This is from Allah,&#8217; to purchase with it a little price!&#8221; </span>The Committee elaborated on this sect in the previous Fatwas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble <em>Shaykh Ahmad ibn Ahmad Shamlaan (hafidhahullaah)</em> explained that <em>Zuhud</em> is to renounce worldly pleasures in order to gain nearness to Allaah. It is to leave off what Allaah has made <em>haram</em> and to do that which Allaah has made obligatory. This concept is of tremendous importance in <em>Islaam</em> and the <em>Shaykh</em>presented this in the form of a comparison between the proper and upright <em>Zuhud</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> to the extreme and deviant practices of the <em>sufis</em>. The <em>Salaf</em> best understood and practiced this noble principle. They had reached the pinnacle of sincerity and devotion to Allaah and strict adherence to the <em>sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>, performing all acts of worship in precise accordance to the legislated texts. The <em>Shaykh</em> showed the clear distinction of this to the absurd innovations of the <em>sufis</em> who went to such extremes in their <em>‘ibaadah</em>, out of their acclaimed piety, that many of their beliefs and practices fell into <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh Ahmad Shamlaan</em> <em>(hafidhahullaah)</em> continues in this lecture making distinct the falsehood of the<em>sufis</em> and the proper practice of our <em>salaf us saalih</em> in their implementation of <em>zuhud</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Watch the whole video and see the wisdom Allah has given to our noble Shaykh (May Allah preserve him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transcription of the above Audio</strong> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we travelled to &#8216;Kassala&#8217; in Sudan.<br />
It was Maasha Allaah.<br />
We did Da&#8217;wah there.<br />
Alhamdolilah.<br />
We talked and Allaah benefited the people there.<br />
It is a small town, so we visited all of the Masaajid there.<br />
They said :<br />
&#8220;There is only one masjid that we have not visited yet.<br />
And it is upon the Tijaanee methodology.<br />
And it is a Masjid that we have never been able to enter.&#8221;<br />
Because they are very stubborn.<br />
I said :<br />
&#8220;We will go there and ask permission.<br />
If they permit us to speak, we will speak.<br />
If they do not permit us to speak, we will leave.<br />
And that is up to Allaah.<br />
We did not come here with force.&#8221;<br />
So we went there and the Imaam led the prayer.<br />
After the prayer, I gave him salaam.<br />
[And said to him] :<br />
&#8220;Do you mind if I give a small talk to these brothers?&#8221;<br />
So he said : &#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;<br />
So I spoke, may Allaah bless you, and I called to Allaah.<br />
And I called to Tawheed and I called to the Sunnah and so on.<br />
And at the same time I refuted the mistakes.<br />
And the misguided beliefs that were present.</p>
<p>Until I reached the hadeeth of A&#8217;isha where she said:<br />
&#8220;3 things, if anyone were to tell them to you, Tthen he has lied upon Allaah a great lie.<br />
Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord has lied a great lie upon Allaah.<br />
And whoever says that Muhammad, knows the future, has lied a great lie against Allaah.<br />
And whoever claims that Muhammad did not relate the whole religion to the people has lied against Allaah a great lie.<br />
[Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p>So he got up and said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, Muhammad saw his Lord with his own two eyes that are on his head.&#8221;<br />
So I said to him :<br />
&#8220;May Allaah reward you with good.<br />
As for A&#8217;isha, [radiAllaahu anhaa], she is the most knowledgeable of his affairs.<br />
And she said that he did not see his Lord.<br />
And By Allaah, if he had seen his Lord he would have told her.&#8221;<br />
He kept on talking, so I said to him :<br />
&#8220;Wait until I have finished what I have to say.<br />
And then you can ask whatever you like.<br />
That which I know, I will answer.<br />
That which I do not know, I will tell you : Allah knows best.&#8221;<br />
I left him and I continued speaking.<br />
And I was not really sure if he stayed or if he left.<br />
Slowly I heard one of the men in the crowd saying :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, what this &#8216;Zuul&#8217; is saying is the truth&#8221;<br />
Zuul means man, in Sudan.<br />
Slowly he said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, what this man is saying is the Truth&#8221;<br />
I used : &#8220;Allaah said&#8230;.&#8221; and &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah said&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
May Allaah bless you.<br />
Then the athaan of Isha was called and I finished my speech.<br />
Then the Iqaamah was called.<br />
And the people started pushing me to lead the prayer.<br />
So I said :<br />
&#8220;Never, never. The Imaam should lead the prayer.&#8221;<br />
They said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, you lead the prayer!&#8221;<br />
So I said &#8220;OK&#8221; and I led the prayer.<br />
After the prayer, the youth from Ansar us-Sunnah and myself left the masjid.<br />
And I asked :<br />
&#8220;Where is the Imaam?&#8221;<br />
They said &#8220;They kicked him out!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Who kicked him out!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;His own Jamaa&#8217;ah kicked him out!&#8221;<br />
By Allaah, this is what happened!<br />
But if one was to come to them with this foolishness and insult them, meaning the Tijaaniyyah, the Burhaaniyyah and so forth, If one was to say this, who would accept it!?<br />
But if you came to them with wisdom and kindness.<br />
May Allaah bless you.<br />
Allaah benefited them!<br />
Allaah benefited them with this!<br />
So O brothers, use beneficial knowledge.<br />
And strong irrefutable evidences.<br />
And beneficial wisdom in your Da&#8217;wah.<br />
And it is upon you to have all of the beautiful manners that the Book Of Allaah and the Prophet of Guidance encouraged[Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa sallam]<br />
Because they are the tools of Victory.<br />
And they are the tools of Success.<br />
And believe me when I say that the Sahaabah did not spread Islaam and have it enter into the hearts of the people, except with Wisdom and their character, more then with the sword.<br />
Because the one enters Islam by sword will probably not remain steadfast.<br />
The one who entered Islaam by way of knowledge and evidence&#8230;.He is the one who will have strong faith.<br />
So it is upon you to follow these good ways.<br />
And it is upon you to be serious about knowledge.<br />
As it is upon you to be serious about giving Da&#8217;wah to Allaah.<span style="color:#000099;"><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#888888;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how good is what Abu Ahmad ash-Shayrazi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The <em>Soofeeyah</em> used to ridicule Shaytaan and now the Shaytaan ridicules them! !’</strong></span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Deception of the Shaytaan of the Soofeeyah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>comments on the statement of <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> when he spoke about the deception of the Shaytaan of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, when he <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The Shaytaan caused them to buzz around (dance) and to beat/strike the ground whizzing around on their feet, then sometimes he makes them like donkeys going around a pivot, and sometimes like insects dancing  in the middle of the house…’</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Shaykh (Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah</em>) intends the <em>Mutasawwafa</em> (<em>Soofeeyah</em>) who form into circles, then stand up in those circles and dance and swing from side to side to the tune of singing and musical instruments.  They shout, scream and dance together with what they call <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’</strong></span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that <span style="color:#993300;">Whistling and Clapping</span> is Prayer</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> speaks about the <em>Ayaah<br />
</em> &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands</span>. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee</strong> commented on this by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the <em>Soofeeyah</em> of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah is far from this.’</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Naqshabandiyyah</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling, in your understanding, on the Sufi Tariqahs (orders) in general, and the Naqshabandi Tariqah in particular?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: There is a lot of Bid`ah (rejected innovation in religion) practiced among the Sufi Tariqahs, such as holding Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) circles and gatherings in rows, in which they all repeat the Name of Allah together, saying, &#8220;Allah, Allah,&#8221; one of His Attributes saying, &#8220;Hayy (Ever-Living), Hayy,&#8221; or &#8220;Qayyum (Self-Subsisting), Qayyum,&#8221; referring to Him through the pronoun &#8220;Huwa (He), Huwa,&#8221; or repeating meaningless sounds, such as &#8220;Ah, Ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">They also repeat other formulas of Dhikr, in which they beseech help from other than Allah, seek support of the dead, such as Al-Badawy, Al-Shadhily, Al-Jilany, and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Their books contain a lot of Bid`ah and scattered evil, especially Al-Naqshabandiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In their daily Wird (sayings recited with consistency), they repeat the Name of Allah in their hearts, without moving their lips. The Murids (students) evoke their shaykh and his Wird, believing that this will be a means of saving them on the Day of Resurrection. These practices are all abominable acts of Bi`dah; none of these forms of Dhikr were reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what was sent to him in the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, authentically narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Anyone who does something that we have not ordered (in worship) it will be rejected.&#8221; The Prophet also said, &#8220;Anyone who introduces something in this matter of our (the religion) that is not from it, it will be rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
