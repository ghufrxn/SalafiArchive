<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If you see a man striving hard upon worship (<em>ibaadah</em>), living a life of abstention from all worldly comforts consuming himself with worship but he is a person of the innovated sects then do not sit with him and do not listen to his speech and do not walk with him upon any path for I do not feel secure that you will not eventually come to regard his way as something pleasing and thus go to destruction along with him.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 68 : Point 114</b><br />
<b>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</b></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <i>rahimahullaah</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">When discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>al-fitnah</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">) occurs, then remain within your house </b></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;"> and flee from proximity of discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah)</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">. And beware of </b><i><b style="color:#993300;">asabiyyah</b></i><b style="color:#993300;"> (bigoted fanaticism) and all fighting that </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>occurs</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> between the Muslims for this worldly life, then it is discord (</b><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah</i><b style="color:#993300;">). So fear and be dutiful to Allah, He Who is Alone, having no partner. And do not go out in it, and do not fight in it, do not fall into it, do not take sides, and do not incline towards one side and do not love anything from their affairs, since it is said, “</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>He who loves the actions of a people, </i></b><span style="color:#993300;"><i><b>whether</b></i></span><i><b style="color:#993300;"> they are good or bad, will be just like the one who did them</b></i><b style="color:#993300;">.” May Allah guide us and you to those things that are pleasing to Him and keep us and you away from the acts of disobedience to Him.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>NOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] Ibn az-Zubayr (<i>radi Allaahu anhu</i>) narrates: My close friend, Abul-Qaasim (<i>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</i>) advised me,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><b>If you reach anything of the tumult (</b><b><i>fitnah</i></b><b>), go to Uhud and blunt your sword upon it, then remain in your house</b></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad (4/226 and 5/69). Its <i>isnaad</i> is <i>hasan</i>, as has been mentioned by Shaikh al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) in as-Saheehah (3/no.1373).</p>

Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 64 : Point 110</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">Know that the roots of innovations (</b><em style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">Al-Bid&#8217;ah</em><b style="color:#993300;">) are four. From these seventy-two innovated sects branch off, each one of these have offshoots until they amount to two thousand eight hundred. All of them are misguidance. And all of them will be in the Fire except for one, which is those who believe in what is contained in this book, and who holds it as his creed, without having any </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>uncertainty</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> in his heart or any doubts. He will be a person of the Sunnah and he is the one who will be saved, if Allah wills </b></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] That is, whatever the book comprises of, from the sayings of Allah, the words of His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) and that which the Companions were united upon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically, the <em>Khawaarij</em> are those who rebelled against ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) in the 37th year of Hijrah (657 C.E.) and imputed <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) upon the arbitration that followed the Battle of Siffeen. They hated ‘Ali’s decision to end the <em>fitnah</em> which occurred with Mu’aawiyah (رضي االله عنه), calling ‘Ali’s acceptance of the arbitration a compromise. They also imputed <em>kufr</em> upon many of the <em>sahaabah</em> who accepted the arbitration. They did not even accept the whole of ‘Uthman’s (رضي االله عنه) Caliphate. This position stems from their misunderstanding of the Qur’aan. They deduced, wrongly, that major sins are <em>kufr</em> and thus forfeit salvation. Sin is a contradiction that nullifies faith! ‘Ali and the other <em>sahaabah</em> sinned in the eyes of the <em>Khawaarij</em> and that sufficed to nullify their state of belief! Their doctrine became famous in their rebellions against any Muslim leader who, in their eyes, committed a sin or a mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) informed us before his death of the emergence of this sect and that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>They will kill the Muslims and leave the idolaters. Should I live until they appear, I would kill them as the killing of the nation of ‘Aad</strong></span>.”[103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The <em>Khawaarij</em> are the dogs of the Fire.</strong></span>”[104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) delegated ibn ‘Abbaas ( رضي االله عنهما) to call them to the truth. He succeeded in convincing several thousands of them. Those who rejected continued to spread mischief even after ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) warned them against it. He finally fought them in the battle of an-Nahrawaan (38Hj/658) and only few of them escaped and continued the secession. ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) was himself killed by a Kharijite by the name of Ibn Muljam. They split into many groups and today they survive in ‘Oman, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and in Tanzania and they are known as the <em>Ibaadiyyah</em> (<em>ibadi</em> Kharijism).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> sect was later influenced by scholastic theology and its principles became very close to those of the <em>Jahmite</em> and <em>Mu’tazilite</em> sects. They center upon the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Imputing <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali, ‘Uthmaan and other sahaabah  (رضي االله عنهم أجمعين)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The right to rebel and fight the Muslim rulers who may err or sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Justifying the rebellion and fight against disobedient Muslims (rulers and/or ruled) and that it is permissible for them to secede from the general body of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) They believe that the Qur’aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Qur’aan is the literal Word of Allaah Who uttered it in letter and sound and which He Spoke to Jibreel (alaihissalam), directly without a mediator, and who then brought it down to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). The Qur’aan is neither the word of Jib reel nor the word of Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) They distort the meanings of Allaah’s Attributes by resorting to figurative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Like the twelver <em>Shee’ites</em> and other deviant sects, they deny that the believers will see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. This contradicts what is asserted in the Qur’aan and authentic <em>sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) Imputing <em>kufr</em> on the Muslims who commit major sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) The majority of the <em>Khawaarij</em> deny the actual punishment in the grave that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) inflicts upon those who deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned are some of the major characteristics of the <em>Khawaarij</em>. I intended to give the reader some background about this very dangerous sect and which has influenced many Muslim groups and parties in our times leading to bloodshed in many parts of the Muslim World. The bloody confrontations are hard to stop in some places and that has distorted the view of Islam in many parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth, however, is emerging and will <em>inshaa’ Allaah</em> completely emerge on the hands of the true followers of Islam who are working hard to correct this problem with the good word without compromising the ‘<em>aqeedah</em> nor the <em>manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should be able to present the truth without imitating the <em>kuffaar</em> and their ways. In this respect, the words of Imaam Maalik (رحمه االله) are remembered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nothing will benefit this ummah to come except that which benefited its early generations.”</strong> [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the correct creed, methodology and righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit is that the Muslim should be aware that the principles of many of these sects are still alive and propagated by certain individuals and/or groups, and accordingly the believer must be cautious. [106]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 64</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when children are afflicted by anything in the life of this world then they feel pain. And that is mentioned because Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id said &#8220;<em>they do not feel pain</em>&#8221; and he lied.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/when-children-are-afflicted-by-anything-in-the-life-of-this-world-then-they-feel-pain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is mentioned on account of those who say that children do not feel any pain. And he mentioned this to refute this man and this man it is said that he was from the <em>Khawaarij </em>also<em>. </em>And the <em>Khawaarij</em> have even more surprising things than these worthless sayings on account of their ignorance and on account of their pretence to knowledge. When a child suffers something, he screams and he cries and he calls out for help and this is a proof that he indeed feels pain and this is something witnessed and felt. However, this man has strange sayings and from them is this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Al <u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> ibn <u>H</u>ajar said in Lisaan ul-Meezaan: &#8220;Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id ibn Zayd al-Ba<u>s</u>ree al-Zaahid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was mentioned by Ibn <u>H</u>azm in <em>Al-Milal W’al Ni<u>h</u>al</em> as being one of the <strong><em>Khawaarij</em> </strong>that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“With regard to every sin, even a small sin, even a slight lie which a person told as a joke that the person who does it is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), a <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) from the People of the Hellfire except that if he is from the people who fought at Badr then he will be a <em>kaafir</em>, a <em>mushrik</em> but he is from the People of Paradise”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his student `Abdullaah ibn `Eesaa used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“The insane person and the children and the animals never ever feel any pain on account of every ailment or anything else because Allaah never oppresses anything even by the extent of a tiniest ant.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) quoted this matter of pain from Bakr himself. From his foul sayings is that, “Whoever steals anything even to the amount of a mustard seed will remain in the Hellfire forever along with the disbelievers” and Ibn Qutaybah refuted this at length.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 32 : Point 41</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>ولا يخرج أحد من أهل القبلة من الإسلام حتى يرد آية من كتاب الله عز وجل أو يرد شيئا من آثار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أو يصلي لغير الله أو يذبح لغير الله وإذا فعل شيئا من ذلك فقد وجب عليك أن تخرجه من الإسلام فإذا لم يفعل شيئا من ذلك فهو مؤمن ومسلم بالاسم لا بالحقيقة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And no one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> leaves Islaam unless he rejects an <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic or rejects anything from the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or praise to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah. So, if he does any of that then it is binding upon you to expel him from Islaam and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/no-muslim-exits-islaam-unless-he-perpetrates-that-which-nullifies-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> exits from Islaam except through committing one of the well-known <em>nawaaqid</em> (nullifiers of Islaam) along with any valid excuse being removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or through his rejecting anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, if he denies the Qur&#8217;aan or a part of it or the authentic Sunnah or a part of it or he rebuts anything from the Qur&#8217;aan or rebuts anything from the authentic Sunnah then he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy) because he is denying the truth of what has been said by Allaah and his Messenger as long as he is not <em>jaahil</em> (an ignorant person) or <em>muqallid</em> (someone just blindly following somebody else) or <em>muta`awwil</em> (somebody’s who’s misinterpreting), in which case the matter is made clear to him and when it is made clear to him and if he still persists then he is judged to be guilty of apostasy. And what is meant by <em>aathaar</em> (narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>or he rejects anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, meaning he becomes a disbeliever and this is a tremendous principle with the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. With it they contradict two groups;</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Khawaarij</em></strong> and the extremists, those who declare people to be disbelievers on account of <em>kabaa`ir</em> (committing major sins), which are less than shirk and,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Murji`ah</em></strong>, those who say that sin does not harm if a person has <em>eemaan</em> as long as the person is a believer; has eemaan in his heart then no sins will harm him even if he leaves off all actions and does not do any action then he will be a believer (<em>mu`min) </em>who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> <em>W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) then it is just as the author said that they are upon a middle and balanced position between the two groups. So they say that the <em>kabaa`ir </em>(major sins) vary. So, if it something from shirk or major <em>kufr</em> then he exits from the religion by consensus. And as for if it is not <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and if it is not shirk and it is not denying the Book of Allaah nor the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and it is not abandoning the prayer and it is not calling upon other than Allaah or sacrificing for other than Allaah, rather  it is just a major sin, it is less than that then this does not cause a person to exit from Islaam contrary to the <em>Khawaarij </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>. However, it does harm the believer and it will reduce his <em>eemaan</em> contrary to the <em>Murji`ah</em>, those who say that sin does not harm along with <em>eemaan</em>. So, this is the middle position, which harmonises between the texts of <em>Wa’eed (which mention a threat of punishment)</em> and the texts of <em>Wa‘ad</em> ( which mentions a promise of reward)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> took hold of the texts of the threat and they abandoned the texts of promise. Whereas, the <em>Murji’ah</em> did the opposite, they took hold of the texts of promise and they abandoned the texts where there is a threat. So, each of the two groups are <em>daal</em> (astray).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or unless he prays to other than Allaah or he sacrifices for other than Allaah,” </strong>such that he prays towards a grave seeking nearness to it or he makes prostration to an idol or he makes a sacrifice for other than Allaah and does anything from the acts of worship for other than Allaah then this person is a <em>mushrik</em> (a person of shirk), <em>a kaafir (</em>disbeliever) outside the religion and whatever is lesser than that then the people of the Sunnah are upon a middle position with regard to him in between the <em>Murji`ah</em> and the <em>Khawaarij</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does anything from that then it becomes binding upon you to expel him from Islaam,”</strong> if he does anything from that, meaning if he prays to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah or does an act of worship for other than Allaah then it is binding upon you to expel him from the religion and it is binding upon you to believe that he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> and you may not say this is not my concern or I don’t know about him. Rather, it is obligatory upon you to declare the disbeliever and the <em>mushrik</em> to be a disbeliever and that you declare the sinner to be a sinner, one who commits a major sin, which is less than shirk. So, the truth about this matter must be made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality,” </strong>meaning with regard to what is apparent with us and his hidden condition is left to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 31</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is permissible to fight the Khawaarij if they attack the property, persons or families of the Muslims; but if they desist and depart then it is not his right to chase them nor are their wounded to be killed nor may he seize their property as booty nor may he kill those of them taken captive nor may he chase those of them who flee.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369450953&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-permissible-to-fight-thekhawaarij-ifthey-attack-the-propertypersons-or-families-of-themuslims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have come to know that the Khawaarij are those who hold breaking away from obedience and they hold that there is no pledge of allegiance to the person in authority (the ruler) or that no bay`ah (pledge) remains if he commits sin; and they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins. So those people who accept this position but they do not have strength and they do not fight then they are left, along with their being advised and having the affair made clear to them so that perhaps they may return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for if they come to have strength and they manifest their force, then it becomes obligatory upon the Muslims to fight against them to repel their evil. And they are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers; rather they are fought against upon the basis that they are Muslims who have transgressed against the Muslims and attacked them. And for this reason when the Chief of the Believers (ameerulmu·mineen), `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> was questioned about the Khawaarij, “Are they disbelievers?” So he said, “No, they fled away from disbelief; but rather they are a people who transgressed against us.” [01],[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they (the Khawaarij) are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers, and therefore their women and their children are not taken as slaves and their property is not seized and those of them who are injured are not killed because the fighting against them is just to repel their evil, not because of their being disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is permissible to fight against the Khawaarij if they attack the Muslims with regard to their property, their persons and their families,”</strong> because the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded that they be fought against and because `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> fought against them when they attacked `Abdullaah ibn Khabbaab ibn al-Aratt <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And they killed him and they split open the abdomen of his slave girl who was pregnant. So then when they did that the Chief of the Believers (meaning `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>) resolved to fight them because the first signs of their evil had now appeared from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“But it is not for him (the Muslim ruler), if they desist and leave them alone, to chase them.”</strong> If they desist from fighting then it is not for the ruler to chase them and to wage war against them as long as they do not commit transgression. So they are astray without any doubt and it is obligatory to give them advice so that perhaps they will return; however they are not to be fought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he may not kill their injured,”</strong> because the wounded person, his evil has been curbed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not take their property as booty,”</strong> meaning their property is not taken as ghaneemah (booty/spoils of war) because it is the property of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not kill those of them taken prisoner,”</strong> because they are Muslims and their evil has been prevented by their having been taken captive and by their being wounded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and those of them who flee away are not to be chased.”</strong> If they are defeated, then the ruler leaves them alone and he does not chase after them because their evil has been repelled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by `Abdur-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf and al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You’ll find some narrations reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah also in his Musannaf, as indicated here also by al-Bayhaqiyy. And some of the reports contain the wording that `Aliyy radiyAllaahu `anh said something similar to this with regard to the People of the Camel, meaning the Companions who fought against him in the Battle of the Camel, and in some of the reports it mentions that he said something like this with regard to the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And as for this wording that Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned here, then it is indeed as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned it, he said it was with regard to the Khawaarij and it is an important difference with regard to the wording.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyya</strong>h <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in Risaalatu Fadli Ahlil-Bayt wa Huqooqihim (a treatise with regard to the virtue of the Ahlul-Bayt, the family of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and their rights) “It is established from ameerul-mu·mineen `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> through different chains that when he fought against the People of the Camel, he did not take their children as slaves and he did not take their wealth as booty and he did not kill their wounded ones and he did not chase after those who fled and he did not kill any captive and he prayed (the funeral prayer) over those who had been killed from both sides, at both the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffeen. And he said “Ikhwaanunaa baghow `alaynaa.”, “They are our brothers; they transgressed against us.” And he informed that they are not disbelievers nor are they hypocrites. And in what he said he was following the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, since he called them brothers and he declared them to be believers in the fighting and in the transgression just as is mentioned in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وَإِن طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا الَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن فَاءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said (two pages later),<span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"> “They are not equal those who were killed, who he prayed over and he called them ikhwaanunaa (our brothers), they are not equal along with those whom he did not pray over (the Khawaarij at the Battle of Nahrawaan).</span> </span>Rather, when it was said to him (quoting the aayah from Sooratul-Kahf (18), towards the end of the soorah), “Who are,</p>
<p>الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds! </span></strong>(18:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he replied, “They are the people of Harooraa· (meaning the Khawaarij).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> rahimahullaah mentioned, “And likewise, the people of Siffeen, he prayed the funeral prayer over those who were killed from them and he said, ‘They are our brothers, they transgressed against us but the sword purified them.’ And if in his view they had been disbelievers, he would not have prayed funeral prayer over them and he would not have declared them to be brothers and he would not have stated that the sword purified anything from them.” (Minhaajus-Sunnah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the Khawaarij the wording is as Shaykh al-Fowzaan put it here. What is authentic with regard to the Khawaarij that he said when they asked, “Are they disbelievers?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “No they fled from disbelief; they are a people who transgressed against us.” He didn’t call them his brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then he quoted the same quotes from Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And whoever rebels against one of the Muslim rulers, then he is one of the Khawaarij.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-rebels-against-one-of-the-muslim-rulers-then-he-is-one-of-the-khawaarij" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever revolts against a ruler from the Muslim rulers, then he is a Khaarijiyy (one of the Khawaarij).”</strong> Whoever departs from obedience to the one in authority and rebels against his authority, using the excuse that the person in authority has sins and has acts contrary to the legislation, as is done by the Khawaarij; then he has the ruling of the Khawaarij. And the Khawaarij are a deviant group which first sprouted in the time of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> when Thul-Khuwaysirah came and said to the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, when he saw him dividing the booty, he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do justice O Muhammad, for you have not been just!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,<br />
“Woe to you! Then who will do justice if I do not do justice?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when that man departed he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There will emerge from the progeny of this one&#8230;”</strong></span> Meaning from his type <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“&#8230;a people; you will belittle your Prayers in comparison to their Prayers, and your worship in comparison to their worship. They will recite the Qur·aan but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots straight through the game. So wherever you find them then fight them, for in fighting them there is reward for those who fight them.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to fight against them and that is in order to stop their evil from the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the case if they come out with weapons and they bear arms, but as for their merely manifesting the view of the Khawaarij and speaking with it but not fighting and not bearing arms, then in that case we rebuke them and we make clear to them their misguidance but we do not fight against them. However, if they gain strength and they start to fight against the Muslims then it is not permissible then for the Muslims to leave them. Rather it is obligatory upon the person in authority to fight against them, and it is obligatory upon the Muslims that they should be along with the person in authority against them, just as occurred in the khilaafah (Caliphate) of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> when he fought against the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And the Companions joined him and they fought against the Khawaarij along with him until they killed them in the worst manner; and through that he attained the reward which Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> promised in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed there is reward in fighting against them for those who fight against them.”</span></strong> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from the virtues of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, and his virtues are many. And from them is that he fought against the Khawaarij and he implemented the statement of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> regarding them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he has caused dissent within the Muslims and he has contradicted the narrations and his death will be the death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Khawaarij, they are the people who broke the unity of obedience and they revolted against the person in authority. And likewise they are the ones who declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins, kabaa·ir, which are less than shirk. So therefore they have two signs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first sign</strong> is their khurooj (rebelling) against the person in authority over the Muslims and their attempting to remove the one in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second sign</strong> is that they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of kabaa·ir (major sins), which are less than shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what led them to this is ghuluww (extremism), and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And therefore, the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against ghuluww (extremism) saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware of ghuluww (extremism) for those who came before you were only destroyed on account of ghuluww (extremism/going beyond the limits.)”</span></strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is adding to the Religion and adding to that which is legislated with regard to criticising an evil. This is ghuluww (extremism) which led the Khawaarij to what occurred from them. They had ghuluww, went overboard, in criticising an evil to such an extent that they split apart from unity of obedience and they went beyond the limit, to extremes in worship to the extent that they declared those people who commit major sins from the Muslims to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;he has contradicted the narrations&#8230;”</strong> Meaning the ahaadeeth which occur from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to adhering to obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;and his death will be a death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning because he has a characteristic from the characteristic of the Times of Ignorance (times of jaahiliyyah) because the Arabs in the times of jaahiliyyah (the Times of Ignorance) used to be dispersed within different tribes; they had no single ruler who would unite them, rather, each tribe would be independent on its own and they would make surprise attacks upon other tribes. And they did not unite except after Allaah sent Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He called them to Islaam so they accepted Islaam and they came to be beneath a single banner. And therefore He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember the favour of Allaah upon you that you were previously enemies, so He joined between your hearts and through His favour you became brothers.</strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when you were few and you were weak upon the earth, fearing that the people would snatch you away, and Allaah gave you shelter and He strengthened you with His aid and He provided provision for you from the good and pure things so that you may give thanks.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fruits of obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims, all these good things come about through that: establishment of security, the ability to seek provisions and the people being able to travel far and wide to seek provisions on account of the roads being safe. But when there is a state of fear, then in that case the people do not travel, they do not buy and sell out of fear for themselves. So these are from the virtues of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body) and of obedience to the one in authority. As for revolting against the one in authority and splitting away from obedience then that brings about the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> It causes the splitting of the United Body of the Muslims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The shedding of blood without right</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> The enemy overcoming; because the enemy are happy at this. And therefore you will find the disbelievers being joyful at the splitting of the Muslims, and they bring about splits between the Muslims and they aid the deviant groups. They provide them with weapons and they aid them with planning so that they rebel against the United Body of the Muslims, and splitting occurs among the Muslims, so that they can seize them as plunder, as happens. So all of this is a result of disunity and of disobeying the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and of rebelling against the ones in authority over the affairs of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, one who has no ruler, then he is like a person who lives in jaahiliyyah (Times of Ignorance) and if he dies then his death is like that of the Times of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever, but rather it means that he has a characteristic from the characteristics of the Days of Ignorance in that he does not enter under obedience to a ruler; instead he lives in chaos, <em>fowdaa</em>.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Chapter 14: We do not Call a Muslim an Unbeliever Due to his Sins</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] Ahl us-Sunnab believe that if a Believer commits sins, however small or large they may be, he does not become an unbeliever. If he leaves this world without making any repentance from them and he dies upon Tawheed and Ikhlaas, then his affair is entirely up to Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic. If He wills, He may forgive him and enter him into Paradise on the Day of judgement, safe and sound without being afflicted by the fire and without being punished for his perpetration of the sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will be brought on the Day of judgement with his sins and misdeeds. If Allaah wills, He will punish him for a period in the Fire. If He punishes him, he will not however remain in the Fire forever, but he will eventually be freed and taken out from it, to the place of tranquility and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[101] Our Shaykh, the Imaam Aboo Tayyeb Sahl ibn Muhammad as- Sa’lookee, raheemahullaah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The sinning believer, even if he is punished by the fire, he will not be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire. He will not remain there the same way as the unbeliever will remain there nor will he be wretched and miserable the same way the unbeliever is wretched and miserable.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[102] This means that the unbeliever will be dragged to the Fire on his face, he will be thrown in there chained, and then hung upside down, shackled by having his hands tied to his neck with strong and heavy chains. However, the sinning believer, if he is afflicted by the Fire, he will enter it like a criminal enters a prison in this world on his feet, not upside down nor thrown in. The meaning of his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;he will not, be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire&#8230;,” means that the unbeliever will have all his body burned and every time his skin is roasted through it will be replaced with another, so that he may taste the punishment again, as Allaah informs us in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, those who have disbelieved in our signs, we shall burn them in a fire. We shall change their skins for other skins, so that they may taste the punishment again.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4;56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believers they will not have their faces scorched by the Fire, and their limbs which they used for sujood will not be burned. For Allaah has forbidden the Fire from burning them. “ [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[103] His saying: “&#8230;he will not stay in the Fire like the unbeliever would&#8230;”, means that the unbeliever will remain in it forever and never come out of it. Allaah will never leave any sinning believer in the Fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “&#8230;he will not be afflicted like the unbeliever”, means that the unbeliever has no hope of the Mercy of Allah and no opportunity for reprieve from the punishment. As for the believer he will never be cut off from the hope of the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final outcome for all the believers is Paradise, as they were created for it and it was created for them, as a Mercy and a Blessing from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[113] The prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: &#8220;Allaah has forbidden the fire to eat up the traces of Sujood&#8221;. Related by al-Bukhaaree [806] and Muslim [182]</p>

<p><span style="color: #008000">As for the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em>, and they are the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>– and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible. &nbsp;However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.</span></p>



<p>.. <span style="color: #008000">Therefore, <strong>whatever is less than <em>Shirk</em> then it is under the Will of Allaah</strong>, and committing suicide is less then <em>Shirk</em>, likewise is <em>Zina</em> (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.&nbsp; All of these things are sins that are less than <em>Shirk</em>, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.&nbsp; If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;">He said : &#8216;Yes!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">So he replied : &#8216;Then it is only for you!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">And he left the opinion of the khawarij and became guided. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Daesh (in Arabic) are the initials for &#8216;Dawla al-Iraq wa Shaam al-Islaami. [Islamic state of Iraq and Shaam(1) &amp; in English termed as ISIS (2)] (3)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They do not know anything of Islaam except for the word &#8216;Islaam&#8217;, they are the most ignorant about Islaam.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This misguided sect came from the Khawarij [4] al-Qa&#8217;ida movement, the grandchildren of Abdurahman bin Muljam. [The evil dog who assassinated Ali RadhiAllaahu anhu]</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The al-Qa&#8217;ida movement was the mother whilst Daesh and Jabha an-Nusrah are the children.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The children (ISIS) have begun making Takfeer [5] of each other and killing each other as was the condition of their forefathers , the Najdaat and the Azaariqa who made Takfeer of each other and killed each other.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">So the children (ISIS) repeated the history of their fathers in making Takfeer, treachery and cheating. Moreover the children &#8211; meaning Daesh &#8211; have even more extreme exaggeration than their forefathers.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Khawarij of old used to make Takfeer of those who committed major sins. As for Daesh and those similar to them make Takfeer of both, those who commit major and minor sins!!!</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">When they make Takfeer of one of the Muslims <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> they &#8216;declare his blood, wealth and honour lawfully to be taken.&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I have been informed from the trustworthy people of Shaam</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That if Daesh make Takfeer of someone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; they carry out capital punishment for apostasy by being shot to death.<br />
&#8211; they take his wealth as spoils of war for the stockpile reserves for the Muslims.<br />
&#8211; they take the women folk of Shaam as slaves and they carry out lewd acts on them, with the argument that these women are what the right hand possess.<br />
&#8211; it has also been affirmed that they carry out pedophilia with the children of the Muslims and refuge with Allaah is sought.</p>
<p>they are filthier than the Jews and Christians and more defiled than the saliva of dogs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khawarij swear allegiance with the Shia against the people of Sunnah</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; when the Khawarij rebelled against the rightly guided Khalifa Uthmaan bin Affan &#8211; RadhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; there was with them Abdullaah bin Saba a senior from the Shia and along with some of those people who came from the land of Yemen, they entered along with the Khawarij and killed Uthmaan -RadhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Today this is Daesh which takes oaths of allegiance with the Shia Nusayreeya</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; they fight against the people of Sunnah in the land of Shaam; they have no mercy upon the young, or old, or those of intellect, nor the insane, or a woman or a baby.<br />
&#8211; they display the dead bodies of the Muslims and set fire to them.<br />
&#8211; the Hadeeth mentions: &#8216;The Prophet &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; prohibited mutilation and displaying the dead body.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; it is affirmed from the Messenger &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam:<br />
ً أوصاه بتقوى الله وقال لھم اغزوا ولا تغدروا ولا تمثلوا ولا تقتلوا امرأة )<br />
أنھ إذا أمر أمیرا<br />
ً<br />
ً ولا صبیا<br />
(&#8230;ولا شیخا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When he would appoint a leader, he would advise him with having Taqwa of Allaah. He would say to them go to battle, do not be treacherous, do not mutilate and display the body, do not kill a woman, old person nor a child.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khawarij hate the leaders of the Muslims and they make Takfeer of them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the Khawarij were not pleased with the authority of the Amir al &#8211; Mumineen Ali bin Abi Talib -RadhiAllaahu anhu.<br />
&#8211; they broke their oath of allegiance. . . and they made Takfeer of him and those who were with him. . . .<br />
&#8211; they waged war against him and they killed him treacherously when he came out to pray the Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> This is Daesh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; &#8216;they make Takfeer of the rulers of the Muslims.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;they make their blood lawful to take.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;rather they make Takfeer of everyone who opposes them from the Muslims.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;they wish to remove the Islaamic countries, because they do not view them as Islaamic countries, rather they view them as countries of disbelief. This was the &#8216;Aqeedah of the destructive Sayed Qutb, a leader of the Takfeeris (those who excommunicate Muslims) of the modern times.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"> The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; said:<br />
(یقتلون أھل الإسلام ویتركون أھل الأوثان)<br />
&#8216;They kill the people of Islaam and leave off the people who worship idols.&#8217;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The forces of Daesh try to wipe out the Muslims in the country of Shaam whilst the Muslims say La ilaha illa Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Just like the forefathers of Daesh did so when they killed the Muslims in Basara; they killed Abdullaah bin Khabbab bin al-Araat [6] and threw him in a river. Then they cut open his wife&#8217;s belly and took out the baby and threw him in the river as well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They would cut off the highways in Basra, kill the Muslim and let go the Christian.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; said :<br />
(لزوال الدنیا أھون عند الله من قتل مسلم بغیر حق)<br />
&#8216;The whole of the Dunyaa being destroyed is lesser to Allaah than unlawfully killing a Muslim.&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Daesh forces:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">○ The Daesh forces consist of a number of nationalities from different countries, from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the people of Morocco, they are the extremist of the people in excessively making Takfeer.<br />
&#8211; the people from Iraq and they are those who carry out killings, looting, plundering and crucifixion.<br />
&#8211; those from the people of the Arabian Gulf carry out suicide operations.<br />
&#8211; those from Chechneya are war commanders in Daesh.<br />
&#8211; those from the people of Sham from the Baith party are spies and traitors. They inform Daesh of the homes of Syrians so they can kill them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is some of what I have heard about this misguided sect, dogs of the Hell fire. I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to hasten their destruction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‹O people, indeed I heard the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur’aan, and your recital would seem insignificant compared with their recital, as would your prayer as compared with their prayer, and your fast, as compared with their fast.

<p style="text-align:center;">Scholar: ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
Reference: Darulhadith, Sweden<br />
Translation &amp; Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who incite the youths and say that our brothers are dying everywhere. They call in the name of Jihâd and that one shouldn&#8217;t obey the ruler in this (I.e. in Jihâd). Can you say something regarding this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: Shall we then also kill our own children, tear our homes apart and kill the Muslims if our brothers die everywhere? They rejoice in this. They rejoice in getting our brothers into these countries. They rejoice over these homicide-attacks in our countries. Is this Jihâd? Does this affect our enemies? It only affects us. It only affects the Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Attributes and Characteristics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Characteristic:</strong></span> They are young in age. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They have foolish minds &#8211; i.e. intellects. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They speak with the best speech amongst creation. [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> Their Eemaan does not go past their throats. [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They come out from the Religion just as an arrow comes out from the hunted game. Then they do not return back to it. [Muslim (no. 2496) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game</span>.&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report it states: &#8220;They shoot out from Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They have a weakness when it comes to understanding the Religion of Allaah. This is why it has been reported that &#8220;They recite the Qur&#8217;aan but it does not surpass&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2456)] &#8220;&#8230;or go past their throats.&#8221; [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their pharynxes (hulooq).&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their pharynxes {halaaqeehim).&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2469) from Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their collar bones (taraaqeehim).&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6934) from Sahl bin Haneef (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will make their tongues eloquent with the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 937) from Abu Bakrah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will recite the Qur&#8217;aan with their tongues but it will not go past their collar bones.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2470) from Sahl bin Haneef (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: &#8220;They will hold it (i.e. the recitation) to be for them, when it is against them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 916) from &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will think&#8230;&#8221; instead of &#8220;They will hold&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, he صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;They will call to the Book of Allaah, but they will have nothing to do with Allaah.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 941) from Abu Zaid Al-Ansaaree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, the Khawaarij and what they undergo when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan was mentioned to Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu), so he said: &#8220;They are not as extreme in their striving as the Jews and the Christians were, but yet they went astray.&#8221; [Ash- Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 27-28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;They believe in His clear verses, but go astray concerning His unclear verses 10 &#8211; No one knows their hidden meanings except Allaah. And as for those firmly rooted in knowledge, they say: &#8216;We believe in it.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8220;They are in a confused and drunken state. They are neither Jews nor Christians nor Magians, so that they may be excused.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventh Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are excessive in performing acts of worship, as occurs in the hadeeth in which the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم spoke to his Companions about them, saying: &#8220;Your prayer is nothing as compared to their prayer. Your fasting is nothing as compared to their fasting. And your reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is nothing as compared to their reciting.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration of this hadeeth, it states: &#8220;You will look down at your prayer as compared to their prayer&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;&#8230;(and you will look down) at your deeds as compared to their deeds.&#8221; [Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1231)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are the worst of creation and creatures. [Muslim (no. 2469) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The Khawaarij are an evil people. I don&#8217;t know of any people on the earth that are worse than them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Abu Bakr Al-Khallaal (no. 110)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Characteristic:</span></strong> Their distinguishing attribute is that they shave their heads. [Muslim (no. 2457) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, it states: &#8220;At-Tasbeet.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 4765) from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tasbeet means: Removing the short hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Tenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will kill the people of Faith and leave alone the worshippers of idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;They will kill the people of Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2451) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eleventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They will become so deeply absorbed (i.e. ta&#8217;ammuq) in the Religion [11] to the point that they will leave from it. [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 930) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twelfth Characteristic:</strong></span> They disparage their rulers and claim them to be upon misguidance, as &#8216;Abdullaah bin Dhil-Khuwaisrah did with the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call the people to the Book of Allaah but have nothing to do with it. [12] [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al- Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not believe that the people of knowledge and virtue hold a special position. This was why they perceived that they were more knowledgeable than &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il- Islaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. 13 [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.&#8221; [Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/240)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-34135"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu) held them to be the worst of creation. He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said about them: &#8220;They took ayaat that were revealed concerning the disbelievers and applied them to the believers.&#8221; Al-Bukhaaree reported this narration under the &#8220;Chapter: Killing the Khawaarij and Heretics after establishing the proof against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &#8220;And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should be avoiding.&#8221; [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventeenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will set out (to fight) against the best group amongst people.&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6933)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And among them are some who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of the (distribution of) alms&#8230;&#8221; [Surah At- Tawbah: 58] was revealed concerning &#8216;Abdullaah bin Dhil-Khuwaisirah At-Tameemee, the founding father of the Khawaarij. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6933) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Nineteenth Characteristic:</strong> </span>Their prayer does not go past their throats. [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Twentieth Characteristic:</span></strong> There is a great reward for he who kills them. &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;If the army that encounters them knew what was ordained for them upon the tongue of their prophet, they would only rely on that action.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4768)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it reads: &#8220;Whoever fights them has more right to Allaah than them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, it states: &#8220;Toobaa is for he who kills them and is killed by them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Ahmad (no. 19172) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin Abee Awfaa (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They are the worst of those who are killed under the surface of the sky. And the best of those who are killed is he who is killed at their hands.&#8221; And (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;These individuals were Muslims but became disbelievers.&#8221; [Ibn Maajah (no. 176)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They shed unlawful blood &#8211; whether their own by way of suicide or others by transgressing against them by way of murder. [Muslim (no. 246) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> As &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They will speak the truth with their tongues, but it will not go past this from them.&#8221; &#8211; And he pointed to his throat. &#8220;They are from the most despised of Allaah&#8217;s creation to Him.&#8221; He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said this when they told him: &#8220;There is no rule except for that of Allaah&#8217;s.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2468) from the statement of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the first ones who split away from the unified body of Muslims and declared them to be disbelievers due to (their committing of) sins. [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa of Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (3/349 and 7/279)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They beautify their speech but produce vile actions &#8211; after mentioning the differing and division in the ummah. [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> Every time a new generation springs forth from them, it gets cut off (i.e. from the Jamaa&#8217;ah). [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> There will emerge from amidst them the Dajjaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration it states: &#8220;&#8230;from their treachery&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one manuscript: &#8220;&#8230;from their ranks&#8230;&#8221; And that refers to a great army. [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They are from those in whose hearts is a deviation, as has been interpreted from the saying of Allaah: &#8220;But as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation, they follow what is unclear thereof&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 7] and His saying: &#8220;On the Day when some faces will be brightened and some faces will be darkened&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 106] that the ones who are intended by these verses were the Khawaarij. [Ahmad (no. 22313) from Abu Umaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever due to every sin. And they say: &#8220;The leave the fold of Eemaan and enter into disbelief.&#8221; [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 298) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They hold that the Muslims who commit major sins will reside eternally in the Hellfire. [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 360) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirtieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold it as an obligatory duty to rebel against the leader if he opposes the Sunnah. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/115)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the worst of people in deriving rules based on analogy. [14] [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/1 16)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They deem the subjects disbelievers &#8211; those absent as well as those present &#8211; if their leader commits disbelief. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/126)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare those who don&#8217;t agree with their views to be disbelievers, and they consider their blood lawful for shedding. The also permit the killing of the women and children that oppose them. This is done by the Azaariqah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that Faith (Eemaan) is: Knowledge of Allaah and of what the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم came with. So whoever commits something that he is not sure of as to whether it is lawful or unlawful, he is a disbeliever, since he was obligated to have researched into the matter. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/87)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that it is obligatory to fight against the ruler alone as well as whoever is pleased with his rule. As for those who reject the ruler, then it is not permissible to fight against them unless they support the ruler, attack the beliefs of the Khawaarij or serve as guides for the ruler. 15 This is done by the &#8216;Ujaaradah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They say: &#8220;Every sin that a person commits makes him a disbeliever, since he is ignorant of Allaah. This is done by the Makramiyyah al- Munshaqqah from the Tha&#8217;alabiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> There will be from among them those who will be with the Dajjaal during the Last Days. It was said to &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu: &#8220;All praise be to Allaah who rescued the servants from them.&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Nay. I swear by the One in whose Hand my soul is, there are still some of them that remain in the loins of men and verily, there are those amongst them who will be with the Dajjaal. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not respect the sanctity of places or times, as occurred with the Qaraamitah and those who came after them until this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not hold that an oppressive ruler has the right to leadership. [Maqaalaat al-lslaamiyeen (1/204)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fortieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They cling onto the apparent meanings of the Qur&#8217;aanic texts. Even though they don&#8217;t intend to oppose it, however, they understand from it that which the texts do not indicate. Due to this, they have claimed that the prophets committed major and minor sins based on Allaah&#8217;s statement: &#8220;Verily, We have given you a manifest victory &#8211; So that Allaah may forgive you of your past and future sins.&#8221; [Surah Al-Fat&#8217;h: 1-2] So according to them, the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم may commit disbelief then repent. [Al-Khawaarij &#8211; &#8216;Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They reject the Sunnah if there is not some explicit text in the Qur&#8217;aan that supports it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;They do not take anything from the Sunnah except for that which can be interpreted in its general sense, not including those texts that contradict what is apparently stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, according to them. So they do not believe in stoning the fornicator nor do they believe that there is a minimum (stolen) amount, which constitutes stealing.&#8221; [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa (13/48)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They lie in wait on the roads for the purpose of attacking the passers-by and spilling their blood without any justification from Allaah. [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/153) and Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/236) from the speech of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> Not one of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم could be found amongst them (i.e. to support them). [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/150)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> There are many amongst them that differ with one another. This is why they have divided into so many sects, some of which set out to fight against the other and at times, some of which deliver speeches against the other. Allaah spoke truthfully when He said: &#8220;If it (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) were from other than Allaah, you would have found many differences in it.&#8221; [Surah An-Nisaa: 82] [Al- Khawaarij- Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the dogs of the inhabitants of Hell. [Sharh &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1232)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> They outwardly manifest the attributes of calling to good and forbidding evil, redirecting the religious texts concerning that towards disputing with the rulers, rebelling against them and fighting against those who oppose them. [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 22) and Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (P9- 37)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They speak using the speech and words of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin al-Husayn (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;It is not befitting for one who sees the tireless efforts of a Khaarijee that has rebelled against a ruler &#8211; whether just or tyrannical &#8211; thus setting out against him, rallying a group against him, unsheathing swords and deeming it lawful to fight against Muslims &#8211; it is not befitting for him to be deceived by such a person&#8217;s recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan nor by the length of his standing in prayer, nor by his perseverance in fasting, nor by his good words concerning knowledge, so long as he holds the views of the Khawaarij.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They permit oppression against the Prophet M- [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 6933) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Majmoo&#8217;-ul- Fataawaa of Ibn Taimiyyah (19/73)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They use as evidence verses from the Qur&#8217;aan that deal with the wa&#8217;eed (Allaah&#8217;s threat of punishment) while abandoning the verses concerning the wa&#8217;ad (Allaah&#8217;s promise for forgiveness). [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fiftieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They are hasty in applying rulings. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul- Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 146)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They make rulings and accusations against the hearts. This includes issuing rulings on one&#8217;s decisions and notions. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul- Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who has doubts concerning the well-established historical events. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 133)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to illiteracy and they make war against education, claiming that it is not possible to combine between the religious sciences and the practical secular sciences. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 134)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to splitting away from the Muslim community. So they boycott the schools, institutes, universities, government positions and residing with Muslims. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 137)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> From among them is he who believes that a person who holds that the consensus (Ijmaa&#8217;) of the scholars is proof is a disbeliever. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 143)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who disparages the Companions and rejects their statements. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 144)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They oppose those scholars that make blind- following permissible for the common person and the beginner student, claiming that blind-following (taqleed) is a cause for disbelief and the destruction of the nation of Islaam. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 146-147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They kill themselves in suicide operations basing that on false arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] This is a characteristic that is common with all innovators, since they go astray with regard to Allaah&#8217;s unclear verses. They do not try to combine between the clear and unclear verses, as those firmly-grounded in knowledge do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Meaning: They will seek to use evidences from the Book of Allaah but err in their manner of deriving the basis of proof from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Being amazed with oneself is one of the causes that lead the people of innovation astray. And it is one of the pathways that the Devil uses to enter into the affairs of worshippers, Mujaahideen and ascetics, so long as they do not adhere to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] I say: This is with respect to the later ones among them. As for the initial Khawaarij, then they rarely performed analytical deduction. Rather, they would apply their poor understanding to the religious texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] How similar does tonight resemble last night, for everyone that warns against their ways is accused (by them) as regards his Religion. They deem it permissible to fight against the police and security officers who are the cause for maintaining peace and safety.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of the Khawaarij and a Warning against Them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Khawaarij is the plural of Khaarijee, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Guideline for Identifying a Khaarijee:</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or</p>
<p>(2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or</p>
<p>(3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil,</p></blockquote>
<p>then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Origin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the martyrdom of the Muslim Khaleefah, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab رضي الله عنه, the door to fitnah was broken, as is mentioned in the hadeeth. Then with the murder of the third Khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه in 35H, due to a conspiracy from Ibn Saba’ and those who were deluded by him, the fitnah (strife) was re-established – and we continue to see its evil effects up to this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه was given the oath of allegiance as the next Khaleefah after him, and so most of the Muslims gave their pledge of allegiance to him. However, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and those who were with him from the inhabitants of Syria did not give in to that, citing the reason for that as being the obligation of quickly bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee would tell Mu’aawiyah: “Enter into that which the people have entered into (of allegiance). And leave me to judge them. I will judge them with the truth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair رضي الله عنه&nbsp;set out for Basrah upset and seeking justice for the blood of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the <strong>Battle of the Camel</strong>, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه set out to fight against Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and the inhabitants of Syria. This is since he had called them to give the allegiance, however, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه refused to give it, claiming that they must first avenge the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee took this action of Mu’aawiyah as a rebellion against the religious rulership. So there occurred (between the army of the two of them) the <strong>battle of Siffeen</strong>. When ‘Alee and those with him were close to achieving victory, the army of Mu’aawiyah placed copies of the mus-haf high over the tips of their spears and appealed to the Book of Allaah for judgement…’Alee considered this to be a trick on their part, but he was coerced to accept the decision (for peace between the two fighting parties) on the part of some members of his army, especially the Qur’aanic reciters, out of their concern for the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the heels of this legislative decision (between the two factions), there appeared amongst the ranks of ‘Alee’s army some who opposed this decision. This opposition eventually ended up in their disobedience to the ruler and their rebelling against him. Rather, it even led them to declare ‘Alee رضي الله عنه a disbeliever as well as anyone that agreed with his decision. And they raised high their slogan: “There is no rule except for that of Allaah’s.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to reconcile with them by presenting them with arguments and proofs, and some of them returned back due to Ibn ‘Abbaas رضي الله عنه debating with them. So when the advice was not accepted by the remaining individuals that persisted in their rejection and fanaticism, ‘Alee mobilized against them and fought them. [4] This was known as the <strong>battle of Nahrawaan</strong>. ‘Alee رضي الله عنه was able to annihilate all of them except for a small portion among them that escaped to other lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After ‘Alee was murdered at the hands of some members from the Khawaarij, the danger of the Khawaarij increased. The scattered remnants of their army joined forces and spread their poison to the youth of the ummah to the point that they took on the shape of a force within the Islamic state that threatened its security and the security of the unified body of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This group did not cease attacking the Muslims from that time until now, as the Prophet صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم informed us. And they give themselves misleading names, when in reality they are just extensions of the first Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this current time, there have appeared many groups [5] that have adopted the ways and methods of the Khawaarij, and they have accepted many of their ideas and principles. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is one of the beneficial additions from Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan.<br />
[4] So ‘Alee رضي الله عنه did not fight them first, rather, it was only until they first shed innocent blood and commenced fighting with him.<br />
[5] Such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer wal-Hijrah, the Jamaa’ah Tawaqquf wa Tabayyun and other groups.<br />
[6] Such as deeming it permissible to shed unlawful blood and take unlawful wealth under the pretense of Takfeer. This refers to the rebellious and military groups..</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>In the lecture titled:</strong> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/01/07/the-danger-of-isis-upon-the-muslim-ummah-shaykh-muhammad-bin-ramzaan-al-haajiree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Danger of ISIS upon the Muslim Ummah &#8211; 11-03-1436 &#8211; Riyadh &#8211; Shaykh Muhammad bin Ramzaan al-Haajiree</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) told us a story of a young man.  He was a person who was involved in sinning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Normally when a person lives a life like this as soon as be becomes religious, if he lived previously in sin he wants to find the shortest or quickest path to Paradise.  And this individual arrived and sat in their localities.  He was their in their gatherings for 14 day.  One of the big players from them approached him and said:  &#8216;<strong>Ma shaa Allah, Allah has chosen you for a mission to go and blow yourself up</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8216;What?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The big player said: &#8216;We&#8217;ll put an explosive vest and you will go in the midst of these people and blow yourself up killing the kuffar and the apostates.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  They make takfeer for everything!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said:  &#8216;I want Jihaad, I want to fight. I shoot them they shoot me, back and forth, we trade fire, this is what I want.  Blowing myself up…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response of the big player was:  &#8216;Allah has chosen you to be a martyr for shahadah (martyrdom)!&#8217;<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8216;I just came, 14 days.&#8217;  He then asked the big player:  &#8216;How long have you been in Jihaad for?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response of the big player was:  &#8216;I have been in Jihaad for 14 years, when the Americans first came in to Iraaq…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8217;14 years and Allah hasn’t chosen you and 14 days and Allah has chosen me…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the leader saw the response of this young man in front of everybody. He said: &#8216;OK, the affair goes back to you, but we are going to consult amongst us and we will give you the final answer at Maghrib time.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual he recants after he escaped from them.  He knew that the Maghrib time meant that they were going to kill him at Maghrib time.  They would say that you have apostated from Islam and kill him like this. Simple as that!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  &#8216;Cold blooded murder!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said: &#8216;This young man saw them previously saw that they did this to some of the young men there.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said:  &#8216;I&#8217;m dead either way.  If I waited till Maghrib I&#8217;m dead. If I die on the way trying to escape, either way I am going to die!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he found an individual who knew somebody that he knew and this individual understood his circumstances and made easy for him an escape route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  &#8216;And of course he had no paperwork, because when he came he came as a mujahid wanting Paradise so he ripped up all of his paperwork.  Once he reached the border with Turkey, there were individuals who came from the Saudi Embassy and spoke to this individual and now he is being advised…&#8217;<strong> </strong></p>

Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What do you say, may Allah preserve you, about a person who states that the issue of rebelling and opposing the ruler (king, president, government, etc.) is only a matter of Ijtihād (independent, personal interpretation) and says that there is a  difference of opinion regarding the issue among the Salaf. Therefore, it is not permissible  to accuse those who differ in this regard (those who allow political revolution and opposition) of being innovators or sinners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those Who Commit Suicide in the Name of “Jihad” are Actually Followers of Satan<br />
املنتحرون باسم اجلهاد أتباع للشيطان :Original Title<br />
Author: Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān, a member of Saudi Arabia’s council of senior scholars and the Permanent Committee of scholars, describes those who claim they are performing “Jihad” for the sake of Allah by committing suicide are actually fighting for the sake of Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who fall into this type of corruption never sought the council of any Islamic scholars, never learned anything from them. Instead, they isolate themselves from mainstream Muslims and privately accompany people who act as the worst “human idols.” Such people then began brain washing individuals until they eventually harbor enmity towards the public and thus carry out these types of attacks. They consider Muslims to be disbelievers, they murder them, blow up buildings indiscriminately killing both the young and old, male and female, Muslims and those non-Muslims guaranteed safety and living peacefully under Muslim laws (in Muslim nations) – all because of this corrupt ideology.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end result of all those who turn to wicked people for guidance and to the very callers and propagators that the messenger ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) told of when he was asked about certain trials and tribulations that will occur toward the end of time; he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ مَنْ أَطَاعَهُم قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Callers at the doors to Hell; whoever obeys them, they will cast him into it (Hell).</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the state of affairs now and it only confirms this statement of the messenger (.مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ). When such people align themselves with callers to misguidance, those callers lead others into it (misguidance or Hell). Everyone condemns them and hates their actions – both non-Muslims and believers. And no one supports their actions except those like them and those on the same methodology. This issue (of suicide attacks) is certainly a great tribulation and evil, and it is crucial that Muslims carefully understand the issue and not rush to act. Anyone (confused about the issue) should ask the people of religious knowledge to clarify the correct position and then ask Allah for guidance. People should not simply trust others with regards to this issue without knowing the reality of such propagators and whether they are established upon truth or not even though they may outwardly show good conduct, religious fervor, and honor for Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for everyone who outwardly shows good and truth yet is religiously ignorant, we must not hasten to him and give him our trust and reliance until we know the reality of him, his character, and his behavior. This only happens due to giving such a person the benefit of the doubt yet without really looking into his affairs or asking the people of knowledge, intellect, and good advice. As a result, these groups are formed because of people simply hastening to act and because of religious ignorance and mixing with evil people, trusting in them, relying on them and staying away from the mainstream Muslims and their scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Such people (suicide bombers) are always those who avoid religious lessons and the scholars so they naturally fall into these types of things. Similarly, they usually isolate themselves from their families and homes.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent especially on the Muslim youth to take a lesson from such people, for the successful people are those who learn lessons from the actions of others. We must learn from these incidents that we have to stick to our religious limits and stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and not split off from them and turn to others (for guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] This article was published in the Arabic newspaper, “Okaz,” on Thursday, April 23, 2009, issue no. 2867. For the full Arabic text, see: <a href="http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The full text of the ḥadīth is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ḥudhayfah Ibn al-Yamān said: People used to ask Allah’s messenger about good things, but I used to ask him about bad circumstances fearing that I may fall into them. So I said, “Oh messenger of Allah, we used to live in evil during the times before Islam then Allah brought us this good (Islam), so will there be more evil times after these good times?” He ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) replied, “Yes.” I further asked, “And will there then come good after that evil?” He answered, “Yes, but it will be tainted.” I asked, “Why will it be tainted?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» قَوْمٌ يَهْدُوْنَ بِغَيْرِ هَديي، تَعْرِفُ مِنْهُم وَتُنْكِرُ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be people who will guide with other than my guidance. You will recognize some things from them and reject other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, “And will there be after that good even more evil?” He replied:<br />
» نَعَم، دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ، مَنْ أَجَابَهُم إِلَيْهَا قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, there will be callers at the doors of Hell; whoever answers their call, they will cast him into it (Hell).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then said, “Oh messenger of Allah, describe them for us.” He said:<br />
» هُمْ مِنْ جِلْدَتِنَا وَيَتَكَلَّمُوْنَ بَأَلْسِنَتِنَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be from our skin (Arab) and speak our tongue (language). I asked, “So what do you instruct me to do if I reach those times?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» تَلْزِمُ جَمَاعَةَ املُسْلِمِيْنَ وَإِمَامَهُم «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stick with the mainstream group of Muslims and their leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What if there is no main group and no leader?” The prophet ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» فَاعَتَزِلْ تِلْكَ الفِرَقَ كُلَّهَا وَلَوْ أَنْ تَعُضًّ بِأْصِلِ شَجَرَةٍ حَتَّى يُدْرِكُكَ املَوْتُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى ذَلِكَ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the root of a tree and remain in that state until death comes to you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Terrorism: Its Causes &amp; Cures and a Muslim’s Position from Such Tribulations</span></strong><br />
اإلرهاب أسبابه وعالجه وموقف املسلم من الفنت :Original Title<br />
Author: Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Sa’d al-Ṣuḥaymī <em>hafidhahullaah</em><br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allah alone and may He send prayers and peace upon him (Muhammad) after whom there will never be another prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (عزّ وجل) has honored us with the greatest blessing by sending His prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).By him, Allah brought us out of darkness and into light, honoring us by him after our humiliation, and uniting us by him after our division. He made us brothers for the sake of Allah, loving and supporting one another, none having preference over another except by Taqwá as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, the most noble among you with Allah is the one with the most Taqwá (constant fearful consciousness of Allah).</span> [Sūrah al-Ḥujurāt, 49:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, favoring us with this blessing and reminding us of our previous condition before Islam:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (the Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah&#8217;s favor on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His grace, you became brothers. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His signs clear to you, that you may be guided.</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims were living under this great blessing and rejoicing in it during the time of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) until the seed of division was first sown when ‘Abd Allah Ibn Saba and his followers rallied people together against ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنه). However, the very core of the Khawārij first appeared with Dhū al-Khuwaysarah al-Tamīmī when he objected to the way in which the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) distributed the war gains after the battle of Ḥunayn. He (Dhū al-Khuwaysarah) said to him, “Be fair, Muhammad, for you have not been fair!” He also said, “This is, for sure, a distribution by which Allah’s face was not sought!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware. Who would be fair if I would not? Do you not trust me when I am trusted by the One in the heavens?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) wanted to kill him, he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Leave him. There will come from his progeny a people whom you will consider your prayer compared to their prayer as insignificant and your fasting compared to theirs as insignificant. They will recite the Quran, yet it will not go beyond their throats. They will go out of the religion just as an arrow passes through its target.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations were then kindled against ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنه) as the causes of biased factionalism (Ḥizbiyyah) and opposition emerged, casting tribulations and division among the people, striking the very heart of Islam. Its heat was only further increased with the killing of Dhū al-Nūrayn (‘Uthmān)[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]. The matter dangerously worsened and the trials and tribulations increased. Division and discord broke out – at the head of this was the Khawārij sect. They killed ‘Alī and considered the blood of Muslims lawful to spill and their wealth lawful to steal. They caused terror and fear among people, thereby waging war against Allah and His messenger. ‘Alī fought against their evil and, afterwards, found this same Dhū al-Khuwaysarah among those killed from them. They then plotted to kill many of the companions of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and were successful in murdering ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه).</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] Dhū al-Nūrayn literally means “The Possessor of the Two Lights.” He was given this nickname because he married two of the prophet’s daughters, each at different times. – T.N.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, their evil and tribulations have continued up until this day, sometimes apparent, and other times discreet. They will continue in this way right up to the appearance of the Anti-Christ (towards the end of time) just as the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) informed of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Allah had placed in authority of our land, the peninsula, King ‘Abd al-‘Azīz – may Allah grant him prosperity. With him, Allah united the various factions of this nation together after long generations overshadowed with wars and enmity. In those times, ignorance prevailed and tribalism cropped up amongst the people. Many people returned back to Shirk and to the law of the jungle, by which the strong eats the weak. So Allah destined for this leader (King ‘Abd al-‘Azīz) to unite the people under the banner of Tawhīd. Safety and comfort spread. Religious knowledge thrived and the darkness of ignorance dispersed. The brotherhood of Islam prevailed, established upon the actualization of Tawhīd and upon the guidance of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The peninsular was again secured by the supporters of the land. Its children followed in the same footsteps, adhering to this methodology, seeking Allah’s help and applying the rule of Allah in all matters. So safety, security, and well-being prevailed under the rule of Islam. The people of this land were as the heart of a single person – the ruler and the ruled. The young people were firmly connected to their scholars and leaders. They exemplified one united group, not diverse sects; upon one united methodology, and not diverse methodologies. Their unity was strong, far removed from the methodology of extremism. This was manifested by curricula and studies which firmly instill the moderate fundamentals which the Quran and Sunnah call to, as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And thus, We have made you a middle nation.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: a just nation, chosen among other nations. So these lands became a prime example of adhering to the middle path, the path between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there has appeared during these latter times voices, writings, and cries from some insignificant, minor people calling to the shamefulness of biased factionalism. They began to decay the bones of this (Muslim) nation with their invitations away from the unity of a single, interdependent group to the strictness of several diverse sects. They call to the radically choosing of sides and extremism by such ornamented, yet obviously deceptive, means, leading to nothing but division among the ranks of this nation. They try by various ways to persuade some of our young people to their rebellious, revolutionary ideologies which make it possible for the enemies of Islam to take commodities such as oil under the slogan of human rights sometimes, or the call to update and change the school curriculum other times, claiming they are the causes for this very extremism found among such groups and individuals.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The propagation by those with these ideologies to spread their falsehood is done in numerous ways. From these ways are the following:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Belittling the affair of calling to Tawhīd, claiming that the ‘Aqīdah is generally known to most people. Some of them say that it is possible to understand ‘Aqīdah in as little as ten minutes. Rather, some have even stooped so low as to say that this (the persistence in the call to Tawhīd and the correction of ‘Aqīdah) actually causes division amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Turning away from the scholars, abandoning taking knowledge from them, and distorting their statements, claiming they do not fully comprehend the current affairs. They claim the scholars are not qualified to solve the problems facing the Islamic nation today and that they refuse to stand up to face its true issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The distancing of the young people far away from the religious knowledge based on the Quran and Sunnah. They preoccupy them with such things as enthusiastic, fiery Nashīds (so-called “Islamic” songs) or whatever other issues are spread here and there of the various attractive ways, whether written, seen, or by audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The belittlement of the leaders and those in authority and the public exposing of their faults or what some people assume to be their faults. They do this publicly on their pulpits (while delivering lectures in the mosques) and on the questionable satellite channels. They distort the texts commanding the obedience to the leaders to mean that such obedience referred to in these texts is only given to the main leader who has authority over all the Muslims in the world (and not the various individual leaders of each country). They forget, or pretend to forget, that all of the scholars and Imams unanimously agreed that this obedience is also incumbent during times of the existence of various separate Islamic countries. Even though each country may possess its own wealth, with its own rights and obligations dependent upon its respective leader; obedience to such a leader is still an obligation and revolting and rebelling against him is forbidden as long as he establishes the rights of Allah. This is an agreement that all of the scholars of Islam were united upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Rallying together those with these theoretical thoughts who call to revolutionary and rebellious ideas. They assemble the young people, brainwashing them in private gatherings set up in places of rest and recreation. They focus on separating the young people from their scholars and leaders, instead connecting them with personalities that follow methodologies of rebellion and Takfīr (declaring Muslims to be disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They call to their imaginary “Jihad” which is actually the declaring of a Muslim’s blood and wealth to be lawful for the taking. They encourage devastation and bombings and the blowing up of structures property, all the while claiming that the land of the Muslims is now a land of war, fighting being justified therein. This ideology is spread by means such as the inspirational Nashīds. The danger has even reached the level of some youths being trained to use all sorts of weapons in far secluded places within the country, and in other questionable foreign countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The circulation of books, fliers, pamphlets, and cassettes that call to this defiant, radical ideology. They promote making Takfīr, especially against the scholars and leaders. We will mention some of the books that call to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. The writings of Sayyid Qutb. The most dangerous of these are those books that make the blanket Takfīr against most of the Muslim nations in this time, those that defame the Companions of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and even books that defame the Prophets. Examples of these are “Fī Ẓilāl al-Qurān” (In the Shade of the Quran), “Kutub wa Shakhṣiyyāt” (Books and Personalities), “al-‘Adālah al-Ijtimā’iyyah” (Social Justice), and “Ma’ālim fī al-Ṭarīq” (Milestones).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. The books of Sayyid Abul A&#8217;la Maududi.<br />
c. The books of Hassan al-Banna.<br />
d. The books of Sa’īd Hawá.<br />
e. The books of ‘Isām al-‘Iṭār.<br />
f. The books of Abū al-Fatḥ al-Bayānūnī.<br />
g. The books of Muḥammad Ibn ‘Alī al-Ṣābūnī.<br />
h. The books of Muḥammad Ḥasan Hanbakah al-Maydānī.<br />
i. The books of of al-Turābī.<br />
j. The books of al-Ḥuḍaybī.<br />
k. The books of al-Tilmisānī.<br />
l. The books of Aḥmad Muḥammad al-Rāshid (a pen name). The most dangerous of his books are “al-Maṣār” (The Path), al-‘Awā`iq (The Obstacles), “al-Munṭaliq” (The Starting Point, or Liberated), and “al-Raqā`iq”.<br />
m. The books of ‘Iṣām al-Bashīr.<br />
n. The books, pamphlets, and tapes of Muḥammad Surūr Zayn al-‘Ābidīn, the head of the Muntaḍá organization in London.<br />
o. Other books than these mentioned that are widespread in our bookstores that are filled with this ideology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is incumbent for us to dry up this fountain (of deviation) by warning against these books, preventing their circulation, and by supervising those publishing companies and bookstores who are lenient in distributing these books or selling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these books are read by young people whose own ideas have not yet matured and who have no knowledge-based protection against the effects of such books, they (such books) corrupt their intellect, and ideas, causing them to follow fantasies. This way, the youth are prepared to carry out whatever is requested of them – even something like suicide or the killing of others from among Muslims or non-Muslims that should be guaranteed safety. They do such things to achieve a certain objective – “martyrdom for the sake of Allah and the triumph of entering paradise.” These theorists have made the youth imagine that this is the correct way leading to this destination and to the victory of gaining Allah’s pleasure. So Takfīr, bombings, mass destruction in the lands of Muslims, and abandoning the methodology of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ) have all now become “the path of guidance” as perceived by such people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Another way that such deviant ideologies have spread is by the emergence of inspirational activists from these groups of Takfīr such as the sect “al-Ikhwān alMuslimūn,” or the “Muslim Brotherhood” and other groups that originated from them that are found in our schools, institutes, and universities. They have distorted and transformed many of our children by planting and cultivating among them the methodology of Takfīr by student get-togethers and recreational trips as well as with exaggerated religious narrations and those containing blatant lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means by which these people were successful in corrupting many of our youth, making them unaware of the correct methodology, their scholars, and their leaders. They made the truth appear to them to be only what they themselves were upon and everyone else was upon nothing (of guidance). The negligence of realizing these means by which they use has allowed this alien ideology to spread in our religion and nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now comes the question: “How do we protect our youth from this?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To safeguard from such innovated ideologies of Takfīr, we must individually and collectively take the following steps:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Call the youth back to adherence to the Quran and Sunnah and to refer back to them both under all circumstances. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (the Quran), and be not divided among yourselves.</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if you differ in anything, its decision is for Allah.</span>[Sūrah al-Shūrá, 42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So referring back to the Book of Allah and adhering to it is the protection and the foundation by which Allah preserves one from falling into destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. We must make sure to understand the Quran and Sunnah according to the methodology of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ). This will not be achieved unless the Muslims seek such understanding from the sincere and knowledgeable scholars who, by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), they refute the distortion of the extremists, the false assumptions of the deniers, and the misinterpretations of the ignorant ones. Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاسْأَلُواْ أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So ask the people of the scripture if you don’t know.</span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā’, 21:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">أُوْلِي الأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If there comes to them a matter of safety or fear, they (immediately) publicize it. If only they had referred it to the messenger and to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The terrorists are those who spread corruption on earth, following religious verdicts given without knowledge. They are those who shun the listening to the main scholars of the nation, describing them with evil characteristics that are more rightly attributed to these terrorists themselves. So if the youth turn instead to the inheritors of prophethood (the major scholars), those who are firmly-grounded in knowledge, then this will be their defense, if Allah wills, against these terrorists who rant and rave about things they know nothing about, spreading false rumors. They claim there is no other place for the youth to turn to and connect themselves with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. We must also remain far away from the places of such Fitnah (trials, afflictions, and tribulations) to avoid their evil effects. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاتَّقُواْ فِتْنَةً لاَّ تُصِيبَنَّ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنكُمْ خَآصَّةً</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And fear the Fitnah which not only afflicts those among you who do wrong particularly (but may rather afflict everyone)</span>. [Sūrah al-Anfāl, 8:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by taking the initiative to do righteous deeds by which Allah’s servants protect themselves against the Fitnah. The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Take the initiative to do righteous deeds before a Fitnah comes like patches of a dark night. Due to it, a man will be a believer at night and disbelieve by morning, or be a believer in the morning and disbelieve by nightfall. He will sell his religion for a mere portion of this worldly life.”</span> [Imam Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) said that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There will come a Fitnah during which the one who sits will be better than the one who stands, and the one who stands will be better than the one who walks, the one who walks will be better than one who runs. Whoever exposes himself to it will be overcome by it. Whoever finds a refuge or resort (from it) then let him seek it for protection.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. We must strive in worshipping Allah and try to remain constantly and fearfully conscious of Him (عزّ وجل) – having Taqwá. This is done by carrying out what He has commanded and remaining away from what He has forbidden. This is the way of success from every hardship as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْرًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever has Taqwá of Allah, He will make his affairs easy for him</span>.[Sūrah al-Ṭalāq, 65:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">َمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever has Taqwá of Allah, He will make for him a way to get out (of every difficulty).</span> [Sūrah al-Ṭalāq, 65:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having this Taqwá of Allah, remaining firm on His legislation, and performing deeds that please Him is the way to achieve every success and victory in both lives (this life and the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. We must stop the widespread open sinning amongst ourselves, because whatever of Fitnah, evils, or disagreements that afflict the Muslims, it only stems from sins becoming prevalent among the people and disobedience to Allah. Whatever calamities afflict them is only due to what they themselves have earned as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَلَمَّا أَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُم مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّى هَـذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When a disaster afflicts you, although you struck (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: “From where does this come to us?” Say, “It is from your own selves (because of your evil deeds).”</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي النَّاسِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned (by sins, evil deeds, etc.).</span> [Sūrah al-Rūm, 30:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. We must stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and we must reinforce the understanding that it is obligatory to obey those in authority in goodness. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَطِيعُواْ اللّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ الرَّسُولَ وَأُوْلِي الأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, obey Allah and obey the messenger, and those who are in authority among you.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed, Allah is pleased for you three things and is displeased with three things. He is pleased for you that you worship Him without associating anything as partners with Him, that you hold all together to the rope of Allah and not split into groups, and that you give sincere advice to whomever Allah puts in charge of your affairs.”</span> [Muslim &amp; Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There are three things which the heart of a Muslim should never object to: sincerity in doing deeds solely for the sake of Allah, giving sincere advice to those in authority of affairs, and sticking to the main body of Muslims.”</span> [Ibn Mājah &amp; Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever sees something from his leader which he hates, then let him be patient with it, for indeed the one who splits away from the group by even a hand-span and then dies, he does not die except the death of Jāhiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance).”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī also records in his authentic collection a long Ḥadīth from Ḥudhayfah (رضي الله عنه) in which he asks the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p>“What do you instruct me to do if that (Fitnah) reaches me?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Stick to the main group of Muslims and their leader.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Ḥudhayfah) further asked, “What if there is neither a main group nor a leader?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Then stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the trunk of a tree until death comes to you while you are in that state.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Seeking help by remaining patient during times of hardship. Patience extinguishes much Fitnah as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلاَةِ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient ones.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاصْبِرْ عَلَى مَا أَصَابَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And bear with patience whatever may befall you</span>.[Sūrah Luqmān, 31:17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The affair of a believer is amazing – all of his affairs are good for him. If he experiences good, he is thankful and that is good for him. And when hardship befalls him, he is patient and that is good for him. This is not the case of anyone except a believer.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We have to resolve our issues with tolerance and forbearance and not be so hasty in judging and passing religious verdicts. We must refrain from becoming excited and angry – all of these traits are the characteristics of the Prophets and Messengers and their followers. Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, Ibraaheem (Prophet Abraham) was certainly forbearing, humbly invoking (Allah), and repentant.</span>[Sūrah Hūd, 11:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said to Ashajj Banī ‘Abd al-Qays:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There are two qualities within you that Allah and His messenger love: tolerance and forbearance.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. We must adorn ourselves with gentleness, good behavior among ourselves, and kindness when resolving our problems. The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Gentleness is not in anything except that it beautifies it and it is not removed from anything except that it renders it defective.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed, Allah loves kindness and gentleness in all matters.”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. We must fully comprehend whatever issues face us as they actually are, understanding and perceiving them and delve deep into their root causes. We must give this great significance because any ruling passed on a matter is greatly dependant upon how that matter is first understood. So a Muslim should not be misled by only the outward appearance of any issue. Rather, it is incumbent upon a believer to be careful of everything happening around him and not be deceived by first impressions. This must be done, however, by confirming the evidences and without leaving the true methodology. Passing rulings and judgments must not be rushed into and religious issues must not be delved into with no basis of knowledge as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلاَ تَقْفُ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ إِنَّ السَّمْعَ وَالْبَصَرَ وَالْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُولـئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْؤُولاً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow that of which you have no knowledge. Certainly, the hearing, sight, and heart – of each of those you will be questioned.</span> [Sūrah al-Isrā’, 17:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. We must confirm and verify anything we hear and not simply give an ear to rumors, especially what is broadcast on the various media means and the questionable satellite channels. Often such announcements result in commotion among the Muslims, causing them to differ in their goals and weaken their unity. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن جَاءكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَأٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا أَن تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَى مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, if a wicked evil person comes to you with news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.</span> [Sūrah al-Ḥujurāt, 49:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of suspicion, for suspicion if the most deceitful of speech.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. We have to return back to the fundamentals of our faith and our religion when passing any judgments of others as being disbelievers, sinners, or innovators. We only make such rulings based on the criteria found in the Quran and Sunnah. We do not pass a blanket ruling of disbelief on Muslims without deliberation and confirmed evidence due to the seriousness of this matter. It is forbidden for a Muslim to accuse his brother, a specific individual Muslim, of being a disbeliever even if he does an action of disbelief, unless and until all of the applicable conditions have been met and all excuses and explanations have been removed. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ أَلْقَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلاَمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ اللّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">كَذَلِكَ كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ اللّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, when you go in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you with peace: “You are not a believer,” thereby seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and goods with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before Allah conferred on you His favors (guided you to Islam). therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is ever well aware of what you do.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also warned against this saying in the Ḥadīth of Abū Dharr (رضي الله عنه):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“No man accuses another of being a sinner or accuses him of disbelief except that it is applied back to himself if his companion is actually not like that.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abd Allah Ibn ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه) narrated that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Any man that says to his brother, ‘Oh disbeliever!’ then it falls back to one of them.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Daqīq al-‘Īd says regarding the meaning of this Ḥadīth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a sever threat to the one who accuses anyone of the Muslims as being a disbeliever while he is really not. It is a very serious matter in which many of the speakers have fallen into and others who falsely ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and the people of Ḥadīth. This is because of their differing in the correct ‘Aqīdah beliefs so they are harsh with those who oppose them, judging them as disbelievers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous scholar of Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah, endorsed this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I’m one of the harshest persons in forbidding one from accusing a specific individual of disbelief, wickedness, or sin unless he knows for certain that all the religious proofs and evidences have been established upon him – those proofs indicating that whoever opposes them is in fact a disbeliever, defiantly disobedient one, or a sinner. And I also affirm that Allah may choose to forgive the sins of this entire (Muslim) nation, the spoken sins and mistakes and the actions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the issues that every Muslim must pay close attention to during such depressing times of trials and tribulations. And it is incumbent upon all Muslims, individually and collectively, the rulers and the ruled, the scholars and students, to consolidate their efforts in order to eradicate these tribulations, uprooting them from their very origins especially today’s problems of Takfīr which have led some people to the extent of accepting that other Muslims’ blood and wealth are lawful to take. Such people corrupt others to the point that they are willing to carry out such measures as of destruction, and bombings. They do this by means of questionable organizations, paid publications, and misguiding verdicts which lead to such terrifying incidents carried out by people with stupid misconceptions. Thereby, they convert themselves into corruptors, murderers of Muslims and non-Muslims who have been promised safety. They violate the sanctity of others’ wealth and structures, calling this “Jihad.” This is the age-old crime of naming something with other than its true name…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every single Muslim is required, as much as he can, to expose their (the terrorists’) lies and to make known their deviation to prevent their evil and corruption from spreading and calamity from dangerously worsening. It is forbidden to hide or conceal anyone of them because this would be cooperating with them in sin and transgression and Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الْبرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلاَ تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الإِثْمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And cooperate together in righteous and Taqwá, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.</span> [Sūrah al-Māi’dah, 5:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever supports and accommodates them, defends them, or accepts there actions, then he shares in the sin of killing innocent souls who have committed no crime deserving of this from among the Muslims and those who are under the trust of safety from among the non-Muslims living in the Muslim lands. The Ḥadīth of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is applied to such supporters of them when he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The curse of Allah is upon anyone who supports an innovator.”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Generous, the Lord of the great throne, by His perfect names and by His magnificent attributes to preserve and protect all the Muslims in general, and these (Muslim) lands in particular – their religion, safety, and security. And we ask Him to guide the misguided ones from the Muslims and return them back to their religion with a goodly return. We ask Him to unite them all in their goals upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last of our call is that all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of all creations and may He send prayers and peace upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">فتاوى نور على الدرب :Original Title<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5;">Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Sudanese brothers living in the kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) in the city of Bāḥah asks: The people of the Sunnah and the mainstream community of Muslims state that the final destination of those who worship Allah with <em>Tawḥīd</em> – the Muslim monotheists – will eventually be Paradise. Yet there have come examples in some <em>ḥadīth </em>(prophetic narrations) that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ قَاطِعُ رَحْم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ نَمَّامٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“A slanderer will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, will the Muslim monotheists who happen to fall into these two groups never enter Paradise as is apparent from these texts, or how do we understand them?</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts pertaining to threats and others similar to them, whether from <em>ḥadīth</em> or verses of the Qur&#8217;aan, are what led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/">Khawārij</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/">Mu’tazilah</a> </strong>sects to state that anyone who commits a major sin will remain forever in the fire (of Hell). This is because they take these general texts and forget other general ones that conflict (and must be taken along) with these. And there are many proofs that state that Muslim monotheists or those with faith in their hearts even equal to a seed’s worth will not remain in the fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the generality of the texts pertaining to hopes and promises that mention that believers will enter Paradise led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/">Murjiah</a> </strong>sect to disregard the texts of threats. They said that any believer, even if he were a wicked sinner, would never enter the fire. So, these people take only these general texts and those others sects take only the general texts of threats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allah has guided the people of the Sunnah and the main community of Muslims to the middle, moderate belief that combines the understanding of both evidences in conjunction. This belief is that someone who commits a major sin does not thereby completely leave his faith. He may be deserving of punishment but Allah could simply forgive him and not put him into the fire, or perhaps someone else could pray for him and as a result Allah may not punish him. His punishment could also be expiated by other means. However, if no means are present whereby he can avoid punishment, then he may be punished in the fire according to the extent of his action, and after that he would be in Paradise. This is the methodology and understanding of the people of Sunnah and the community of mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, the general <em>ḥadīth</em> of threats like those the questioner mentioned: “<span style="color:#808000;">Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise</span>,” and “<span style="color:#808000;">A slanderer will not enter Paradise</span>,” <span style="color:#0000ff;">are understood to mean that such people will not enter Paradise by a perfect, absolute entrance without punishment</span>. Rather, punishment may precede that (his entrance to Paradise) if nothing wipes out that sin like Allah’s forgiveness or something else. So the meaning is he will not enter Paradise absolutely and perfectly without some sort of punishment preceding that; by this meaning all the evidences are understood together (with no contradiction).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As sallamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago (13<sup>th</sup> Ramadaan), in the masjid of the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi  wa sallam</i>) in Medina, in his explanation of Usool-us-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad, Sheikh Saaleh bin Sa’d as-Suhaymee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“My brothers, do not forget your brothers in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and in every place in your supplications because of these well-known conspiracies which have been agreed upon by all from amongst the disbelievers from the Jews and the Christians, the hizb-ul-Iblees (the party of Iblees), the Raafidah and other than them. They are agreed upon in concocting these conspiracies to divert the Muslims away from Tawheed and to put them to trial and so that they can reach their goals of completely eradicating the Muslims of Ahlus-Sunnah. </b><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <b>However, they will bring in loss (upon themselves) – by the permission of Allah – whether it is the Jews and the Christians of the west and the east, or the party of Iblees, or the Raafidah or those who conspire with them against Ahlus-Sunnah, or the Khawaarij or other than them. All of these (groups) will come to an end – by the permission of Allah. Every time a tentacle from amongst them appears, it will be cut off, and Allah will cut off their tentacles – by the permission of Allah, The Most High&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then stressed the importance of the Muslims returning back to Allah and to have reliance upon Him alone. He mentioned how the day before someone in Gaza had even called upon Salaah-ud-Deen al-Ayubee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) to help them and that this is the very essence of Shirk. The Sheikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“How do you expect to be rescued (from these trials) whilst you are calling upon other than Allah?”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then advised the Muslims to call upon Allah alone and not upon anyone else, including the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi wa sallam</i>). He then supplicated for the destruction of all these groups, whether it is the ‘devils’ of the Khawaarij and The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, or the ‘devils’ of the Jews and the Christians in the east and the west or the ‘devils’ of the Raafidah or the hizb of Iblees. He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“&#8230;By Allah, the Jews and the Christians and the west and the east are not the enemies of the Raafidah. They are not the enemies of the Khawaarij. They are the ones who brought them in, they are the ones who armed them and they are the ones who sold weapons to them. This is because the goal which they have in mind is to completely eradicate Ahlus-Sunnah, the Salafees, Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jammah. However, they will bring in loss, failure and disappointment (upon themselves) by the permission of Allah, The Most Merciful&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transcription of the Sheikh’s words can be found at:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah save the Muslims from the conspiracies of the Jews and Christians, the Raafidah and the Khawaarij. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are the Terrorists of Today the Khawārij?<br />
هؤالء املفجرين ال شك أنهم خوارج :Original Title<br />
Author: Ṣāliḥ al-Fawzān<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison &#8211; <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#800000;">The questioner asks about this group that has today left the Muslims and opposed them. They carry out bombings and terrorize people who once felt safe. Are these people truly part of the Khawārij or are they disbelievers?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: This group that has left the Muslims, rebelling against them – this is the result of disassociating oneself from the scholars. I mentioned the consequences of this during the last part of the (previous) lecture. They broke away from the scholars, broke away from the Muslim leaders, and the disbelievers and hypocrites put these ideologies into their heads. So, they have become outcasts in Muslim societies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are Khawārij, no doubt. This act of theirs is the act of the Khawārij. <strong>Rather, they are even more violent and extreme than the (original) Khawārij.</strong> The (past) Khawārij did not use to destroy buildings and residents. The Khawārij used to show up face-to-face on the battlefield. They used to fight on the battlefield despite what they were upon of ignorance. But they did not used to collapse buildings on everyone inside them – women, children, the innocent, those at peace with Muslims, people with whom Muslims have a treaty, and other people guaranteed safety. The Khawārij used not to do this. This is worse and more violent than the actions of the (original) Khawārij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is more like the actions of the <strong>Qarāmiṭah (a severely violent, misguided sect)</strong>. They are more like the Qarāmiṭah because the actions of the Qarāmiṭah are secret, based on secrecy and underhandedness and what these people today do is also based on secrecy. The (former) Khawārij – their actions were not kept hidden and secret; they would make themselves and their objectives known, publicly announcing them. <strong>So, these people are even worse than Khawārij.</strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Dogs of Hell</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Aḥmad, Ibn Mājah, and al-Ḥākim recorded a Ḥadīth from Ibn Abī Awfá, and Aḥmad and al-Ḥākim also recorded it from Abū Umāmah that the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الخَوَارِجُ كِلابُ النَّارِ<br />
“The Khawārij are the dogs of Hell.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawārij are a sect of people who innovate and follow beliefs and practices foreign to Islam. They are called that (derived from the Arabic root verb: خَرَجَ &#8211; meaning to exit or rebel against) for their leaving the religion and for their rebellion against the best Muslims (prophet Muhammad’s companions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawārij used to renounce ‘Uthmān (the third Caliph of Islam) for several things and they declared themselves free of him announced their disassociation from him. The origin of that was that some of the citizens of Iraq criticized the behavior of some of ‘Uthmān’s relatives, so they blamed ‘Uthmān for that. Those people were known as “Reciters” for their diligence in reciting the Quran and for their worship. Yet, they used to twist and misinterpret the Quran from its intended meanings. They used to persist on their own personal opinions, and they used to appear very strict and devout in their humility, their renouncement of worldly things, and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After ‘Uthmān was killed, they fought alongside ‘Alī. They believed ‘Uthmān was a disbeliever and whoever follows him. They considered ‘Alī’s leadership to be legitimate and considered anyone who fought against him to be disbelievers – those who fought him during the Battle of the Camel when their leaders were Ṭalḥah and al-Zubayr. [2] Yet when ‘Alī made a peace agreement regarding the leadership with Mu’āwiyah, they then declared ‘Alī to be a disbeliever and revolted against him, so he fought them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are the Worst of People, the Worst of All Creatures</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aḥmad, Muslim, and Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Dharr who narrated that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ بَعْدِي مِنْ أُمَّتِي أَوْ سَيَكُونُ بَعْدِي مِنْ أُمَّتِي قَوْمٌ يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ<br />
حَلاقِيمَهُمْ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَخْرُجُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ ثُمَّ لا يَعُودُونَ<br />
فِيهِ هُمْ شَرُّ الْخَلْقِ وَالْخَلِيقَةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will definitely be a people after me from my nation who recite the Quran yet it will not even reach beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a target, then they will not return back to it. They are the worst of people, the worst of all creatures.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Ṣāmit, who narrated the Ḥadīth from Abū Dharr, said, “I met Rāfi’ Ibn ‘Amr al- Ghifārī and asked him about this Ḥadīth of Abū Dharr. He said, “I (too) heard it from Allah’s messenger ( [3] ”.(صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Anti-Christ Will Emerge Among Them</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth from Ibn ‘Umar ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا ) that the messenger of Allah صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَنْشَأُ نَشْءٌ يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ كُلَّمَا خَرَجَ قَرْنٌ قُطِعَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will arise a group of people who will recite the Quran but it will not reach beyond their throats. Every time a new generation of them rises, they will then disappear.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar said, “I heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) say, ‘Every time a new generation of them rises, they will then disappear,’ more than twenty times and then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ فِي عِرَاضِهِمْ الدَّجَّالُ<br />
“Until the Anti-Christ finally appears among them.” [4]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are the Worst of People Killed; The Best are Those Whom they Kill</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth in which Abū Umāmah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">شَرُّ قَتْلَى قُتِلُوا تَحْتَ أَدِيمِ السَّمَاءِ وَخَيْرُ قَتِيلٍ مَنْ قَتَلُوا كِلَابُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ قَدْ<br />
كَانَ هَؤُلَاءِ مُسْلِمِينَ فَصَارُوا كُفَّارًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“(They are) the worst people killed under the sky, and the best people killed are those whom they kill. They are the dogs of Hell. These people used to be Muslims but they became disbelievers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Abū Ghālib, one of the narrators) asked, “Abū Umāmah, is this something only you yourself are saying?” He replied, “No, rather I heard it from the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى 5 ”.(اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Their Distinguishing Signs on the Day of Nahrawān</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī and Muslim both recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) who said, “We were with Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) while he was distributing some wealth. Dhu al-Khuwaṣirah, a man from the Tamīm tribe, came to him and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, be fair!’ The prophet replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَيْلَكَ وَمَنْ يَعْدِلُ إِذَا لَمْ أَعْدِلْ قَدْ خِبْتَ وَخَسِرْتَ إِنْ لَمْ أَكُنْ أَعْدِلُ<br />
“Beware. And who would be fair if I was not? You would be ruined if I were not just.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar said, “Messenger of Allah, allow me to strike his neck.” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">دَعْهُ فَإِنَّ لَهُ أَصْحَابًا يَحْقِرُ أَحَدُكُمْ صَلاتَهُ مَعَ صَلاتِهِمْ وَصِيَامَهُ مَعَ صِيَامِهِمْ<br />
يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ<br />
الرَّمِيَّةِ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى نَصْلِهِ فَلا يُوجَدُ فِيهِ شَيْءٌ ثُمَّ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى رِصَافِهِ فَمَا يُوجَدُ فِيهِ<br />
شَيْءٌ ثُمَّ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى نَضِيِّهِ وَهُوَ قِدْحُهُ فَلا يُوجَدُ فِيهِ شَيْءٌ ثُمَّ يُنْظَرُ إِلَى قُذَذِهِ فَلا<br />
يُوجَدُ فِيهِ شَيْءٌ قَدْ سَبَقَ الْفَرْثَ وَالدَّمَ آيَتُهُمْ رَجُلٌ أَسْوَدُ إِحْدَى عَضُدَيْهِ مِثْلُ<br />
ثَدْيِ الْمَرْأَةِ أَوْ مِثْلُ الْبَضْعَةِ تَدَرْدَرُ وَيَخْرُجُونَ عَلَى حِينِ فُرْقَةٍ مِنْ النَّاسِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Leave him. He will certainly have companions (from his progeny) whom one of you would belittle his own prayer when compared to their prayer and his fasting compared to their fasting. They will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a game animal. One could then look at the arrowhead and not see a thing remaining on it. He could look at the binding which attaches the arrowhead to the rod and not see a thing. He could look at the rod and not see a thing. He could look at the feathers and not see a thing. It would go straight through the bowels and blood. Their sign is that of a black man. One of his limbs will appear like a woman’s breast or a disfigured lump of flesh. They will emerge when the people are disunited.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Sa’īd said, “I testify that I indeed heard this Ḥadīth from Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ), and I testify that ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib fought them while I was with him. He instructed that we search for that man. He was found and ‘Alee was brought to him. I saw that man exactly as the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) described him.” [6]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They Murder the People of Islam and Ignore the People of Idol-Worship</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Abū Dāwūd, and al-Nasā`ī all recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al- Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) sent some gold to the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) so divided and distributed it among four groups: al-Aqra’ Ibn Ḥābis al-Ḥanẓalī, al-Mujāshi’ī, ‘Uyaynah Ibn Badr al-Fazārī, and Zayd al-Ṭā`ī; a man from the Nabhān tribe and ‘Alqamah Ibn ‘Ulāthah al-‘Āmirī; then a man from the Kilāb tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Muslims of) Quraysh and the residents of Medina became upset and said, “He gives to the noble one from Najd and leaves us?” The prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ<br />
وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّمَا أَتَأَلَّفُهُمْ<br />
“I am only trying to unite their hearts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a man with sunken eyes, thick cheeks, a high forehead, a thick beard, and a shaven head came up and said, “Fear Allah, Muhammad!” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">مَنْ يُطِعْ اللَّهَ إِذَا عَصَيْتُ؟ أَيَأْمَنُنِي اللَّهُ عَلَى أَهْلِ الأَرْضِ فَلا تَأْمَنُونِي؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who would obey Allah if I were disobedient (to Him)? Allah trusts me with regards to the people of the earth but you don’t trust me?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man then asked to kill him – I think it was Khālid Ibn al-Walīd – but the prophet صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) forbade him from doing so. After the man left, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ مِنْ ضِئْضِئِ هَذَا أَوْ فِي عَقِبِ هَذَا قَوْمًا يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ حَنَاجِرَهُمْ<br />
يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ مُرُوقَ السَّهْمِ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ يَقْتُلُونَ أَهْلَ الإِسْلامِ وَيَدَعُونَ أَهْلَ<br />
الأَوْثَانِ لَئِنْ أَنَا أَدْرَكْتُهُمْ لأَقْتُلَنَّهُمْ قَتْلَ عَادٍ</p>

If I were to reach them (their time), I would destroy them like the people of ‘Ād were destroyed.” [7]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Their Sign is Their Shaven Heads</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Aḥmad, al-Bukhārī, and Muslim recorded a Ḥadīth from Sahl Ibn Ḥanīf who narrated that the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ مِنَ المَشْرِقِ أَقْوَامٌ مُحَلَّقَةٌ رُءُوسُهُمْ، يَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ لا يَعْدُو<br />
تَرَاقِيَهُمْ، يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ الدِّينِ كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنْ الرَّمِيَّةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A people will emerge from the East having shaven heads. They will recite the Quran with their tongues but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion just as an arrow passes through a target.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aḥmad and al-Bukhārī record a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī that Allah’s messenger صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ نَاسٌ مِنْ قِبَلِ الْمَشْرِقِ وَيَقْرَءُونَ الْقُرْآنَ لا يُجَاوِزُ تَرَاقِيَهُمْ يَمْرُقُونَ مِنْ<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">“People will emerge from the East who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through a target, and they will not return to it until an arrow returns to its bow.” It was asked, “What is their distinguishing sign?” He answered:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Ṭabarānī recorded a Ḥadīth from ‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Āmir from Sahl Ibn Ḥanīf who narrated that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سَيَخْرُجُ قَوْمٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَشْرَبُوْنَ القُرْآنَ كَشُرْبِهِم اللَّبَن</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dāwūd, and al-Ḥākim recorded a Ḥadīth narrated by both Abū Sa’īd and Anas in which the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي اخْتِلافٌ وَفُرْقَةٌ ، قَوْمٌ يُحْسِنُونَ الْقِيلَ وَيُسِيئُونَ الْفِعْلَ ،<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will appear within my nation differences and division – people who will perfect their speech and make evil their actions. They will recite the Quran but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion just as an arrow passes through a target and they will not return until it (the arrow) returns back to its bow. They are the worst of people, the worst of all creatures. Tūbá (a tree in paradise, success) is for whoever kills them or they kill him. They will call to the book of Allah yet they have nothing to do with it. Whoever fights against them has more right upon Allah than they do.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions asked, “What is their sign?” He replied:</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Their Religious Actions Amaze Some People</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Ibn Mājah recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) who said that he heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ فِيكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَحْقِرُونَ صَلاتَكُمْ مَعَ صَلاتِهِمْ وَصِيَامَكُمْ مَعَ صِيَامِهِمْ<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will emerge among you people whom you would belittle your prayer when compared to their prayer, your fasting compared to their fasting, and your deeds compared to theirs. They will recite the Quran but it will not reach beyond their throats. They will pass right through the religion just as an arrow may pass right through a target (game animal). One may look at such an arrowhead and see nothing remaining. He may look at the arrow rod and see nothing remaining. He may look at the feathers and see nothing. And he may look at the end-notch (to see if anything of blood stuck to it).” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim recorded in “Kitāb al-Sunnah” a Ḥadīth narrated by Anas Ibn Mālik ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) in which he said: It was narrated to me that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ فِيْكُمْ – أَوْ يَكُوْنُ فِيْكُمْ – قَوْمٌ يَتَعَبَّدُوْنَ وَيَتَدَيَّنُوْنَ حَتَّى يُعْجِبُوْكُمْ<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will emerge among you – or (he said) there will be among you &#8211; a people who will worship and be religious so much that they will amaze you and amaze themselves. They will pass right through the religion just as an arrow may pass right through a target.” [14]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are the Māriqūn (They Pass Right through the Religion)</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bazzār recorded, as did Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim in “Kitāb al-Sunnah,” a narration that ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said on the Day of al-Nahrawān:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أُمِرْتُ بِقِتَالِ المَارِقِيْنَ، وَهَؤُلاءِ المَارِقُوْنَ</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim and Abū Dāwūd recorded a Ḥadīth from Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) who said that the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">تَمْرُقُ مَارِقَةٌ عِنْدَ فِرْقَةٍ مِنَ المُسْلِمِيْنَ، يَقْتُلُهَا أَوْلَى الطَّائِفَتَيْنِ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A group of Māriqah will renegade when the Muslims will split (the party of ‘Alī and that of Muā’wiyah); the closer of the two parties to the truth will kill them (the Māriqah).” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration recorded by Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">تَكُوْنَ فِي أُمَّتِي فِرْقَتَانِ، فَتَخْرُجٌ مِنْ بَيْنِهِمَا مَارِقَةٌ، يَلِي قَتْلَهُمْ أَوْلاهُمْ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will be in my nation two parties. Between them, a group of Māriqah will emerge. The closer of the two parties to the truth will kill them.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Nawawī said in his explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These narrations are explicit in that ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) was correct, and the other party, the companions of Muā’wiyah ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ), were mistaken in their interpretations. And in these narrations, it is clear that both parties still remained believers; they did not, because of their fighting one another, leave their faith nor are they considered wicked.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Tamiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And we know that ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) was better and closer to the truth than Muā’wiyah and those who fought against him with Muā’wiyah. This is confirmed by the narration in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī and Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim that Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said that the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">تَمْرُقُ مَارِقَةٌ عِنْدَ فِرْقَةٍ مِنَ المُسْلِمِيْنَ، يَقْتُلُهَا أَوْلَى الطَّائِفَتَيْنِ بِالْحَقِّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A group of Māriqah will renegade when the Muslims will split; the closer of the two parties to the truth will kill them (the Māriqah).” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in this Ḥadīth, there is evidence that both parties had something of truth with it, but that ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) was closer to the truth.” [20]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Encouragement of Allah’s Messenger صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم to Defeat them &amp; the Reward for Doing So</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Abū Dāwūd recorded a narration in which ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When I speak to you, narrating to you something that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) said, I would rather fall from the sky than to lie upon him. And if speak to you about what is happening between you and I, then surely in war there may be misleading strategy. Yet, I heard the messenger of Allah ( (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَأْتِي فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ قَوْمٌ حُدَثَاءُ الأَسْنَانِ، سُفَهَاءُ الأَحْلامِ، يَقُوْلُوْنَ مِنْ قَوْلِ خَيْرِ<br />
البَرِيَّةِ، يَمْرُقُوْنَ مِنَ الإِسْلامِ كَمَا يَمْرُق السَّهْمُ مِنَ الرَّمِيَّةِ، لا يُجَاوِزُ إِيْمَانُهُم<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will come towards the end of time a people who will be young in age, having reckless and deficient intellects. They will speak with the statements of the best of creation, yet they will pass through Islam just as an arrow passes through a target. Their faith will not even reach beyond their throats. Wherever you find them, kill them, for whoever kills them will have a reward on the Day of Resurrection. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Muslim also narrated that Salamah Ibn Kuhīl said: Zayd Ibn Wahb al-Juhanī told me that he was among the army under the command of ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) that went out to fight the Khawārij. ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh people, indeed I heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَخْرُجُ قَوْمٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَقْرَءُوْنَ القُرْآنَ، لَيْسَ قِرَاءَتُكُم إِلَى قِرَاءَتِهِم بِشَيْءٍ، وَلا<br />
صَلاتُكُم إِلَى صَلاتِهِم بِشَيْءٍ، وَلاصِيَامُكُم إِلَى صِيَامِهِم بِشَيْءٍ، يَقْرَءُوْنَ القَرْآنَ،<br />
يَحْسِبُوْنَ أَنَّهُ لَهُم وَهُوَ عَلَيْهٍم، لاتُجَاوِزُ صَلاتُهُم تَرَاقِيَهُم، يَمْرُقُوْنَ مِنَ الإِسْلامِ<br />
كَمَا يَمْرُقُ السَّهْمُ مِنَ الرَّمِيَّةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will arise a people from my nation, those who will recite the Quran; your recitation is nothing (insignificant) compared to theirs, your prayer is nothing compared to theirs, and your fasting is nothing compared to theirs. They recite the Quran believing it is evidence in support of them yet it is actually against them. Their prayers will not even go beyond their throats. They will pass through and out of Islam just as an arrow passes through a target.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(‘Alī continued:) “If the army that is to encounter them were to know what (rewards) have been assured to them upon the tongue of their prophet, then they would almost rely solely upon that deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their (the Khawārij) distinctive mark is that there will be among them a man with one upper-arm having no forearm. Its end will resemble a breast (of a woman) and there will be white hair upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will march towards Muā’wiyah and the people of al-Shām, leaving them (the Khawārij) behind with your children and wealth! By Allah, I hope that these are those people (that the prophet informed of), for they have shed blood that was to be held sacred and have raided and attacked people. So go in the name of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salamah Ibn Kuhīl said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayd Ibn Wahb was with me at every point until we came to the bridge. That day, ‘Abdullah Ibn Wahb al-Rāsibī was at the head of the Khawārij. He (‘Abdullah) said to his army, “Throw your spears and draw your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they will confront you in the way they did on the Day of Ḥarūrā.” So they went back, let loose their spears and drew their swords. The people fought against them with spears, stabbing them and killing them one after another. And no one was killed that day (from ‘Alī’s army) except two men. ‘Alī ( (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Search among them (the casualties) for the deformed one.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people searched but did not find him. ‘Alī then stood and began searching himself until he came to a group of people who had been killed. He said: “Search everyone of these to the last (of them).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they found him at the bottom, on the ground. ‘Alī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allah is the greatest! Allah told the truth and His messenger conveyed it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abīdah al-Salmānī stood before him and asked, “Oh Chief of the Believers, by Allah other than whom there is no god, did you in fact here this Ḥadīth from Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم )?” He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Yes, by Allah other than whom there is no god.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (‘Abīdah) asked him (‘Alī) to swear three times and he did swear. 22 al-Nawawī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“‘Abīdah al-Salmānī, may Allah have mercy on him, asked ‘Alī to swear three times. He only asked him to swear for the others present to hear and so that it would be emphasized and that it be made known the miracle that Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) informed about. And he wanted to make it wellknown to the people that ‘Alī and his companions were the closer of the two parties to the truth and that he was correct in fighting them.” [23]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">They Consider Their Rebellion to be a Form of Migration for the Sake of Allah</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aḥmad recrded a narration as did Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim recorded in “Kitāb al-Sunnah” – and the<br />
wording is his – that Abī Ḥafṣ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I heard from ‘Abdullah Ibn Abī Awfá when they were fighting the Khawārij. He used to have a young man (that served him, helped him, etc.) but he joined the Khawārij. So we called to him (the young man), ‘Oh Fayrūz! Fayrūz, this is ‘Abdullah Ibn Abī Awfá.’ He replied, ‘A great man if he only made Hijrah (migration)!’ ‘Abdullah asked, ‘What is Allah’s enemy saying?’ He was told what he said. So he (‘Abdullah) said, ‘A Hijrah after the Hijrah I made with the messenger of Allah ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم )? I surely heard Allah’s messenger ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">طُوْبَى لِمَنْ قَتَلَهُمْ وَقَتَلُوْهُ<br />
Tūbá (a tree in Paradise, success) is for he who kills them or they kill him. [24]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Alī’s Attempt to Return Them to the Truth Before Fighting Them</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarīr recorded in his “al-Tārīkh” that Ismā`īl Ibn Samī’ al-Ḥanafī narrated that Abū Zarīr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the issue of al-Taḥkīm (before ‘Alī’s battle with the Khawārij) took place, ‘Alī returned from Ṣiffīn and those who split from him (the Khawārij) also returned. When they reached the river, they established themselves there. ‘Alī entered Kufa (in Iraq) along with the people and they (the Khawārij) were at Ḥarūrā. ‘Alī then sent ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abbās to them but he returned without accomplishing much. So, ‘Alī went out to them and spoke to them until he and they were pleased and mutually content. They all then entered Kufa and a man came to him (‘Alī) and said, “The people are saying that you returned back from your disbelief because of them.” So, he addressed the people after the noon prayer and mentioned the affair. They began criticizing him and gathered near the mosque, saying, “There is no rule except the rule of Allah!” Then a man faced him (‘Alī) and recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ <br />
 وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate (anything) with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers. [al-Zumar, 39:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī replied, reciting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلا يَسْتَخِفَّنَّكَ الَّذِينَ لا يُوقِنُونَ </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is true. And do not let those who have no certain faith worry you. [al-Rūm, 30:60] [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim and al-Nasā`ī recorded a narration in “Khaṣā`iṣ ‘Alī رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ” in which ‘Ubayd Allah Ibn Abī Rāfi’ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the Ḥarūriyyah, before they rebelled, they were with ‘Alī ( .(رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ Then they began saying, “There is no rule except the rule of Allah!” ‘Alī said: “A word of truth, but intended therewith falsehood. Indeed, Allah’s messenger صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ) described a people and I certainly recognize their description within these people. They speak the truth with their tongues, but it does not reach beyond here (and he pointed to his throat) from them. They are form the most hated to Allah of His creation. Among them will be a black man with one arm that will resemble a sheep’s teat or a breast.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, after ‘Alī Ibn Abī Ṭālib ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) killed them, he said, “Search (for the deformed man).” They searched but found nothing. He then said, “Return (and search again) for by Allah, I did not lie nor was I lied to.” He repeated this two or three times. They then found him among the ruined remains and brought him in front of ‘Alī.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ubayd Allah (the narrator) then said, “I was present at that time among them and heard ‘Alī’s statements about them.” [26]</p>

<li>Introduction</li>
<li>The Biography of the Imam Wahab ibn Munabih</li>
<li>Advice to the Khawarij</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah, may the peace and prayers of Allaah be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Khawarij are an evil people, inviters to <em>Fitnah</em> and a flag of separation. The affairs of the Muslims have never been in order and together except that the task of the Khawarij has been to tear this order apart and corrupt what has been rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The presence of the Khawarij has been continuous since they first appeared. There has never been a period of time that has seen their absence until such time as the <strong>last of the Khawarij will rebel along with the <em>Dajjal</em></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many recurring <em>ahadeeth</em> from the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> warning against them and clarifying their characteristics and Allaah’s ruling <em>regarding</em> them. This is why the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> fought against them, as did the rulers who came after them, throughout all periods of Islamic history.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em> ‘Uthmaan bin Affan was not saved from their attacks and evil plots, neither was <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em> ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib nor was <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em> Muawiyyah bin Abee Sufyaan <em>– RadhiAllaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>. The <em>Khalifah</em> Umar bin Abdul Azeez <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was not saved from them, they rebelled against him…… so in reality they are the enemies of the people of Islaam and they are not pleased with any one of the Muslims ruling, no matter how good he is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>was not saved from their attacks, to the extent that their leader <strong>Dhul-Khawaysira</strong> said to him: ‘Be just O Muhammad’ whereby he attacked the character of Allaah’s Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawarij in every time and place have a similarity in resemblance, so their hearts, their tongues and their actions are similar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This booklet, which I have extracted from the biography of the <strong>Imaam Wahab ibn Munabih</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah</em>, clearly explains their description as, in that time, the Khawarij exhibited the issues for which they have become well-known:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Their view of the impermissibility of <strong>paying </strong><em><strong>Zakat</strong> </em>to the rulers of the Muslims; this was due to their declaration of <em>Takfeer</em> on the Muslim ruler and their claim that the Muslim rulers did not spend the <em>Zakat </em>in its proper place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) Their not seeking forgiveness for the one who does not hold their views because they <strong>hold such a person to be a disbeliever</strong> in Allaah The Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those affected by these false claims were those who had little knowledge such that they were deceived by the <em>Zuhud</em> (abstention from loving worldly things), worship and severity in <em>Deen</em> of the Khawarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst those affected by the Khawarij was an elderly and wealthy man from the people of Yemen, but when Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> intended good for him, He led him to the Imaam Wahab ibn Munabih <em>–Rahimullaah</em>. Imaam Wahab informed this man of their condition and warned him about their corrupt ideas and their danger to a man’s religious and worldly affairs. He did all this in a clear way, supported by evidences, which are easily understood by those of sound comprehension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you reflect upon what the Khawarij used to propagate during that period and also at this time, the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> springs to mind:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا الآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Their hearts are alike; We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah:118]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Biography of the Imam Wahab ibn Munabih</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is: Wahab ibn Munabih bin Kaamil bin Seej bin Dhi Kibaar Abu Abdullaah al-Yamaani as-Sanaani. His father came to Yemen from Khurasaan from Haraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahab was born in the year 34 A.H. during the Khilafah of ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan <em>&#8211; radiAllaahu anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahab narrated on the authority of a group of the Companions, including Anas bin Maalik, Jaabir bin Abdullaah, Abdullaah bin ‘Abbas, Abdullaah ibn Umar, Abu Huraira and Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also narrated on the authority of: Tawoos bin Kaysaan, ‘Amroo bin Dinaar, ‘Amroo bin Shuaib, his own brother Hamaam bin Munabih and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad said: ‘He was from the children of Persia.’ Then he said: ‘Everyone from the people of Yemen who had the word ‘Dhi’ in his name was from the Shareef (from Bani Hashim), it is said: so-and-so has ‘Dhi’, and so and so has no ‘Dhi’.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ijaali said: He was a Tabi’ee (a successor of the Companions), trustworthy and he used to be a judge in Sana’.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zurah, an-Nisaee and others regarded him as trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a judge for Umar bin AbdulAzeez <em>–Rahimullaah-</em>in Sana’[4] and his hadeeth are to be found in Bukhari and Muslim. He had much knowledge of the People of the Book and he is counted as being from amongst the <em>Zuhaad</em> (those who abstain from loving worldly things) and the people of piety who would worship plentifully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 110 A.H. in Sana’ at the beginning of the <em>Khilafah</em> of Hisham bin Abdul Malik. It has been said that he died in the year 114 A.H. and Yaqoot deems this to be the stronger opinion in ‘<em>Mu’ajam al-Udaba’</em>.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Abdus Salaam bin Burjis Aal ‘AbdulKareem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6/6/1418 A.H.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Advice to the Khawarij</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee bin al-Madinee said: Hisham bin Yusuf as-Sanaani Abu AbdurRahmaan the Qaadi of Sana’ narrated to us, that he said I was told by Daawood bin Qays that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had a friend from the house of Kholaan from the city of Hadoor, who was called Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I left Sana’ heading towards his village, as I came closer to his village I found a book which had stamped on its back: To Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I reached him, I found him disturbed and saddened, so I asked him why, he said: A messenger came from Sana’ and mentioned that some friends of mine wrote a book and sent it to me and the messenger lost it. So I sent one of my slaves with him to search for it between my village and Sana’ and they did not find it, so I was concerned about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: Here is the book, I have just found it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Praise be to Allaah who has made you find it.’ He opened it and began to read.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: Read it to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Indeed I am younger than you in age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: What is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: It is about striking necks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: Perhaps those who wrote it are the <strong>people of al-Haroora</strong> who wrote regarding the <em>Zakat </em>(obligatory charity) of the ruler?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: From where do you know them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: I and my friends sit with Wahab bin Munabih and he tells us: ‘Keep away from these gullible youth, these people of al-Haroora. You should take the opinion that opposes them, because they are the shameful ones of this <em>Ummah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He pushed the book towards me, so I read and found it said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Bismillah ar-Rahmanir – Raheem</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we praise Allaah before you. There is no God except Him and we advise you with <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah Alone, Who has no partner. Indeed the <em>Deen </em>of Allaah is guidance and the correct path in this world and it is salvation and success in the Hereafter. Indeed the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah is obedience to Allaah and it is opposition of that which goes against His <em>Sharia’ </em>and the Sunnah of His Prophet. So if this book of ours reaches you – if Allaah wills – then see to it that you give Allaah His right in what He has obligated upon you (<em>Zakat</em>). Give it to those who deserve the rule of Allaah and the rule of His <em>‘Aawliyaa</em> (His close friends).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And peace be upon you and the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said to him: Indeed, I warn you against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: How can I follow what you say and leave the saying of the one who is older than you are?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: Would you like me to take you to Wahaab bin Munabih, so that you can listen to what he has to say and he will tell you about them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I went to Sana’ and he came with me, then we proceeded until I took him to see Wahab bin Munabih. Masood bin ‘Auf was the ruler over Yemen appointed by Urwa bin Muhammad. ‘Alee bin al-Madini said: he is Urwa bin Muhammad bin ‘Ateeyah as-Saadi and he was preceded by Saad bin Bakr bin Hoowazin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We found a group of people who usually attended his gatherings, sitting with Wahab and some of them said to me: ‘Who is this Shaykh?’ I said: this is Abu Shaamir Dhu-Kholaan from the people of Hadoor and he has need of Abu Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: why don’t you mention it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: Indeed, he wants to consult him regarding a private matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahab said: ‘What is your need O Dhu-Kholaan?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhu-Kholaan began to speak but he mixed up his words and became scared to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahaab said to me: ‘Speak on behalf of your Shaykh.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said: Yes O Abu Abdullaah, verily Dhu-Kholaan is from the people of the Qur’aan and the people of righteousness, from what we know and Allaah is more knowledgeable about his personal affairs. He has informed me, that he came across a group of people from Sana’ who are from the people of Haroora and that they said to him: The <em>Zakat</em> that you give to the rulers is not compensated by Allaah as reward for you because the rulers do not spend it in its rightful place. So, you should give it to us, verily we will spend it in its rightful place – we will divide it amongst the poor Muslims and we will implement the Islamic punishments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I thought that your speech O Abu Abdullaah would be more satisfactory to him than mine. He has mentioned to me that he gives them the harvests of one hundred <em>Firqan</em> (a quantity) on his riding animals and he sends it with his slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Wahab said to him: O Dhu-Kholaan do you wish to become a <em>Harooreey</em> now you have become old and ascribe misguidance to one who is better than you? What will you say to Allaah tomorrow when you stand in front of Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one you testify against, Allaah testifies that he has <em>Emaan</em> while you testify that he has committed <em>kufr</em>. Allaah testifies that he is guided while you testify that he is misguided? So where will you be if your opinion is opposed by the command of Allaah and your testification is opposed by the testification of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tell me O Dhu-Kholaan what do they say to you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Dhu-Kholaan then spoke and he said to Wahab: They order me not to give <em>Sadaqa</em> (charity) except to those who hold their opinion and not to seek forgiveness except for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahab said: you have spoken the truth, this is their false love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their statement about charity then indeed it has reached me that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>mentioned a woman from the people of Yemen who entered the Fire due to her keeping a cat tied up, she neither fed it nor set it free to eat from the insects of the land.[6] So, is a person who worships Allaah, says that Allaah is Alone and does not associate anything with Him, more beloved to Allaah and worthier of being fed due to hunger or a cat?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ مِسْكِيناً وَيَتِيماً وَأَسِيراً إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَاء وَلَا شُكُوراً إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْماً عَبُوساً قَمْطَرِيراً</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to <em>Miskin</em> (poor), the orphan, and the captive, (Saying): ‘We feed you seeking Allaah’s Face only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you. Verily, we fear from our Lord a Day, hard and distressful, that will make the faces look horrible (from extreme aversion to it).’</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Insaan: 8-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also mentions a difficult and angry day for the sinners due to Allaah’s wrath upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُوراً وَجَزَاهُم بِمَا صَبَرُوا جَنَّةً وَحَرِيراًمُتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ لَا يَرَوْنَ فِيهَا شَمْساً وَلَا زَمْهَرِيراً وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَالُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً وَيُطَافُ عَلَيْهِم بِآنِيَةٍ مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَأَكْوَابٍ كَانَتْ قَوَارِيرَا قَوَارِيرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ قَدَّرُوهَا تَقْدِيراً وَيُسْقَوْنَ فِيهَا كَأْساً كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا زَنجَبِيلاً عَيْناً فِيهَا تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلاً وَيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَانٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ إِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ حَسِبْتَهُمْ لُؤْلُؤاً مَّنثُوراً وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ثَمَّ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيماً وَمُلْكاً كَبِيراً عَالِيَهُمْ ثِيَابُ سُندُسٍ خُضْرٌ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٌ وَحُلُّوا أَسَاوِرَ مِن فِضَّةٍ وَسَقَاهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَاباً طَهُوراً إِنَّ هَذَا كَانَ لَكُمْ جَزَاء وَكَانَ سَعْيُكُم مَّشْكُوراً</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">So Allaah saved them from the evil of that Day and gave them <em>Nadratan</em> (a light of beauty) and joy. And their recompense shall be Paradise and silken garments, because they were patient. Reclining therein on raised thrones, they will see there neither the excessive heat of the sun, nor the excessive bitter cold, (as in Paradise there is no sun and no moon). And the shade thereof is close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach. And amongst them will be passed around vessels of silver and cups of crystal, Crystal-clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure thereof according to their wishes. And they will be given to drink there a cup (of wine) mixed with <em>Zanjabîl</em> (ginger, etc.). A spring there, called <em>Salsabîl</em>. And round about them will (serve) boys of everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls. And when you look there (in Paradise), you will see a delight (that cannot be imagined) and a great dominion. Their garments will be of fine green silk and gold embroidery. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their Lord will give them a pure drink. (And it will be said to them): ‘Verily, this is a reward for you and your endeavour has been accepted.’</span>&gt;&gt; [al-Insaan: 11-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Wahab said: Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta’ala </em>continuously describes what He has prepared for them of the blessings of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: As for their saying: ‘Forgiveness is not to be sought except for the one who holds their opinion.’ Are they better than the Angels?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says in the Soorah of &lt;&lt;Ha-Mim, Ayeen, Seen, Qaaf&gt;&gt;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The angels glorify the praises of their Lord and ask for forgiveness for those on the earth</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Shuraa’: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I swear by Allaah that the Angels could not do this by themselves nor could they do this unless they were ordered because Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَا يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُم بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>They speak not until He has spoken and they act on His Command</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Anbiyya: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has affirmed this Ayaat in Soorah &lt;&lt; Ha mim…. &gt;&gt;[Shuraa’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and it is explained in the major Soorah &lt;&lt; Ha mim&gt;&gt;[Ghafir] where He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الَّذِينَ يَحْمِلُونَ الْعَرْشَ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see O Dhu-Kholaan that I lived at the beginning times of Islaam and I swear by Allaah that the Khawarij did not have a group except that Allaah divided them because of their evil condition. Not one of the Khawarij came out with this opinion except that Allaah struck his neck and none of the <em>Ummah</em> ever gathered together under one man of the Khawarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If Allaah had given the Khawarij strength in their opinion, the world would have become corrupt and the highways would have been cut off, <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>Haraam</em> would have stopped and the matter of Islaam would have returned to <em>Jahileeyah</em>, so much so that the people would seek help from mountain peaks as they used to in <em>Jahileeyah</em>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there would stand more than ten or twenty men and there would not be a single one from amongst them except that he would call for <em>Khilaafah</em> for himself. With every one of these men there would be more than 10,000 people fighting each other, each group would testify to the disbelief of the other group until a believing man would become fearful for his self, his religion, his blood, his family and his wealth, he would not know which way to go, nor would he know whom he should be with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allaah has decided for this <em>Ummah</em> with His command, knowledge and mercy and He makes the best decision for them. He united them and placed love in their hearts for one man who was not from the Khawarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah protected their blood through him, covered up their and their offspring’s shortcomings and gathered all their different factions together through this one man. He made their highways safe and fought the enemy through this man even if it was only for the sake of the Muslims’ honour. He established the Islaamic punishments by way of him, justly judged the oppressed and strove against the oppressors. This man was a mercy from Allaah and he had mercy upon them due to the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ اللّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَّفَسَدَتِ الأَرْضُ وَلَـكِنَّ اللّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of Bounty to all that exists</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 251]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعاً وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَاناً وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah and be not divided among yourselves. And remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together so that, by His Grace, you became brethren and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire and He saved you from it. Thus Allaah makes His<em>Ayaat</em> clear to you, that you may be guided.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْأَشْهَادُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world’s life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth, (i.e. Day of Resurrection)</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So where do they stand from the point of view of these <em>Ayaat</em>? If they were believers they would have been made victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَالِبُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our slaves, the Messengers, that they verily would be made triumphant and that Our hosts, they verily would be the victors</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [Saffat 171-173]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they were the soldiers of Allaah they would have had victory in Islaam even if it was just once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ رُسُلاً إِلَى قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَاؤُوهُم بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنَ الَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُوا وَكَانَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نَصْرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And indeed We did send Messengers before you to their own people. They came to them with clear proofs, then We took vengeance on those who committed crimes (disbelief, setting partners in worship with Allaah, sins, etc.) and (as for) the believers it was incumbent upon Us to help (them).</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Room :47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they were believers they would have been made victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُم فِي الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِي ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُم مِّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئاً</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds that He will certainly grant them succession in the earth as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after fear, provided they worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Noor: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So where do they stand in this regard? Are any one of them better informed about the Islaam from the days of Umar bin al-Khattab, when they are without a <em>Khalifah</em> or <em>Jamaah</em> and are without insight?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it superior over all religions</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [ Taubah: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that Allaah has fulfilled what He had promised the <em>ahl-us-Sunnah </em>giving them aid, strength and victory over their enemies and those who oppose the opinion of their <em>Jamaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahab said: Has not what sufficed <em>Ahl-ul-Tawheed</em>, <em>Ahl-ul-Qibla</em> and the people who have accepted the rulings of Islaam – the <em>Sunnan</em> practices and obligations of Islaam – sufficed you O Dhu-Kholaan? that which sufficed the Prophet of Allaah Nuh in response to the idol-worshippers and <em>Kuffar</em>, when his people said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَالُوا أَنُؤْمِنُ لَكَ وَاتَّبَعَكَ الْأَرْذَلُونَ قَالَ وَمَا عِلْمِي بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ إِنْ حِسَابُهُمْ إِلَّا عَلَى رَبِّي لَوْ تَشْعُرُون</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They said: “Shall we believe in you, when the meanest (of the people) follow you?” He said: “And what knowledge have I of what they used to do?” Their account is only with my Lord, if you could (but) know.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Shu&#8217;araa 111-113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you not satisfied with what sufficed Allaah’s Prophet and friend Ibraheem in replying to the worshippers of idols, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِناً وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيراً مِّنَ النَّاسِ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when Ibraheem said: “O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me and whoso disobeys me, – still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Ibraheem :35 -36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does not what sufficed Prophet Isa’ with the <em>Kuffar</em>– who took him as a god other than Allaah – suffice you O Dhu-Kholaan? Verily Allaah is pleased, until the Day of Judgement, with the sayings of Nuh, Ibraheem and Isa’ which the believers and those who come after them follow, by which I mean:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily You, only You are</strong> <em>T</em>he All­-Mighty, <em>T</em>he All-­Wise.”</span> &gt;&gt; [Maida: 118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the believers) do not oppose the sayings of the Prophets of Allaah with their opinion, so whom will you follow, if you do not follow the Book of Allaah and the sayings and opinions of His Prophets?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, that your coming to see me is mercy for you if you have heard my speech and have accepted my advice to you. This is evidence against you tomorrow, when you meet Allaah, if you leave the Book of Allaah and return to the opinion of the Huroora.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhu-Kholaan said: So what do you command me to do?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahab said: As for your obligatory <em>Zakat</em>, then give it to the one whom Allaah has placed as a ruler over the affairs of this <em>Ummah</em>, and has gathered the people with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the Dominion, indeed, is from Allaah Alone and it is in His Hand, He gives it to whom He wills and He takes it away from whom He wills. So he to whom Allaah gives rulership, none has the ability to take it away from him. So if you give your obligatory <em>Zakat</em> to the ruler then you have become free of it and if you have any extra then be good and give it to your relatives, those under your authority and your neighbours, from those who are needy, and be hospitable to the one who receives you as a guest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhu-Kholaan stood up and said: I testify that I have relieved myself of the opinion of the Hurooreeyah and have believed in what you said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhu-Kholaan died not very long after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya<br />
Taken from ‘Silsilah as-Saheehah’ (5/12-13), &amp; ‘Moonazaraat ‘aimmat as-Salaf’ p.89-91<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Hurooreeyah rebelled, they isolated themselves in a place. There were 6000 of them and they were united in rebelling against ‘Alee.Continuously people would come to ‘Alee and say: O<em>Ameer ul-Mu’mineen</em>! Verily these people are rebelling against you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Leave them, verily I will not fight them until they fight me and [they will fight me] that’s what they will do.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it came to that day, I came to ‘Alee before the <em>Zuhr</em> prayer and I said to him: ‘O <em>Ameer ul-Mu’mineen</em>! Delay the prayer until it is cooler perhaps I will speak to these people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Verily, I fear for you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Never! I used to be known as a man of good manners, I never harmed anyone.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave me permission to go. So, I put on a very nice garment, the best of what one could get from Yemen and I combed my hair. Then, I visited them at midday whilst they were eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had entered upon a people, the likes of whom I had never seen with regards to their exertion in worship. Their foreheads were wounded due to<em>Sujood</em> (prostration) and their hands had become rough like camels’ feet, wearing recently washed, untidy shirts with very high, raised clothing with tired and worn out faces [due to not caring for themselves].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, I gave salaams to them and they said, ‘Welcome O Son of Abbas! And what is this cloak you are wearing?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, ‘what deficiency do you see from me?Indeed, I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> dressed in the best of what you can find in Yemeni clothing, then I recited this verse</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say, who has forbidden the adornment given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and the good things He has provided&gt;&gt;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said, ‘What has brought you here?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them, ‘I have come to you from amongst the Companions of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and from the son of the uncle of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> (‘Alee), who is his son-in-law – and upon them descended the Qur’aan; and <strong>they are more knowledgeable about it than you and there is not one of them amongst you</strong>. I have come to convey to you what they say, and to convey to them, what you say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group amongst them said, ‘Do not debate with the Quraysh because verily Allaah, <em>Azza wa Jaal</em>, says</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people&gt;&gt;[2],’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a group of them turned towards me and two or three of them said: ‘Verily, we will speak to him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said, ‘come forward, what is the grudge you have against the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah – and the son of his uncle (‘Alee).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said ‘three points’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, ‘And what are they?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Then one of the points is that he (‘Alee) had men judge in a matter of Allaah whilst Allaah said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The judgment is for none but Allaah&gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What have men got to do with the <em>Hukm</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, ‘This is one point.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘As for the second point; then he fought and he did not take captives nor did he take the war booty, if they were <em>Kuffaar</em>, then their captives are permissible for us and if they were believers then their captives are not permissible to take nor was it allowed to fight them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, ‘This is the second point, and what is the third point?’ Or he said something similar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘He should remove the title of <em>Ameer ul-Mu’mineen</em> and if he is not the <em>Ameer ul-Mu’mineen</em>then he is the <em>Ameer ul-Kaafireen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, ‘Do you have any points other than this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘This is sufficient for us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: ‘Do you understand, that if I read to you from the Book of Allaah, <em>Jalla wa thanaa’ahu</em>, and from the Sunnah of His Prophet <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that which refutes what you say; will you return (back)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “As for your statement That ‘Alee had men judge in a matter that was for Allaah; then I will read to you from the Book of Allaah, where Allaah has delegated His <em>Hukm </em>to men regarding the eighth of a quarter of a dirham. Allaah, <em>Tabaraka wa Ta’aala</em>, commanded the people to judge in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not understand the saying of Allaah,<em>Tabaraka wa Ta’aala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe, do not kill the game while you are in a state of ihram, and whosoever of you kills it intentionally, then the penalty is an offering equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you.&gt;&gt;[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the <em>Hukm</em> of Allaah that He delegated men to judge in this matter, if Allaah willed, He could have judged in this matter, but He allowed men to judge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask you, for the sake of Allaah! Are men judging in reconciling in disputes and in preventing bloodshed or judging regarding hunting a rabbit better?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Of course, this is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And regarding a woman and her husband:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; If you fear a breach between the husband and wife, appoint two arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers &gt;&gt;[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is not men judging in reconciling disputes and in the prevention of bloodshed better than men judging regarding the private parts of a woman?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Have we finished with this point?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘As for your statement, He fought but did not take captives and did not take war booty, then would you take your mother, Aa’ishah, as a captive, making her permissible for yourselves for that which you make permissible from other than her whilst she is your mother? If you say: “We make <em>Halaal</em>from her that which we make <em>Halaal</em> from other than her,” then you have made/committed <em>Kufr</em>. And if you say that, “she is not our mother,” then you have also made <em>Kufr</em>: &lt;&lt;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers &gt;&gt;[6] and so you are between the two ill judgments. So, which of them do you want to take?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Have we finished with this point?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for ‘Alee removing the title of <em>Ameer ul-Mu’mineen</em>, then I will give you something that will please you: Verily, the Prophet of Allaah – made an agreement/contract with the <em>Mushrikeen</em> on the Day of Hudaybeeyah, and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to ‘Alee: “Write, O ‘Alee! This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah, <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> agrees with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They, the <em>Mushrikeen</em>, said, “If we knew you to be the Messenger of Allaah, we would not have fought you.” So, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Erase it, O ‘Alee! O Allaah, Indeed You know that I am the Messenger of Allaah, erase it O ‘Alee! And write this, “This is what Muhammad ibn Abdullaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> makes an agreement/contract upon.”’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is better than ‘Alee and even he erased his own name and erasing his name does not erase his Prophet hood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Have we finished with this point?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘2000 of them came back while the rest of them rebelled and fought, based upon their misguidance, and the Muhaajiroon and Ansaar fought them.[7]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the small booklet <b><i>“Al-Masaa’il-ul-Muntaqaat min Sifaat al-Khawaarij-ul-Ghulaat” </i></b><i></i>[Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij] compiled and prepared by a student of knowledge, ‘Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan, and reviewed and examined by Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan and Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author briefly touches upon the definition, history, and characteristics of the Khawaarij, one of the first and most dangerous sects in Islamic history whose effects and ideologies continue to exist up to today and will remain until the Final Hour. The majority of the treatise is dedicated to outlining the major and distinguishing attributes of the Khawaarij, which the author counts at 58.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to study and be aware of these attributes so that one may avoid characterizing himself with them and thus fall into the ranks of the Khawaarij. This is from the perspective of learning evil in order to avoid it. And it is also beneficial since today, the ways and ideologies of the Khawaarij are prevalent, as can be seen in terrorist acts, suicide missions, assassinations and political strife. So by understanding the characteristics of the Khawaarij, the reader will be able to identify the perpetrators of such crimes, acknowledge their remoteness from Islaam and the fact that they are indeed from the extremist Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The word <i>Khawaarij </i>is the plural of <i>Khaarijee</i>, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If someone (1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or (2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or (3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil, then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“‘Alee tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the Battle of the Camel, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>The Fifteenth Characteristic: </b>They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. [<i>As-Sunnah </i>of Ibn Abee ‘Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik] Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.’ [<i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id </i>(6/240)]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the small treatise titled <b><i>“Hiwaar ma’a Jamaa’at at-Takfeer”</i></b> (A Debate with the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer) by Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this e-book was the treatise that is found within Imaam Muqbil’s book Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 168-186) [Dar-ul-Haramain: 1st Edition; 1999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Muqbil refutes the false concepts of the Takfeeri Jamaa’at, a group that was founded in Egypt by a man named Shukree Mustafaa, and which later spread to other Muslim countries. Their beliefs revolve around declaring Muslims to be disbelievers, hence the name Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, declaring the leaders infidels and actively calling the people to revolt against the Muslim governments and anyone that supports them. Even though Mustafaa was executed in 1978, the false concepts of his group have still managed to creep into the hearts of many Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is especially important, since it deals with the beliefs of those who in recent times call to rebellion, revolution, terrorism and those who seek to spread instability in the Muslim lands as well as throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best remedy for them is to seek knowledge. As for one of them remaining ignorant and not knowing anything about the Arabic language, and then he says: ‘We are men and the Companions are (also) men’, then yes, you are men and the Companions, too, are men. However, the difference between you and the Companions is like the difference between the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is it that the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer preys on? They prey on those individuals who have enthusiasm and zeal for their Religion based on ignorance. The founder of the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, which has appeared during these recent times, was Shukree Mustafaa Al-Misree, who used to be part of the Bankrupt Brotherhood (Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen). Then he experienced great trials in prison and was hardened along with a group of individuals. The governments (at that time) strove hard to disunite the Muslims. So this group would call themselves the Jamaa’at-ul-Hijrah (The Party of Withdrawal). This Shukree Mustafaa used to have some knowledge and he would challenge the faculty of the Azhar University to debate with him, but the Azharees would be afraid due to two reasons: <b>First:</b> All that many of them had to offer was a scanty portion of knowledge of Hadeeth and knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. So they were either only strong in their knowledge of Grammar or their knowledge of Fiqh. <b>Second:</b> They feared that if they beat him, he and his group (Jamaa’at) would come to them at night and kill them. As a result of this, the group grew and spread. So it originated in the Jamaal ‘Abdun-Naasir Prison and then spread to Sudan and to the lands of the Sacred Precincts (Makkah and Madeenah), inconspicuously, and to Yemen, openly. Jamaa’at Ansaar-us-Sunnah rose against them in Sudan after we said that there were some individuals from the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer amongst them. So they feared that people would hear this speech and therefore not support them anymore.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the one who these Takfeeris prey on is the individual who has lots of zeal for the Religion based on ignorance. I challenge all of them – the Egyptians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Kuwaitis and Algerians among them to bring forth one scholar from amongst them. And they claim that they strive hard to have a scholar amongst their ranks! We seek refuge in Allaah from any scholar agreeing with your Da’wah, for he would then be one of the dogs of the Hellfire on the Day of Judgement, and he would shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is how Ahlus-Sunnah is, may Allaah preserve them – they are the ones who confront the people of falsehood, such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer. Don’t think that I am condoning the other groups, for I consider them to be the product of ignorance and calamities caused by the enemies of Islaam in order to split up the ranks of the Muslims. So I say to the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer: You must repent to Allaah and ask the people of knowledge (when you are unaware of matters), as Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>‘So ask the People of the Reminder if you don’t know.’</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 43] This is since if you were to ask one of them what’s your proof on raising the hands in prayer, you would find him saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Or if you were to ask him what’s your proof for prostrating on the seven limbs, he would reply: ‘I don’t know.’ But yet after all that, he puts himself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers! So take things easy, you small ignoramus! How can you put yourself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers?? By doing this, you would be assisting the Communists, the Ba’athees, the Naasirees and the governments, rather, the enemies of Islaam, in splitting up the ranks of the Muslims. Then you would just dwindle away (and be forgotten) like Shabeeb, Naafi’ bin al-Araq, ‘Imraan bin Hattaan and other heads of the Khawaarij. So the ignorant ones melt way, but the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger remains and continues.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: Lamha ‘an-il-Firaq-id-Daalah (pg. 31-37) w/ notes by Shabbaab Ar-Raajihee<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawaarij are those who revolted (i.e. made khurooj) against the ruler during the last part of ‘Uthmaan’s Khilaafah. Their revolting resulted in the murder of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then their evil increased during the Khilaafah of ‘Alee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and they rebelled against him, declaring him to be a disbeliever. They also pronounced disbelief on the Companions, because they would not agree with them in their (false) beliefs. So they ruled that all those who opposed them in their views were disbelievers. As a result, they pronounced disbelief on the best amongst creation &#8211; the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). Why was this (?) &#8211; because they did not agree with them on their misguidance and disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Their Beliefs:</b> They do not adhere to the Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah, nor do they obey the leader. Rather, they hold rebelling against him and renouncing allegiance to him to be from the Religion,[1] contrary to the advice of Allaah’s Messenger of giving obedience and contrary to what Allaah has commanded in His saying: <b>&#8220;Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah made obeying the ruler part of the Religion, and the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) made obeying the ruler part of the Religion, as is found in his saying: <b>&#8220;I counsel you to have Taqwaa of Allaah and to hear and obey, even if a slave should take command over you. For indeed, whosoever lives amongst you, will see many differences&#8230;&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>So obeying the Muslim Ruler is part of the Religion (of Islaam).</b> But the Khawarij say: &#8220;No, we are free (from this).&#8221; This is the way of insurrection and rebellion today!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Khawaarij are those who seek to cause division to the main unified body of Muslims and to revolt against the leaders &#8211; and there is disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger in doing this. They also hold that the person who commits a major sin is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So someone that commits a major sin &#8211; a fornicator, a thief, one who drinks alcohol, for example &#8211; are all considered disbelievers by them. On the contrary, Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah hold such a person as a &#8220;Muslim with deficient Eemaan&#8221;[3] and they call him a &#8220;sinner in the Religion.&#8221; So he is a &#8220;believer&#8221; due to his Eemaan, while being a &#8220;sinner&#8221; due to his major sin. This is because nothing expels one out of the fold of Islaam except Shirk and the well-known things that nullify one’s Islaam. As for the sins that are below Shirk, then they do not cause one to be expelled from the fold of Eemaan, even if they are major sins. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Verily Allaah does not forgive that Shirk (association of partners in worship) be committed with Him, but he forgives what is lower than that (of sins) to whom He wills.&#8221;</b> [Surah an-Nisaa: 48, 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Khawaarij say:</b> &#8220;The one who commits a major sin is a disbeliever, he will not be forgiven and he will reside in the Hellfire forever.&#8221; And this is contrary to what is stated in the Qur’aan. The reason for this is because they do not have understanding (of the Religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note that the cause for their falling into these (false beliefs) was their lack of knowledge. This is because they are a people intense in their worship, prayer, fasting and recitation of the Qur’aan. And they have a strong fervor for the Religion, but they do not have knowledge &#8211; and this is the problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So going to great lengths and exerting oneself in piety and worship must be accompanied by knowledge and understanding of the Religion. This is why the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) described them to his Companions in the following manner: That the Companions would look down upon their own prayer as compared to their prayer and on their worship as compared to their worship. Then he said: <b>&#8220;They will shoot out from the Religion just as the arrow shoots out from a hunted game&#8221;</b>[4] &#8211; in spite of their worship and in spite of their righteousness and their praying Tahajjud at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because their exertion was not based upon a correct foundation, nor upon authentic knowledge, it became a misguidance, a plague and evil upon them and upon the ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And furthermore, it is not known from the Khawaarij &#8211; for one day &#8211; that they fought against the disbelievers ever! Instead, they only fight with the Muslims, as the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;And they will kill the People of Islaam, while leaving alone the people of Awthaan (idols).&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we have not come to know in the history of the Khawaarij that one day they fought against the disbelievers and polytheists. Rather, they are always fighting against the Muslims. They killed ‘Uthmaan and they killed ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. They killed Az-Zubayr Ibn-ul-‘Awaam and killed the best of the Companions. And they have not stopped killing Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is all due to their ignorance of the Religion of Allaah. But in spite of this, they had piety and worship, but since these were not founded upon authentic knowledge, it became a disease on them. This is why the great scholar, Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said in his description of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;They have textual evidences, which they fall short of in understanding<br />
So they have been given shortness in knowledge.&#8221;</i> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they use texts as evidences but yet they do not comprehend them. They use as evidence texts from the Qur’aan and the Sunnah concerning the threat for committing sins, but they do not comprehend their meanings. They do not refer them back to the other texts, in which there is found a promise for forgiveness and the acceptance of repentance for those whose sins are less than Shirk. So they accept one part and leave off another part &#8211; all of this due to their ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having an over-protective love for the Religion and enthusiasm are not sufficient. They must be founded upon knowledge and understanding of Allaah’s Religion. This is so that they can be produced from knowledge and so that they can be put in their proper place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So over-protective love for the Religion is good and enthusiasm is good, but they must be guided and directed by the following of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one with more precedence in the Religion nor more sincere to the Muslims than the Sahaabah (the Comapnions), but in spite of that, they fought against the Khawaarij due to their danger and their evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee bin Abee Taalib fought against them such that he slaughtered them with the worst of killings in the incident of Nahrawaan. By doing this, he realized what the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed us of in that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) gave the good tidings to the one who killed them of goodness and Paradise. So ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib, he was the one who killed them &#8211; so he received this good tiding from Allaah’s Messenger.[7] He killed them in order to prevent their evil from befalling the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an obligation on the Muslims in every generation, if they should become aware of the existence of this wicked methodology, that they remedy it by calling to the Way of Allaah first and educating the people about it. But if they do not accept this, then they must fight against them in order to prevent their evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee bin Abee Taalib (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) sent his cousin, ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abbaas &#8211; the Habr (scholar) of the ummah and the Turjumaan (Interpreter) of the Qur’aan &#8211; to them. So he debated with them and six thousand amongst them repented and returned back, but many remained behind and did not repent. So at this point, the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib, along with the Sahaabah, fought against them. This was in order to prevent their evil and harm from befalling the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the sect known as Al-Khawaarij and their beliefs.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] In our time, perhaps the one who believes that we must hear and obey the leaders in matters that are not sinful, are labeled as government agents or kiss-ups or gullible simpletons! So you will see them attacking the leaders and exposing their faults to the public from the mimbars and in their gatherings. And Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever desires to advise the sultaan (authority) about a matter, then he must not expose it in public, but rather he should take him by his hand and go in privacy with him. So if he accepts (the advice) then that is (reward) for him, and if he doesn’t (accept) then he has conveyed what will be held against him.&#8221;</b> Reported by Ahmad (3/404) from the narration of ‘Iyyaad bin Ghanam (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) Ibn Abee ‘Aasim also reported it in his book As-Sunnah (2/522).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when the leader bars one of them from speaking in public gatherings, they rally together and go out in demonstrations, thinking &#8211; out of ignorance on their part &#8211; that barring someone from speaking or putting someone in jail justifies rebellion! Did they not hear the Prophet’s statement found in the narration of ‘Awf bin Maalik Al-Ashja’ee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) in Saheeh Muslim (1855): <b>&#8220;&#8230;No, so long as they establish the prayer.&#8221;</b> And in the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) found in the two Saheeh Collections, the Prophet said: <b>&#8220;&#8230;unless you see clear and open disbelief, by which you will have proof before Allaah in the matter.&#8221;</b> This was his (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) response to the Companions when they questioned him, seeking permission to fight against the oppressive leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they not know how long Imaam Ahmad remained locked up in prison? And where did Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah die?! Wasn’t Imaam Ahmad put in jail for several years and whipped because he would not say that the Qur’aan was created? So why then did he not order the people to revolt against the Khaleefah? Don’t they know that Shaikh-ul-Islaam stayed in prison for more than two years and died while in it? Why did he not command the people to revolt against the leader? And on top of this, these scholars had a high position in terms of virtue and knowledge, so what about those who are less than them??? Indeed these ideologies and actions did not come to us except after the youth began to take their knowledge from such and such modern-day thinker and from such and such literary poet and from such and such Islamic writer, abandoning the scholars and placing their books behind their backs to be forgotten! Wa laa hawla wa laa quwata ilaa billaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad, Ibn Maajah, At-Tirmidhee, Al-Haakim and many others [Abridged by the translator].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Even if they commit a sin thinking it to be trivial (Istikhfaaf), they do not commit disbelief so long as they do not make it lawful (Istihlaal), contrary to what some of them say: That a person who commits a sin thinking it to be trivial, commits disbelief that takes him out from the Religion. This statement is the essence of the beliefs of the Khawaarij as our Shaikh, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdillaah Bin Baaz said when he was asked about it in Taa’if in 1415H.</p>

They will speak with the best speech of the creatures. Their Eemaan will not go past their throats. So wherever you encounter them, kill them, for indeed there will be a reward for the one who kills them on the Day of Judgement.’&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After narrating a hadeeth about the Khawaarij and their signs, Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Twenty or more than twenty of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger narrated to me that ‘Alee was in charge of killing them.&#8221;</b> Reported by Ahmad in his <i>Musnad</i> (3/33) and his son ‘Abdullaah in <i>As-Sunnah</i> (1512).</p>
