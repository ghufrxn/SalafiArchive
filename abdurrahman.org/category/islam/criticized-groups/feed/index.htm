<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#993300;">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</span> )</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you</strong></span>) (15: 99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said: &#8220;Salim said, (This means) death.&#8221;&#8217; This Salim is Salim bin Abdullah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin Abdullah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, &#8220;Death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-Ala&#8217;- one of the women of the Ansar &#8211; that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon Uthman bin Mazun after he had died, Umm Al-Ala&#8217; said, &#8220;<em>May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Saib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How do you know that Allah has honored him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;<em>May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! If not him, then who else</em>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْر»</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(As far as he is concerned, the death has come to him, and I hope for good for him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence that the meaning of this Ayah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you.) is that acts of worship, such as prayer and the like, are obligatory on man so long as his mind is sound, so he should pray according to his best ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;">صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب</span>»</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret <em>Yaqin</em> (the certainty) as <em>Marifah</em> (&#8220;spiritual knowing&#8221;) as some of the <strong>Sufis</strong> do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of <em>Marifah</em>, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets &#8211; peace be upon them &#8211; and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by <em>Yaqin</em> here is death, as we have stated above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Istighaathah </em>is a type of the types of worship, and it is seeking <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Ghauth</em></strong></span> (deliverance or rescue), and it does not occur except at times of adversity or great difficulty, when a person comes to be in a situation of adversity, then he seeks deliverance and rescue from Allaah and he seeks salvation from this adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And <em>al-Istighaathah </em>(seeking rescue and deliverance) is of two types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type is:</strong> <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue) from a created being, with regard to something that no-one is able to do except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and this is <em>shirk</em>. So whoever seeks rescue and deliverance from other than Allaah, whether it be from a <em>jinn</em> or a human or those people who are absent or from the dead, then this is <em>shirk</em> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So seeking rescue and deliverance through the dead and those who are absent from the devils and the <em>jinn</em>, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>shirk</em></strong></span> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is: </strong>seeking aid and rescue from a created being who is present and who is alive with regard to something he is able to do – this is permissible. He the Most High said in the story of Moosaa:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَاسْتَغَاثَهُ الَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى الَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the man who was upon his religion</strong> (i.e. the religion of Moosaa)<strong> he called to him for assistance and rescue against the one who was an enemy </strong></span>[28:15]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 21436</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Praise be to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet. To continue,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; had read the letter received by his Eminence, the Grand Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) from a number of inquirers whose names are registered at the Secretariat General of the Council of Senior Scholars nos.(5411) ,(1026), (1016),(1395), (1650), (1893), (2106) dated 7/11/1420, 7/2/1421, 7/2/1421, 3/8/1421, 17/3/1421, 25/3/1421, 7/4/1421 A.H., successively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The inquirers asked many questions to the following effect: Lately, the idea of <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/"><strong>Irja</strong></a></em>&#8216; (a deviant conviction claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) has dreadfully spread. Many writers have been propagating it, depending on some incomplete quotations from the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s writings, something which leads many people to confusion with respect to the definition of <em>Iman</em> (faith). They try to exclude the element of deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that anyone who abandons all deeds will still be saved (from Hellfire). This definitely facilitates the committing of sins, acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <em>Riddah</em> (apostasy) for people attain <em>Iman</em> in light of this conviction, even if they do not abide by religious obligations, avoid prohibitions, or act in accordance with Shari`ah (Islamic law). There is no doubt that this conviction has a severe effect on Islamic societies, issues of `<em>Aqidah</em> (creed) and worship. Therefore, I hope Your Eminence will reveal the reality of this conviction and its bad effects, and the truth that is based on the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). I hope you will also verify the writings reported from Shaykh-ul-Islam so that all Muslims can be sure about and have knowledge of their religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After the Committee studied the inquiry, it answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mentioned sayings are attributed to <strong><em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em></strong> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) who exclude deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that <em>Iman</em> is achieved by belief with the heart and utterance with the tongue, whereas the deeds, according to their view, are a condition for attaining perfection but are not considered a prerequisite for it. Thus, according to their conviction, anyone who believes with their heart and utters with their tongue will be a perfect <em>Mu&#8217;min</em> (believer), even if they abandon obligations and violate prohibitions, they will also be entitled to enter <em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) without observing any good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This has led to many null ideas, including the restriction of <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief) to denial of faith and <em>Al-Istihlal</em> (deeming what is <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) to be lawful) by heart. In fact, all these sayings are false, deviant and contradict the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah</em> (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream); the predecessors and successors.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>However this opens the door to the people of evil and mischief to deviate away from their religion and be free from Allah&#8217;s (Glorified be He) commands, prohibitions, fear and reverence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This also deactivates the concept of Jihad (struggling in the cause of Allah), enjoining good and forbidding evil.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Furthermore, this also equates between good and bad, obedient and disobedient people, a person who abides by Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah and the <em>Fasiq</em> (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) who abandons His Commands and Prohibitions since deeds do not violate <em>Iman</em> as they claim.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Imams of Islam concentrated on clarifying the falseness of this conviction and replying to its supporters in the past and the present. They also allocated a chapter for this issue in the books of `<em>Aqidah</em> and compiled complete books in this regard, such as the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in <em>Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Among the fundamentals of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah w-Al-Jama`ah</em> is that Din (religion of Islam) and <em>Iman</em> are attained by words and actions and that <em>Iman</em> increases by acts of obedience and decreases by acts of disobedience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also mentioned in his book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;In this chapter, we find several sayings of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and the Senior Scholars of Sunnah in explaining <em>Iman</em>. Sometimes they say: It is utterance and action and some others say: utterance, action and intention. Others say: <em>Iman</em> is utterance with the tongue, belief with the heart, and acts with organs. All these definitions are true.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, he (may Allah be merciful to him) added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Salaf strictly censured <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> for excluding actions from <em>Iman</em>. However, their claim that all people have the same degree of <em>Iman</em> is absolutely fraudulent. Belief, love, fear of Allah, knowledge, etc., of people vary from one person to another.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Regarding this basic origin, <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> deviated from what was clarified in the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, opinions of the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) and the <em>Tabi`un</em> (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), rather they founded their opinion on their own understanding and linguistic interpretation [of texts]; this is certainly the manner of people of <em>Bid`ahs</em> (innovations in religion).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the proofs that indicate that deeds are included in Iman and that they affect it positively or negatively is Allah&#8217;s saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The believers are only those who, when Allâh is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone); Who perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the believers in truth</span>. (Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Anfaal  Verses: 2-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their <em>Salât</em> (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. And those who turn away from <em>Al-Laghw</em> (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). And those who pay the <em>Zakât</em>. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, &#8211; for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors; Those who are faithfully true to their <em>Amanât</em> (all the duties which Allâh has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants; And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) <em>Salawât</em> (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours). </span>(Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Muminoon  Verses: 1-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Messenger (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Iman</em> (Faith) has over seventy branches, the most superior of which is the declaration that there is no deity except Allah, and the lowest of which is the removal of (anything) harmful from the street, and modesty is a branch of Iman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islam (may Allah be merciful to him) also mentioned inhis book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The origin of Iman is in the heart, including utterance and action. It is recognition of belief, love and submissiveness. Whatever rests in the heart should be manifest in action. If a person does not act in accordance to it, this indicates absence or weakness of Iman. This is why the visible deeds are a reflection of the <em>Iman</em> of heart and a confirmation to what exists in it. They constitute evidence of it and they are a branch and part of full <em>Iman</em>.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Thinking of what<em> Al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> say with respect to the meaning of <em>Iman</em> reveals that this includes disobedience of the Messenger. Obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) denotes the perfection of <em>Iman</em>, and that Allah (Exalted be He) would never render a sinner to be a <em>Kafir</em>. <strong>Suppose</strong> that some people went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and told him: &#8216;We believe in what you have brought us by our hearts and bear witness (that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah) with our tongues, but we do not abide by your commands and prohibitions; as we do not offer prayers, fast, perform Hajj or believe what is told to us; we do not return trusts, fulfill our promises, maintain the ties of kinship or observe any good acts which you ordained us; we drink intoxicants and commit incest and adultery; we kill as many people as we can of your Companions and Ummah (nation) and take their money; we may even kill you too and fight with your enemies against you.&#8217; Can any rational person imagine that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would answer them by saying: &#8216;You are the perfect <em>Mu&#8217;minun</em> (believers) and you are the ones entitled to my intercession on the Day of Resurrection, and it is expected that none of you would enter Hellfire?&#8217; On the contrary, every Muslim indisputably knows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have told them: &#8216;You are the most disbelieving people ever to what I came with&#8217; and that he would have executed them if they had not repented.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When the word of <em>Iman</em> is generally mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, it is meant with dutifulness, piety, and religion as previously mentioned, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared that <em>Iman</em> has over than seventy branches, the best of which is to witness that there is no Deity but Allah, and the least is to remove harm from the road. Therefore, whatever pleases Allah falls under the meaning of <em>Iman</em>. All this is also included in the meaning of dutifulness when generally mentioned, and so are the <em>Taqwa</em> (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and the <em>Din</em> (religion of Islam). It was also narrated that when people asked about Iman, Allah revealed the following Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;">It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces</span> .What is meant here is that <em>Iman</em>, which is accompanied by action, is praised, other than that which is devoid of it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said about Iman; anyone who reports other than this on his authority will be inventing lies against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Whereas what was mentioned in the Hadith concerning the entrance of some people into <em>Jannah</em> despite that they had never done any good is not absolute to anyone who abandons deeds while being capable of doing them. Rather it is restricted to those who have excuses for abandoning deeds or for any other reason that is consistent with the objectives of Shari`ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After clarifying this issue, the Permanent Committee warns against arguing over the fundamentals of `<em>Aqidah</em>, because of the serious consequences resulting from this. It recommends resorting to the books of the Righteous Salaf and leading Muslim scholars which are based on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and accounts of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also warns against referring to any books that carry views opposing the original references, or modern books that are issued by authors who have not acquired knowledge through scholars or from original sources. Those people are intruders to this one great fundamental of `<em>Aqidah</em>. They adopt the views of <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> and falsely attribute them to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>, causing confusion to people. They also wrongly ascribe these views to the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and other Imams of the Salaf through incomplete quotations. We advise them to fear Allah and to return to the Right Path, and not break the unity (of Muslims) by promoting this deviant belief. The Committee also warns Muslims against being tempted and falling into the trap of those opposing <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>. May Allah guide everyone to useful knowledge, righteous deeds and good understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Points 138</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do not say anything about any of the Mothers of the Believers [1] (<em>radi Allaahu anhunna</em>) except good</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] This is the term of respect used for all the wives of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). This is how they have been termed in Soorah al-Ahzaab, Aayah number 6.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 33:6)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 132</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Every Knowledge which worshippers claim to be from hidden inner knowledge (<em>‘Ilmul-Baatin</em>) which is not found in the Book and the Sunnah, then it  is innovation and misguidance.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is what the extreme innovators, amongst them the <em>Baatinees</em> and extreme <em>Soofees</em>, call to. They explain things away by claiming that they have an outer aspect and an inner aspect. They twist the Book of Allah and His <em>Sharee’ah</em> to suit their own desires. Their claim of receiving hidden religious knowledge, outside of the Book and the Sunnah, is disbelief.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 74 : Point 124</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The five daily prayers are permissible behind anyone except a <span style="color:#993300;"><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/"><em>Jahmee</em></a></span>, since he is one who totally negates </strong>(all of the attributes of Allah)<strong>. If you have prayed behind him, then repeat your prayer. And if he is your Imam on the day of <em>Jumu’ah</em>, and he is a ruler, then pray behind him, </strong>(but)<strong> repeat your prayer [1]. If your <em>Imaam</em>, whether a ruler or not, is a person of the Sunnah, then pray behind him and do not repeat the prayer.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] This is reported by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad as the saying of his father, Imaam Ahmad, in <em>as-Sunnah</em> (nos.4-5).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 69 : Point 116</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Beware of looking into rhetorical theology (<em>kalaam</em>) and sitting with the people of rhetorical theology (<em>kalaam)</em> </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] It is reported that Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (<em>rahimahullah</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm branches and shoes and led around the markets an it (should) be said: This is the punishment of those who have abandoned the Book and the Sunnah and taken to theological rhetoric.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Baghaawee in<em> Sharh as-Sunnah</em> (1/218).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“A person of theological rhetoric will never succeed. The scholars of theological </strong><strong>rhetoric are wicked heretics.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibn al-Jawzee in <em>Manaaqib Ahmad</em> (p204).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 68 : Point 114</b><br />
<b>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</b></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <i>rahimahullaah</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">When discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>al-fitnah</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">) occurs, then remain within your house </b></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;"> and flee from proximity of discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah)</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">.

So fear and be dutiful to Allah, He Who is Alone, having no partner. And do not go out in it, and do not fight in it, do not fall into it, do not take sides, and do not incline towards one side and do not love anything from their affairs, since it is said, “</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>He who loves the actions of a people, </i></b><span style="color:#993300;"><i><b>whether</b></i></span><i><b style="color:#993300;"> they are good or bad, will be just like the one who did them</b></i><b style="color:#993300;">.” May Allah guide us and you to those things that are pleasing to Him and keep us and you away from the acts of disobedience to Him.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>NOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] Ibn az-Zubayr (<i>radi Allaahu anhu</i>) narrates: My close friend, Abul-Qaasim (<i>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</i>) advised me,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><b>If you reach anything of the tumult (</b><b><i>fitnah</i></b><b>), go to Uhud and blunt your sword upon it, then remain in your house</b></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad (4/226 and 5/69). Its <i>isnaad</i> is <i>hasan</i>, as has been mentioned by Shaikh al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) in as-Saheehah (3/no.1373).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the proper manner of announcing Adhan (call to Prayer)?<br />
What is your opinion concerning the additions people use after the Adhan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The proper manner of announcing the Adhan is the way taught by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his followers. Bilal (رضي الله عنه) used to announce the Adhan in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died. He used to announce the Adhan during the Makkan period and at Al-Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that we announce today which consists of fifteen phrases:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar,<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest.<br />
Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah,<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that there is no god but Allah.<br />
I bear witness that there is no god but Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah,<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.<br />
I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة<br />
Hayy `Ala as-Salah, Hayy `Ala as-Salah</strong><br />
(Come to Prayer. Come to Prayer);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح<br />
Hayy `Ala al-Falah, Hayy `Ala al-Falah</strong><br />
(Come to success. Come to success);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر, ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
La ilaha illa Allah</strong><br />
(There is none worthy of worship but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that Bilal used to announce in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, he added:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ٱلصَّلَوةُ خَيْرٌ مِن النَّوم<br />
<strong>As-Salatu Khayr-un Mina an-Nawm</strong><br />
(Salah is better than sleeping),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">twice after his saying: Hayy `Ala al-Falah (Come to success), and before saying: Allah-u-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some people used to add as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">حَيَّ عَلَى خَيْرٌ الْعَمَل<br />
Hayy `Ala Khayr al-`Amal<br />
(Come to best of deed),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِي ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna `Aly-an Waliy-ul-llah<br />
(I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">is an <span style="color:#ff0000;">evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced by Shi`ah (Shi&#8217;ites)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible, neither, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) audibly directly after the Adhan. This is a Bid`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable for a Muslim, after announcing the Adhan, to ask Allah to bestow peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ، وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ، آتِ مُحَمَّداً الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ، وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَاماً مَحْمُوداً الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised. Surely, You do not renege Your promise.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing so is commendable for every Muslim whether male or female after the Adhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable also for the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer), as any other person, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after announcing Adhan. He should also recite: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff0000;">But he should not say these words in a loud voice like the Adhan</span>. This is because the Adhan ends with saying: La ilaha illa Allah (There is no god but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Mu&#8217;adhin to raise his voice in order to let others to hear and follow him. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhin, repeat what he says, then invoke blessings on me, for everyone who invokes blessings on me will receive them tenfold from Allah; then beg from Allah Al-Wasilah for me, which is a rank in Paradise fitting for only one of Allah&#8217;s servants, and I hope that I will be that one. If anyone who asks that I be given the Al-Wasilah, he will be assured of my intercession.&#8221;<strong>  </strong></span>[#01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is was stated by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (رضي الله عنه)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a Sunnah for both Mu&#8217;adhin and listener, whether male or female, everywhere after announcing the Adhan. All are to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon Muhammad</strong>!&#8221; or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in a tone that differs from the Adhan&#8217;s and in a lower voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should say: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the Prayer which is going to be established, grant Muhammad Al-Wasilah and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place (in Paradise) that You promised.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in Al-Bukhari&#8217;s Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansary that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whoever says upon hearing the Adhan: &#8216;O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and of the established Prayer (Salah), grant Muhammad the Al-Wasilah and superiority, and raise him up to the praiseworthy position which You have promised&#8217;, <strong>it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221;  </span>[#02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the Hadith reported from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Al-Bayhaqy reported this addition:  &#8220;You do not break Your promise.&#8221;  with a Hasan chain of narrators. This is what is legally permitted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">As for increasing the Adhan by saying: &#8220;Come to the best deed&#8221;, &#8220;I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah&#8221; or any other phrases is an evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) that has no basis in Islam as mentioned earlier. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:  &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever performs any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, it is to be rejected</span>.&#8221; [#03] (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported also by Muslim in his Sahih on the authority of Jabir (رضي الله عنه) that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  used to say during the Friday sermon: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">The best speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are their innovations and every innovation is misguidance</span>.&#8221; [#04]  There are many Hadiths in this regard. Allah is the One Who grants success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh AbdulMuhsin bin Hamd al-Abbaad al-Badr</strong> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the Worlds, and the praise, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon His Messenger and upon his Family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In response to the question about the Asha’irah: Are they from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: ‘The Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah are the Noble Companions <i>–</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhum</i>, and those who followed their path, just as the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said in explaining the ‘Firqat an-Najeeyah’ (the Saved Sect): ‘They are those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their belief in the Names of Allaah – the All-Mighty and the Magnificent – and His Characteristics (Sifaat) is that they affirm for Allaah –Azza wa Jal- what is affirmed in the Book and the Sunnah from the Names and Characteristics in the way which they befit Allaah -Subhanahu Ta’ala- without explaining how they are, or resembling them with anything else, or with Tamtheel (to liken Allaah or His Characteristics to that of the creation), or Tahreef (alteration and distortion of wording or meaning), or Ta’weel (metaphorical interpretation) of them or cancelling them.  Just as Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; لَيۡسَ كَمِثۡلِهِۦ شَيۡءٞۖ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلۡبَصِيرُ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">here is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing the All-Seeing</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Shura : 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayaah there is the affirmation that Allaah Ta’ala has the two Sifaat (Characteristics) of Hearing and Seeing, which is in His statement: &lt;&lt; <strong>and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</strong>&gt;&gt;, and not likening Allaah to resembling anyone with Him as is in His statement: &lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Asha’irah are those who ascribe to the Madhab (School of Thought) of Abul-Hasan al-Asha’ari <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> who was born in the year 270 A.H. and died in the year 330 A.H.  That Madhab on which he was before he came back to the Madhab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.  That Madhab which was on <em>Ta’weel</em> (metaphorical interpretation) of most of the <em>Sifaat</em> (Characteristics of Allaah), which is opposite to the Madhab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Asha’irah are from the deviated Islaamic sects, they are deviated from what Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah are upon.  It is not perceivable to the intellect that the truth was hidden from the Companions, and the Successors but then after that the truth had occurred in following a belief which was born after their time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr in his book ‘Fath al-Bari’ (13/407) quoted many statements from the Salaf about the authentic Aqeedah which is established upon the Book and the Sunnah and the understanding of the Salaf of the Ummah, he summed it up by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Many quotes have preceded from the people of the third period of time and they are the Fuqaha (scholars) of the different lands, like Thawri, al-Awzaiee, Malik, al-Layth and those who lived at their time, and likewise those who took from them, from the other Imams. So how can a person not trust what the people of the first three generations agreed upon, and they are the best generations, with the testification of the owner of the Sharia?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr also quotes from al-Hasan al-Basari that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If what al-Ja’ad is saying is true, then the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>would have conveyed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ja’ad is Ibn Dirham the founder of the Madhab al-Jahmeeyah.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will say the like of what al-Hasan al-Basari <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If what the al-Asha’irah and other than them from the philosophers say is true, then the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> would have conveyed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Takeed al-Musalamaat as-Salafeeyah’ p. 5]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad Yahya an-Najmi</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The truth of which there is no contention about, is that the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah are from the groups of the Ahl-ul-Bida’.  It is not allowed for anyone to say that they are from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and whoever claims that these two groups are from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah then he has squeezed himself between a grave and serious mistake, and a humiliating danger, and he will be questioned on the Day of Judgement about his statement before he is freed to go on his path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa in (3/347) after speaking about this issue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘With that it becomes clear that the people with the most right to be the Firqat Najeeyah (the saved sect) are the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth and Sunnah those who do not have someone they biasedly follow except the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and they are the most knowledgeable of the people regarding his statements, his situations, and they are the greatest in distinguishing between the authentic and weak of those statements and situations. Their Imams are scholars regarding those statements and situations and they are the people of knowledge of its meanings, and they follow them, with truth, action, love, with loyalty to the one who is loyal to it and have enmity to the one who has hatred to it. . . . [until he said]… and whatever the people differed over in regards to the issues of Sifaat (Characteristics of Allaah), al-Qadr (pre-destiny), al-Waeed (threat of punishment), Names of Allaah, enjoining the good, forbidding evil and other issues, then here they would return those issues to Allaah and His Messenger. They would refer to the Tafseer (explanation) of those general wordings of which the people of sects and differences differed over and whatever was in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah they would affirm that, and whatever was in opposition to the Book and the Sunnah they would regard that as false. They would not follow speculation or what their souls inclined and desired, because following speculation is ignorance, and following one’s desires without guidance from Allaah is oppression, and together that is evil: ignorance and oppression.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can those who apply the intellect in issues of al-Eemaan, which are well-established in the Book and the Sunnah be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah, when they accept what they want from the Book and the Sunnah and reject what they want?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah only affirm seven Sifaat of Allaah from His Sifaat, and they metaphorically interpret all the other Sifaat of Allaah, which in turn leads to cancelling out the Sifaat of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can that person be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&gt; by saying [Isteewa means] Allaah conquered His Throne, so it is as if this person is saying that someone else had taken Allaah’s Throne and then after that Allaah had to conquer it?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can that person be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the hadeeth that Allaah descends the last third of the night which is established in the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah –Azza wa Jal- descends every night to the heavens of the Dunyaa, at the second half of the night, or at the third of the night and says: who is making Dua’ to Me so that I can respond to him; who is asking of Me so that I can give him it; who is seeking forgiveness from Me so that I can forgive him until Fajr comes in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, and it is originally in Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who metaphorically interprets this, says it means: ‘Allaah’s command descends,’ [and not Allaah Himself] even though Allaah’s –Azza wa Jal- command descends at every time and moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can that person be from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah who metaphorically interprets Allaah’s Two Hands to mean Allaah’s blessings, even though Allaah –Subhana wa Ta’ala- connected/linked/explained that thing which is specific for the hand, which is spending, Allaah –the Most Magnificent- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَقَالَتِ ٱلۡيَهُودُ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ مَغۡلُولَةٌۚ غُلَّتۡ أَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْۘ بَلۡ يَدَاهُ مَبۡسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيۡفَ يَشَآءُۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<b> </b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Jews say: ‘Allaah’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).’ Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills.</strong></span> &gt;&gt;[2]  knowing that the blessings which the Noble (Jaleel) Lord confers upon His worshippers are so many they cannot be enumerated?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Magnificent said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآۗ  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<b> </b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you would count the graces of Allaah, never could you be able to count them.</strong></span> &gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can that person be from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the Hadeeth: ‘Allaah does not look at the one who drags his garment below his ankles out of pride.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim] and other Hadeeth with this meaning; he metaphorically interprets ‘Allaah looking’ in this Hadeeth that the meaning of ‘looking’ is metaphorical for mercy, meaning that Allaah will not have mercy upon them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other deviated metaphorically interpretations, which transfer the texts present from Allaah –Azza wa Jal – in His Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger, which comprise of lofty meanings, which are befitting Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and they metaphorically interpret them with a false interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we think about it, what has obligated them to metaphorically interpret the Sifaat like this, then we find that they claim that the condition and state of the intellect is that this is how Allaah should be characterized with those [distorted] characteristics; because they made and took the foundations of the people of Kalam (rationalistic theology &amp; philosophy) as the foundation, and they used this foundation above that of the texts of the Sharia’, which came in the Book of Allaah, and in the Sunnah of the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which affirm for Allaah –Azza wa Jal- Names and Characteristics which befit His Majesty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah made those foundations rationalistic theology (Kalam), which was taken from the philosophers, and the people of logic (<i>Mantiq</i>) those who were drowned in knowledge of rationalistic theology, and they spent their time in it, and wasted their lives in it, and their end result was confusion.’</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They </strong>(Jahmiyyah)<strong> continued in time and found rulers who were to assist them in this and who subjected those who refused it to the sword or the whip. Knowledge of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> was wiped away and weakened by them so that they became suppressed due to the manifesting of innovation and speech about it and their great number. They established sittings, manifested their opinions, wrote books about them, enticed the people and they sought leadership for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It was a very great trial </strong></span>[2]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. Only those whom Allah protected were saved from it. The slightest that a person would be affected by sitting with them was that he would be caused to doubt about his religion, or to follow them, or to hold their saying to be true,not knowing whether it was the truth of falsehood, so he became one who doubted. So the people were ruined until the time of Ja’far, who was known as al-Mutawakkil </strong></span>[3]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>, through whom Allah extinguished innovation and manifested the truth and the people of the Sunnah. They spoke out, despite their small number and the great number of innovators, right up to this day of ours </strong></span>[4]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for their principles and misguidance, some of them have remained acting upon it and calling to it, with none to prevent them from their sayings and actions!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Proclamation was made that everyone had to adhere to the belief of the Mu’tazilah that the Qur’an was created! The scholars were threatened and ordered to agree to this. Those who refused to assent verbally were imprisoned, threatened with death and tortured. Imam Ahmad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) stood firm, despite months in prison, constantly being brought before those in authority and threatened with death and kept in chains. Eventually, he was lashed severely in public. ‘Alee ibn al-Madeenee said, “<strong>Indeed, Allah aided this religion through Abu Bakr on the Day of Apostasy (<em>riddah</em>) and through Ahmad ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial (<em>mihnah</em>)</strong>.” Reported by adh-Dhahabee in Tadhkiratul-Huffaadh (2/432).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The ‘Abbaasid caliph, al-Mutawakkil ‘alallaah: Abul-Fadl, Ja’far, son of al-Mu’tasim billaah, al-Qurashee. He died in the year 247 after the Hijrah. May the Mercy of Allah be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Refer to the letter of Ahmad ibn Hanbal to al-Mutawakkil, mentioned in <em>as-Sunnah</em> of his son, ‘Abdullah, as point number 84.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some of the scholars, amongst them Ahmad ibn Hanbal, declared the Jahmee to be a disbeliever and not from the people of the Qiblah. His blood is lawful. He does not inherit, neither is inheritance received from him, since he says that <em>there is no Jumu’ah or congregational prayer, no ‘Eid prayer, no charity (Sadaqah)</em> and because they say, “<em>One who does not say the Qur’an is created is a disbeliever</em>.” They allow fighting and killing within the nation of Muhammad (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). They contradict those who preceded them. They put the people to trial regarding something that neither the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) nor any of his Companions spoke about.</strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They desire to empty the Mosques and for the congregations to be neglected. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They weakened Islam, caused Jihaad to be left and busied themselves with sectarianism. They went against the narrations and spoke up with that which had been abrogated </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. They used verses of uncertain meaning as clear proof and so caused the people to have doubts about their religion. They disputed about their Lord and said, “<em>There is no punishment in the grave, nor any Pond (Hawd), nor any Intercession and Paradise and the Fire have not been created</em>.” They rejected much of what the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said. Those who permit the declaration of their being unbelievers declare them to be so and declare the spilling of their blood to be lawful because of these matters, since whoever rejects a verse from the Book of Allah has rejected the whole Book and whoever rejects a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) has rejected all of his sayings and is a disbeliever in Allah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Mu’tazilah and the Raafidah denied abrogation (<em>naskh</em>). Before them, the Jews had denied it.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Transcript of the Audio:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And some of the scholars; amongst them Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal said: ‘The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>, his blood can be lawfully shed, he does not inherit nor is inheritance received from him. Since he says, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer, no congregational prayer, no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no charity.” And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The saying of the scholars: “The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the Qiblah,”</strong> meaning <em>Kaafir</em>; he is a disbeliever on account of his blind sayings because he has negated Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And there is no doubt that this is the worst of disbelief. Their sayings of disbelief lead to <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (total negation), as was said by the Shaykh (the author) and it is denial of the existence of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And Imaam A<u>h</u>mad <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> has refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah,</em> and this is printed and verified &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. And a number of the people have refuted them. Shaykh ul-Islaam refuted them in his huge book <em>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He (the Jahmee), his blood is lawful to be shed, he does not inherit not is inheritance taken from him.”</strong> Because he is a <em>Murtad</em> (apostate), so therefore his blood is lawful to be shed because that which renders a person’s blood secure is Islaam whereas the <em>Kaafir</em>; his blood is lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because he says (the Jahmee; the follower of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan) that, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and there is no <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (congregational) prayer,” </strong>because Al-Jahm denied the <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and he denied the congregational prayer. All that is sufficient in his view is <em>al-ma`rifatu billaah</em> (a person has awareness of Allaah). So <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) with him is just <em>al-ma`rifah</em> (awareness). So if a person is aware of his Lord in his heart then he becomes a believer; <em>mu·min</em> who is perfect in his <em>eemaan</em> even if he doesn’t pray, even if he doesn’t fast, even if he doesn’t do anything from the acts of worship at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he said that, “There are no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no <em><u>S</u>adaqah</em> (charity). </strong>Because he held that deeds are not a part of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) nor its utterance upon the tongue nor is belief either. Rather, <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in his view is near <em>ma`rifah</em> (awareness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.” </strong>The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said, “Whoever doesn’t say that the Qur·aan is created and rather says that the Qur·aan is the speech of Allaah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has caused Allaah to resemble His creation and <em>Tashbeeh</em> (declaring resemblance to the creation) is <em>kuffar</em> (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they permitted use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>! And they contradicted those who came before them, they put the people to trial with something which neither Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor anyone from his companions spoke with. They sought for the emptying and abandonment of the mosques and the congregations. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they held as lawful the use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>!” </strong>They permitted killing the Muslims; those who disagreed with them in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). And therefore when they gained authority in the time of Al-Ma·moon, what did they do to the Muslims? They killed those of the scholars whom they killed and they tortured those who they tortured in order to try and force them to hold the saying that was the position of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they contradicted whoever came before them,”</strong> from the Muslims. So these sayings did not appear except from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“they put the people to trial with something which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not speak with.” </strong>They wanted to force the people to accept their saying as occurred in the time of Al-Ma·moon and those who came after him when they tried to force the people to accept the saying that the Qur·aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they wanted to empty out the mosques and the congregations. </strong>Because their position with regard to <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is that it is merely awareness, even if the person does not do any action, even if he does not speak with his tongue, even if he does not hold belief in his heart. So therefore, there would be no need for the mosques and the congregations because the prayer is not obligatory in their view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they weakened Islaam, caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left and busied themselves with causing separation, they contradicted the narrations and they spoke with that which had been abrogated, they utilised unclear text as proof and they caused the people to have doubts about their religion. And they disputed regarding their Lord and they said: “There is no punishment in the graves nor any great reservoir; <em>al-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> nor any intercession; <em>shafaa`ah;</em> and that Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” And they denied much of that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said. So therefore, those who permitted that they be declared disbelievers declared that their blood may be lawfully shed from this aspect. Since whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book and whoever rejects a single <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations. And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And they caused weakness in Islaam,” </strong>meaning, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> weakened Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left,” </strong>they left off Jihaad in the cause of Allaah because they do not hold that disbelievers are to be declared disbelievers because they have awareness of Allaah. And this means that Fir`awn was a Muslim then because he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the context of what Musa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to Fir`awn when he went to call him to the truth that he said to him: “You indeed know that no-one has sent these signs except the Lord of the heavens and the earth&#8230;” </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. And the people of <em>shirk</em>; the <em>mushrikoon</em> in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; they had awareness of Allaah in their hearts. Indeed they used to worship Him with different types of acts of worship so they believed that Allaah &#8211; the Perfect &#8211; is the Lord and that He deserves worship. However, they associated others in worship along with Him claiming that those others besides Him will draw them closer to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they contradicted the narrations,” </strong>meaning they contradicted the evidences and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they spoke with the abrogated texts,” </strong>they took a hold of evidences that had been abrogated and they do not act upon the text which abrogates in order to misguide just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…So as for those in whose hearts there is deviation then they follow that which is unclear from it… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the <em>Mutashaabih</em>, from that which is unclear on its own is the <em>Mansookh</em>, those texts that have been abrogated because it is necessary for the person to have awareness of the <em>Naasikh</em> and the <em>Mansookh</em> (the text which abrogates and the earlier text which was abrogated). And also <em>al-mu<u>t</u>laq w`al muqayyad</em> (to have awareness of the unrestricted text and the restricted texts) and the <em>khaa<u>s</u></em> and the `<em>aam</em> (the text which has been specified and the general text). He must have awareness of the branches of knowledge for the derivation of evidences. So, he does not use as evidence just any text, which he finds without seeing whether it is something abrogated or whether it is something which has been made specific by something or whether it is something which has been restricted by something; not examining this on account of deviation and in order to misguide the people. And they say that: “We use the Qur·aan as proof.” But they are not actually using the Qur·aan as proof. The Qur·aan is used as proof by those who accept all of it. But as for one who takes just a part of it and leaves the other parts then he is a disbeliever in it. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Do you believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in other parts?&#8230; </strong>(Sooratul Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who does not gather between the <em>Muhkam</em> and <em>Mutashaabih</em> (clear and clarifying texts along with the texts, which are unclear) combine the two then this one is taking a part of the Book and leaving a part. And therefore, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Whereas those firmly grounded in knowledge they say: “We believe in it, all of it.” … </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: “<em>Kullun</em>” (All of it); meaning the <em>Muhkam</em> (those texts which are clear and clarified) and the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which is not immediately clear with regard to its meaning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…They say: “All of it is from our Lord”… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, they refer the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those texts, which are unclear) to the <em>Muhkam</em> (to that text, which is clear and clarifies it) so therefore, it explains it and clarifies it. However, this requires a scholar; `<em>aalim</em>. It is not permissible for a pretender to knowledge to enter into it or a person who is a deviant intending to misguide. So, the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (the text, which is unclear) will not be taken hold of except by 1 of 2 kinds of men; either one who is <em>zaa·igh</em> (deviant) and intends to misguide like the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. And therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad said about them: “They use as evidence that which is unclear from the Qur·aan.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second type of person who uses the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those aayahs, which are not on their own clear with regard to their meaning) or otherwise a <em>Muta`aalim</em> (a false pretender to knowledge who doesn’t realise and speaks about Allaah without knowledge.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they used unclear texts as proof,” </strong>and therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em>. He brought the texts which they use as evidence, and he refuted their opinion about them, and he made clear the correct understanding of those texts and he harmonised between the <em>aayahs</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“so they caused the people to have doubts about their religion.”</strong> So there is no doubt that this is confusion in thoughts and ideas. So, it is not permissible to speak about matters of knowledge and especially matters of <em>`aqaa·id</em> (creed and beliefs) except one who firmly grounded in knowledge. It’s not permissible for them to be spoken about by half students or by false claimants to knowledge not to mention by people of deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they disputed concerning their Lord,” </strong>they innovated <em>al-jadal</em> (newly brought about argumentation, religious debating). He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No-one disputes about the signs (<em>aayaat</em>) of Allaah except for those who disbelieve. So do not let their travelling about upon the land deceive you. </strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer does not dispute about the <em>aayaat</em> of Allaah. Rather, he accepts them and he believes, he holds as his belief that they are the speech of Allaah and that they are good and guidance. But as for the person who just withholds about them and raises doubts then this is one who disputes about the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no punishment of the grave,” </strong>This fully confirms with their <em>madhhab</em> because in their view whoever has awareness of Allaah then he is a believer of it and it is not necessary that he has to pray and fast and perform <em>Hajj</em> and perform `<em>Umrah</em> nor carry out the deeds. And based upon this there will be no punishment in the grave because all of mankind have awareness of Allaah and therefore, there is no sin and obedience so those who are in the graves all have awareness of Allaah. So therefore, they will not be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Great Reservoir) nor any <em>shafaa`ah</em> (intercession),” </strong>All of the affairs of the hidden and the unseen; <em>ghaib</em>, they denied them because they place reliance upon their intellects alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” </strong>Meaning the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created despite the fact that Allaah has informed that they are already created. He, the Most High said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paradise has already been prepared for the <em>Muttaqeen</em> (People of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to Allaah). </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aw-Iddat</em> (already prepared); it shows that it’s already been prepared and is present and He said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It has already been prepared for the disbelievers. </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that the severe heat in the summer is from the breathing out of the Hellfire and this indicates that it is present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the fire has 2 breaths; a breathing in, in the winter and that is the severest cold that you find and it has a breath (breathing out) in the summer time and that is the severest heat that you find. The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The severest summer heat is from the breathing out of the Hellfire.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they denied much of that which was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong>They denied much of that which occurs in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> because it contradicts their opinion and what they believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So those who held it lawful to declare them as disbelievers declared their blood lawful to shed from this aspect.” </strong>Those of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> who declared them to be disbelievers; that he declared them to be disbelievers on account of all of these filthy sayings gathered because they result in there not being any religion left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book,” </strong>As has preceded that whoever takes as proof part of the Qur·aan; believes in other parts so regarding some he tends to cling onto it then he has believed only in a part of the Book and he has left the other part. So a person who uses as proof that which is unclear (the <em>Mutashaabih</em>) and leaves aside the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he is from those who believe in a part of the Book and reject other parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever rejects a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations.” </strong>Likewise, the <em>Sunnah</em> contains that which is <em>Muhkam</em> (clear and clarified) and it contains that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which on its own is unclear). So whoever takes that which is unclear from the <em>Sunnah</em> and leaves off the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he has rejected all of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.” </strong>This is the result and Allaah’s refuge is sought because the one who truly believes in Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The true believer says, “We have <em>eemaan</em> in all of it, we believe in it. All of it is from our Lord.” </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of deviation then he takes that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (unclear) because it is more fitting for his purpose. And as for the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear, clarifies) then it does not suit his purpose so he leaves it. This is the way of people of the desires, the way of the deviated sects always and it is not specific to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, its origin was from the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, the people of the deviated sects, all of them in every time, this is their way. They take hold of those proofs, only the ones that will conform to their desires and they leave whatever conflicts with their desires. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee<em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, `His saying, <strong>“they spoke with that which has been abrogated,”</strong> what he intended was that they deny abrogation; the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> deny <em>naskh</em> (deny that there is abrogation). So, the <em>Jahmiyyah </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em>Raafidah</em> and before them the Jews denied there being any abrogation and they said; “Abrogation does not occur, neither in the Qur·aan nor in the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Salaf</em> have refuted them.`</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (reference should be <u>h</u>adeeth no. 533/534) from Aboo Hurayrah and Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> and also reported by Muslim (615) from Aboo Hurayrah and likewise by Muslim (2209) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> A point that’s brought by some of the explainers, they mention Ibn al-Qayyim with regard to the declaration of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; the disbelievers, Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said in his famous poem; An-Nooniyyah that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> were declared to be disbelievers by 500 scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong><em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said on this point with regard to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is a disbeliever; “this saying where the author mentioned at great length then in summary it is that he passed the judgement that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> are disbelievers and there is no doubt of the disbelief of the first <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who founded it, the initial <em>Jahmiyyah</em> but as for the second (later <em>Jahmiyyah</em>) who had developed into the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> then those people no-one from the <em>Salaf</em> declared them to be disbelievers. So the speech of the author is not to be taken unrestrictedly. And then he intended here that the affair itself is disbelief. So as for one who is upon it; a particular individual then he is to be examined. Have the conditions meaning declaring him to be <em>kaafir</em> been fulfilled and have any preventing factors been removed or not? So if the conditions for him to be declared a disbeliever are present and any preventing factor is absent then the judgement will be passed upon anyone who denies anything that the author has already mentioned here or who rejects anything from the texts, he will be judged to be a disbeliever if the proof is established upon him; conditions for declaring him so are present and preventing factors are absent.” And then he mentioned the issue with regard to the individual as well-that detail is necessary, Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 57: Point 100</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> was that they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. They introduced &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217;. They abandoned the narrations. And they applied analogy , they weighed the religion according to their opinion. So they came with disbelief openly .They disbelieved and declared the rest of the people to be disbelievers. And the affair led them necessarily to stating <em>Ta&#8217;teel</em> (outright negation).</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-jahmiyyah-were-ruined-due-to-their-pondering-about-allah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> came about because they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>the reason which caused the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> to become misguided to this great extent of misguidance is that they entered into the affair of the Lord, they began searching into it. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to search into the matter of the Lord. Rather, what is upon him is to have eemaan in Him and His Names and in His Attributes and not to enter into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one knows about His Self and about how His Names and Attributes are except for Him, He, the Perfect. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah knows whatever is before them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with Knowledge.</span> </strong>(Soorah-<u>T</u>aa Haa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one can encompass Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; He is the one who knows best about Himself and about other than Himself. So, therefore, we do not speak about the affair of Allaah except for that about which there is a proof from the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the Sunnah. And we withhold from whatever does not occur; whatever is not reported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> denied the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and they entered with their intellects into the affair of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High to the extent that they said that: ‘<em>He is not within the Universe nor is He outside the Universe, He is not above nor is He beneath, He is not to the right nor is He to the left.</em>’ Therefore, He would not exist then &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above what they say. They said: ‘<em>He does not have hearing, He doesn’t hear and He doesn’t see and He doesn’t have knowledge and He doesn’t have will</em>.’ Therefore, He would be inanimate; non-living thing because an inanimate object is that which is described with these characteristics. So He would in that case be like the idols &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“They imagined and made analogies with regard to the religion based upon their own opinion,” </strong>They followed false analogy, they drew analogy between Allaah and His creation and therefore they denied His Names and His Attributes because in their view they necessitated resemblance. And they did not know that the Names of Allaah and His Attributes are particular to Him, He the Perfect and that the names of the created being and the attributes of the created being are specific to them and there is no resemblance between this and that. So, just as Allaah has a self, which does not resemble the selves of creation then likewise He has Names and Attributes, which do not resemble the names and attributes with the created being. Whoever takes hold of this will be at ease and proceed upon the correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they came with disbelief openly, it was not hidden.” </strong>They disbelieved in Allaah on account of these ugly sayings concerning Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they disbelieved and they declared the rest of the creation to be disbelievers.” </strong>They declared as disbelievers those people who describe Allaah with His Names and His Attributes because they say they are <em>mushabbihah</em> (they are ones who claim that Allaah resembles His creation) and <em>tashbeeh</em> (declaring the creator resembles the creation) is disbelief; <em>kufr</em>. So we say no, this is not <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance). Allaah the Majestic and Most High, He, the Perfect has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Allaah and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.</span> </strong>(Sooratus-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negated from Himself <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) and yet He affirmed for Himself Hearing and Seeing even though hearing and seeing are present amongst the created beings. So this shows that this does not resemble that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>&#8220;And the affair unnecessarily led them to stating total negation.” </strong><em>At-Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> is to deny the Creator, the Perfect and Most High. Because this leads to negation because one who does not hear and he does not see and he does not speak and has no will and has no wish and also is not inside the Universe nor is he outside the Universe and is not above and is not below. Therefore, there was no God who is worshipped in existence at all. So the affair ended up for them with apostasy and total negation.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side-point</strong>: If you read the story of Jahm ibn Safwaan exactly what happened to him. They say he debated with some people who doubted his Lord and he ended up doubting that they had a Lord so he even abandoned the prayer for a period of 40 days or something. They confused him so much with regard to his Creator, who are you going to pray to then? So the Shaykh said they refer the affair of Jahm and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, that’s what it lead to, it leads to this; <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation of the Creator) altogether; denial of the Creator.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-saysmy-recital-of-the-quran-is-created-then-he-is-a-jahmi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah affirmed speech; <em>al-Kalaam</em> for Himself in many <em>aayahs</em>, from them is the saying; He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If the water of the ocean were ink to write down the words of My Lord then the ocean would be exhausted before the words of My Lord were finished&#8230;”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah</em> 109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the words of Allaah with which He commands and forbids and manages the creation with. Who can then enumerate the words of Allaah, He, the Perfect and Most High? They could not be written down by the oceans nor by all of the pens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the speech of Allaah, the <em>Kalaam</em> is as said by the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to its type; eternal, with respect to its individual instances, it newly comes about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Qadeemun-Nau`</em> means that Allaah, the Most High has always had the attribute of speech. However, with regard to individual instances, for example, Allaah, the Most High speaking to Aadam or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Moosaa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or speaking to Jibreel with the <em>Qur·aan</em> then these individual instances of the speech of Allaah; they newly occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is from the newly occurring instances of the speech of Allaah and some individual instances of the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of Allaah is confirmed by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And there is no doubt that sound intellect affirms speech for Allaah because it is <em><u>S</u>ifatul Kamaal</em> (hidden attribute of perfection) and negation of it is an attribute of deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan who was a foul person who appeared amongst the people and tried to cause them to doubt about the religion of Allaah and he commanded them with apostasy and disbelief. And from that is that he tried to cause them to doubt about the fact that Allaah speaks and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The speech of Allaah which is present is something created; <em>makhlooq</em>. He created it in the Preserved Tablet or He created it in Jibreel or He created it in Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is therefore just an ascription of a created thing to its creator just like saying <em>Baitullaah</em> (the House of Allaah) or <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (the she camel of Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said  ̶ may Allaah disfigure him. He said Allaah does not speak and the ascription of speech to Him is just an ascription of a created thing to its Creator. This is from his <em>mathhab</em> (position). And he also had the position of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Jabr</em> with regard to <em>Qadr</em> (predecree); that people are compelled to do their deeds, no free will. And he had the position of with regard to denying the names and attributes and he also had a position with regard to denying the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the <em>Qur·aan</em> also. So he was a filthy apostate who appeared with the likes of this falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>mathhab</em> was derived from the Jews as was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah in the introduction to <em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>. And Al-Jahm, he was not the one who began this <em>mathhab</em>. Before him, there was Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham; he is the one who initiated this repulsive saying. And he took it from <u>T</u>aaloot; the Jew and <u>T</u>aaloot took it from Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am, the Jew who did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this saying is derived from the Jews, those who distort the speech of Allaah, away from its correct meaning, so this foul <em>mathhab</em> should not be considered something inexplicable when its source is known that it is from the Jews. They infiltrated it amongst the Muslims by means of this foul man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham, the one who was killed by Khaalid al-Qasree on the Day of <em>Eid ul-A<u>d</u>haa</em> as Ibn-ul Qayyim mentioned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[1]</span></a> So therefore Ibn-ul Qayyim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>And on account of that, Khaalid Al–Qasree slaughtered </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ja`ad on the Day of the Sacrifice </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Since he said Ibraaheem was not Allaah’s chosen beloved one</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>No, and nor was Moosaa one who He spoke to and drew close </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>So every person of Sunnah is thanked for that sacrifice</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">What an excellent thing Allaah has brought about through the sacrifice of this brother</span> </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[2]</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was taken from him by Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and it became ascribed to him because he is the one who propagated it but he is not the one who initiated it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of the Sunnah rebuked and criticized them severely (the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>). And they spoke sternly in that regard and this will follow inshaaAllaah, the part that comes after. However, with us now we have a part of this foul <em>mathhab</em>, which is negation of speech for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a problem arose with the People of the <em>Sunnah</em>, should it be said, “My recital of the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is created or is not created?” This is something which they introduced also amongst the Muslims. So should you say: “My recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created or should you say my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is not created or should you <em>tatawaqqaf</em> (withhold)? And say if what you mean is what is recited, that which is recited, then it is the speech of Allaah, it is not created. And if what is meant is a person’s own particular recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> then his own recital is a created thing and his voice is created. So therefore it must be mentioned with detail and it must be given then with detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the detail, which was stated by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bukhaariyy and a group of the verifiers. So do not say: my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created unrestricted and do not say it’s not created unrestrictedly and do not withhold. Rather, mention the answer with detail that <span style="color:#333399;">if what you mean is what I’m reciting then that is the speech of Allaah, that is not created or if what is meant is the person’s own particular recitation, his own particular voice then that is created. That is the detail</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side-point: And he quotes three famous lines from the Nooniyyah of Ibn-ul Qayyim, poem on `<em>aqeedah</em>, each line ending in <em>noon</em>, concerning this event that this man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham that he was killed by Khaalid Al-Qasree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side-point: They mention this happened around the year 118 AH in Kufa that Khaalid Al-Qasree who was the governor in Iraq at that time that he slaughtered this evil person Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side-point: Some of the people of Knowledge mention is that this saying that we heard was taken by Jahm from Al-Ja`ad and he took it from Taaloot and he took it from Labeed. Then this Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am was a Jew. As we heard he did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his saying was taken from him by Taaloot; the Jew and from him, his student Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham took this saying, the saying of the Jahmiyyah. And from Al-Ja`ad was taken by his student Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and each was executed. We saw Al-Ja`ad being executed here and likewise Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, he was killed as well; his student but before that, each time before the person was executed or killed, he had a famous student who took the saying from him. So, Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, this saying was taken from him by Bishr al-Marisee and then he, Bishr al-Marisee, he taught this to A<u>h</u>mad ibn Abee Du`aad, the one who was at the head of those who tortured Imaam A<u>h</u>mad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just briefly with regard to the event; before the event that Khalid al-Qasree slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham on the Day of Sacrifices. He gave a <em>khutbah</em> to the people on the `<em>Eid</em> and he said: May Allaah accept your sacrifices for indeed I am going to sacrifice Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham and he came down and he slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this report: “There’s some speech from the scholars, is it established or not? This is reported by a number of the scholars in their books Ad-Daarimee in <em>Ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em> and Al-Bukhaariyy in his book <em>Khalq Af`alul-`Ibaad</em> and other books as well. Then Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>Mukhta<u>s</u>ar al-`Uluw</em>, Ath-Thahabee’s book <em>Al `Uluw</em>, the originate of it, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy comments, he mentions that the first chain of narration for this that there is weakness in it, there is unknown people in the chain. But then he said, however, the narration that comes after it, another narration with a different chain is better than it and perhaps therefore that is why the scholars state that this story definitely happened. Meaning, there is more than one chain of narration before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Translator’s side-point:  With regard to the explanation of Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after mentioning a number of evidences from the <em>Qur·aan</em> affirming that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is indeed the speech of Allaah, not created and the speech of Allaah is an attribute of His. Then he said: ‘And whoever says that anything from the attributes of Allaah is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> have affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Al-Laalikaa’ee referring to here Imaam Al–Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; famous book of `<em>aqeedah</em> mentioned from 550 scholars from the <em>Salaf</em> that they said: ‘Whoever says that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and whoever says that his recitation of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is something created then he is an innovator, a <em>Jahmi</em> (he is astray). And likewise, one who remains silent and doesn’t say whether it’s created or not created, he is also a <em>Jahmi</em> (astray). So what Allaah has informed is very clear that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is the speech of Allaah and whoever will not say that then he has belied Allaah in what He has informed of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s side point: Obviously the last part of the text here is taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times, <strong><em>“Whoever lives long amongst you will see great differing</em></strong>…<strong>”</strong> and the rest of the point taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Al-Irbaa<u>d</u> Ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, Abu Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 56: Point 98 (Start of Volume 2)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the scholars did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the lowly and despicable folk  (<em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah)</em> spoke concerning public affairs. And they spoke against the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared those who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/jahmiyyah-and-ruwaybidah-the-lowly-despicable-folk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the People of Knowledge did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah,” </strong></span>the Jahmiyyah; a definition of them has preceded already that they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan who propagated the foul saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and who openly proclaimed negation of the names of Allaah and His attributes and he had the saying of <em>Al-Irjaa`</em> (taking actions out of <em>eemaan</em>) and he had a foul <em>ma<u>dh</u>hab</em> (path).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his followers are called the Jahmiyyah as an ascription to al-Jahm. And from the worst, most ugly of their sayings is the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and denying the names and attributes of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and distorting the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger with falsehood; explaining it and distorting it with falsehood. So they (Jahmiyyah) are the most dangerous of the sects and the most ugly of the sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the People of Knowledge did not leave them alone, rather, they rebutted their doubts and refuted their sayings and demolished them. And this is present in the books of the People of Knowledge. From them is the refutation of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> upon the Jahmiyyah and this is present and is printed. And from them is the refutation of `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed ad-Daarimee upon Bishr al-Mareesee al-`Aneed and it is printed also. And from them is <em>Bayaanu Talbeesil-Jahmiyyah</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and from them is<em> Ijtimaa`ul Juyoosh Islaamiyyah `alaa Ghazwal Mu`attillah w’al Jahmiyyah</em> of Ibnul Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“until in the <em>Khilaafaa </em>(caliphate) of <em>Banul `Abbaas </em>(`Abbaasids),” </strong></span>in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon who was from the <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, evil occurred. And those who are not suitable to speak, spoke. They spoke with regard to knowledge and with regard to the fundamentals; those who are not suitable to speak. And if a person speaks about something other than his own speciality, then the affairs will be corrupted. So it is essential that no-one speaks about the affairs of the religion and of knowledge except the people who are specialised in it and the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affairs will not be rectified by chaos; by everyone speaking and claiming to have knowledge as is present now from those <em>muta`aalimeen</em> (pretenders to knowledge); those who ruminate (think deeply) upon questions of <em>`aqeedah</em> and speak about <em>eemaan</em> and what is the reality of <em>eemaan</em>. And they speak about things which they have no right to speak about at all. They have no knowledge and they do not learn with the scholars. Rather, they just learned by themselves and they rely upon their own understandings and they start laying down principles from themselves and from their own understandings. So, the affair is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“so then in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) started speaking about <em>amaril `aammah</em> (affairs of the masses and the people).”</strong></span> This occurs in a narration; meaning this will be from the signs of the Last Hour that public affairs are spoken about by those who are not known for `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) and their speaking is one of the signs of the Hour. So it is not right that such a person should speak about the public affairs and about the general matters, which affect everybody. No-one should speak about that except for the People of Knowledge; those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And this should not be entered into by everyone just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if some matters relating to public safety or fear come to them, they broadcast it, and if only they had referred it back to the Messenger and to those in charge with authority amongst them, then the reality of the matter would be known to those who are able to verify and deduce.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa·(4), <em>aayah</em> 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So public affairs affecting the nation (<em>ummah)</em> are not to be spoken about except by the people who are specifically qualified to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they spoke against the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.”</span> </strong>They interfered even in the <em>A<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>, they make attacks upon them and they write works and declare things authentic and declare things weak. And they are not known for knowledge and they did not learn knowledge and they are not from the narrators of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> nor from the Imaams of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>. So they are therefore, <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>; these lowly despicable folk. They stand up and they start speaking about the most dangerous thing, which is the science of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the knowledge of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared anyone who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>What is meant by <em>qiyaa<u>s</u></em> (analogy) here is <em>al-qiyaas ul-baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false analogy). As for <em>al-qiyaas u<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct analogy) then that is from the underlying fundamental evidences with the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, false analogy such as drawing analogy between the Creator and the creation or making analogy between a matter and another matter, which has no connection to it and does not have a common underlying factor. The like of that is false analogy. Because <em>al-qiyaas</em> (analogy) is joining a matter (<em>far·`a)</em> which we do not find a text for, joining it to a matter which there is a text for (<em>asl)</em> and so applying a ruling to it on account of there being an underlying factor (`<em>illah)</em>, common to both of them. So if there is no <em>`illah</em> (common underlying factor) common to both things then it will be a false and futile analogy.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Point Number 98 continued]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the ignorant, the inattentive and the ones having no knowledge entered into their saying. So therefore they entered into disbelief without knowing. And the <em>ummah</em> was ruined in a number of ways, committed disbelief in a number of ways, committed heresy in a number of ways and went astray in a number of ways and it split and innovated in a number of ways. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and what his companions were upon who did not go beyond what they had been upon and did not overstep their affair. Whatever sufficed them sufficed him and he did not wish to turn away from their way and their position. He knew that they were upon the correct Islaam and the correct true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>. So he followed them in his religion and found peace. And he knew that the religion lies in following; <em>taqleed</em> and that those who are meant to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the ignorant people, the inattentive ones and the one having no knowledge entered into their saying.” </strong></span>Meaning, the door was opened for everyone. They began speaking about the affairs of knowledge right until now as you know on account of these satellite channels and this speech and this chaos with regard to knowledge has reached the extent that the common masses of people speak about the matters of knowledge and they raise doubts about the matters of knowledge. They raise doubts about the Islamic rulings. They raise doubts about the verdicts of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as has preceded, they declare those who disagree with them to be disbelievers to the extent that they declare the earlier Imaams to be disbelievers and to being ignorant people and to the extent that some of them say, “I am a person and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal was a person. We are men and they were men. Maalik was a man and I am a man!” This is the level that the situation has reached with them that there is no special distinction for the saying of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“To the extent that they committed disbelief in a way which they did not know.”</span> </strong>They committed disbelief in a way that they did not know. So a person may say a saying of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and he does not know that it is a saying of disbelief on account of his being ignorant. So he says that which is disbelief and he promotes disbelief and he doesn’t even know that it is disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> on account of his having entered into something which he is not proficient in. So the danger is very great for him and for the nation (<em>ummah)</em>. If the danger were just restricted to him; the one who is speaking, it would be easier but the problem is that this spreads throughout the <em>ummah (</em>nation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>ummah</em> (nation) became ruined through a number of different ways and committed disbelief in a number of different ways,” </strong></span>meaning, they confused and deceived the <em>ummah</em> (nation) and they entered weaknesses into it until there came to be from them those people who adopt sayings of disbelief and they say, “<em>these are sayings of scholars</em>” just as they say about the saying of Al-Jahm and the Mu`tazilah to the extent that they write in the newspapers, then they say about the true scholars (`<em>ulemaa)</em>, “<em>you people, you restrict the truth to just yourselves and you throw away the sayings of the Imaams such as Ibn Seenaa and Ibn `Arabee and Al-Jahm Ibn <u>S</u>afwaan. And those people are scholars who have their value</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they committed heresy in different ways and went astray in different ways and they split and they innovated in different ways.” </strong></span>All of these calamities were on account of the ignorant people entering into the matters of knowledge and on account of having little fear of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So when they had very little fear of Allaah, they entered into these matters. And therefore one of the <em>Salaf</em> said: &#8220;<em>Their wara`(piety) was very slight so that is why they spoke</em>.” As for a person who fears Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then he doesn’t enter into anything if he is not proficient in it and not from its people, in particular the affairs of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and upon what his companions were upon and do not step beyond any of them.” </strong></span>They were not secure from these calamities, from disbelief and deviation and misguidance and diverting from the correct way and from mutual enmity and from cutting off ties with each other. No-one was safe from these calamities <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except</strong> </span>those who adhered to that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who are upon that which I and my companions are upon.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And who found sufficiency in whatever sufficed them,” </strong></span>and it is the Book and the Sunnah and that which the <em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h </u></em><u>(</u>the righteous predecessors) were upon, from the companions and the <em>taabi`een </em>and the most excellent generations and the Imaams. However, the problem lies in those people who say, “<em>They were men and we are men. And their speech has no distinction over our speech</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he knows that they were upon the correct Islaam and upon the correct <em>eemaan</em> (true faith).” </strong></span>Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the <em>Muhaajireen</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and those who followed them upon goodness.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever wants salvation then this is the path to it. And the one who does not want salvation will have whatever he chooses for himself but the harm is not restricted to him; rather, he will also carry the sins of the people along with his own sin. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لِيَحْمِلُوا أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۙ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they will carry their burdens of sin completely on the Day of Resurrection and they will carry from the sins of those whom they misled also without knowledge. Indeed what an evil burden they will bear! </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the companions and the most excellent generations are the ones who were upon correct Islaam and the correct religion. So how can you abandon them and go instead for those for whom there is no guarantee that he is upon the correct religion and that he is upon the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So this person followed them in his religion and was at peace.”</span> </strong><em>Qalladahum</em>; meaning he followed them, <em>ittaba-’ahum</em>.</p>
<p><strong> وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… and those who followed them upon good. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is <em>ittibaa</em>`; following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this person knows that the religion is just in following and that the ones to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong></span>As we have mentioned, what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is correct <em>taqleed</em>; following, which is <em>ittibaa`</em> just as Yusuf `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُون</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have left the religion of a people who do not truly believe in and worship Allaah alone and who deny the Hereafter. And I have followed the religious way of my forefathers; Ibraaheem and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yusuf (12), <em>aayah </em>37 and 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>` (following) of the righteous predecessors (<em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h)</u></em>, this is the truth and there is no blame at all for following them. Indeed blameworthiness is only for those who follow the people who are not deserving of being followed and who take as an example those who are not befitting to be taken as examples.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Before the Last Hour, there will be years of deception in which a liar will be believed and a truthful person will be taken to be a liar and in which a treacherous person will be trusted and in which a trustworthy person will be taken to be treacherous. And in it the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> will speak. So it was said, “Who are the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>?” So he said, “The little evil one who speaks about the public affairs.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafi<u>dh</u> ibn Katheer said in <em>an-Ni<u>h</u>aayah fil-Fitan w`al-Milaa<u>h</u>im</em>; its chain of narration is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for one of the verifiers of the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad; Shuayb al-Arna`ut, he said in his checking of the <em>Musnad</em> of A<u>h</u>mad, the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> is <em><u>h</u>asan</em>, this particular chain is weak as it contains Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin Is<u>h</u>aaq who is <em><u>h</u>asan</em> in <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> but he was a <em>mudallis</em> and he reports it here, he just says, “from”, he doesn’t say that he directly heard it from his Shaykh, he said, “from him”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an addition to what occurs here, this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> also occurs as a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Ibn Maajah (4,042) and by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad also and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (1,887) because it has a number of chains which support it. He also authenticates a <em>hadeeth</em> of Aws ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar wording, reported by al-Bazzaar and a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and he brings that in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aheehah</em> (2,253).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said, literally the beginning here that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the people of knowledge continue rebutting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until it was the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>,” </strong></span>he was here narrating the condition that was present and the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul Abbaas</em>, the beginning of it was upon good but then the affairs changed after the year 200 when the <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon accepted the call of the Mu`tazilah and became convinced that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created and he called the People of Knowledge to accept this innovation and to accept this saying, which is <em>kufr </em>(disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore fitnah; tremendous trial occurred, which continued from the year 200 onwards and for 12 years of the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon and Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and Al-Waathiq until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was taken on by Al-Mutawakkil `ala-Allaah and then the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> and the carriers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> had some respite then and it was the People of Falsehood who were then curbed of doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Al-Mutawakkil passed away, after that time then the <em>Khaleefas</em> began to lose their authority and the <em>Khilaafah</em> became just a name without any reality. They became an outer form without a true reality behind it and that was because the Turks gained ascendancy and they took hold of the reality of authority and came to actually control the <em>Khulafaa</em>·. They could bring whoever they wanted and appoint him and they could kill this one as they wished and then after that authority passed away from the Turkish people and passed to <em>Banu Booyaa</em>. [Translator’s side point: <em>Banu Booyaa</em> ruled roughly from the year 325 AH till about the year 450 AH.]. Then to <em>Al-Jaraakisaa</em> (the Circassians) until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was ended in the year 656.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the saying of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was realised that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“We are a people who used to be the most humiliated people but then Allaah gave us strength and honour through Islaam so whenever we seek to attain honour by other than that which Allaah gave us honour through, then Allaah will humiliate us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and he declared it authentic from `Umar and likewise Ath-<u>Th</u>ahabee agreed.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad finished by saying, “Except for the fact that the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al-Jamaa`ah</em> and the people of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the people of true `<em>aqeedah</em> have not ceased to be established upon their `<em>aqeedah</em>, not being harmed by whoever opposes them. And therefore, he (meaning the author; al-Barbahaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) therefore made an exception by saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his command what he was upon and his prohibition…”</strong></span> to the end of the saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Checking has preceded and the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as we had before was reported by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and al-<u>H</u>aakim and others and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> being part of the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of `Irbaa<u>d</u> ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and being declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> makes a point here, he said the point of slight objection to a wording, he said, the author’s saying here, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and you should know that the religion is just <em>taqleed</em>,” </strong></span>the point of objection is to be raised against here for the wording because <em>taqleed</em> means to follow without a proof. So if he had said the <em>deen</em> is <em>ittibaa</em>`; used this word, the religion is to follow the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> upon the understanding of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>ummah</em> from the companions and <em>taabi`een</em> and those who followed them upon good from the bearers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and narrations. This wording would’ve been what is correct because it conforms to what Allaah has commanded with in His Book when He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is My straight way so therefore follow it and do not follow the divergent paths, which will take you away from His path. He has enjoined you with that so that you are a people who are dutiful to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p><strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what is being sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any others besides Him in disobedience to Allaah. Little it is that you take admonition.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>`; following for the <em>Salaf</em>, those who were before us; upon the narration, upon proof, upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, this is the truth and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 96</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> and marrying a woman merely to make her lawful for her previous husband (<em>al-Isti<u>h</u>laal)</em> are forbidden till the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/temporary-marriage-of-convenience-al-mutah-is-forbidden-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> (jurisprudence). However, he brought it here because it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). Because <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) is to declare as lawful something which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made forbidden. And what this term <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) means; to marry a woman for a certain set period whether it be long or short and after it, then the marriage ends automatically and does not require divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mut`ah</em>; this temporary marriage, it used to be permissible at the beginning of Islaam and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade it at the Battle of Khaybar.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Then he permitted it on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then he forbade it forever.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to begin with, it was lawful then it was made forbidden. Then it was permitted then it was forbidden forever. And the Muslims are united in consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> that it is forbidden and that it is <em>nikaa<u>h</u>un baa<u>t</u>il</em> (baseless marriage). And there is consensus of this nation that it is forbidden, no-one disagrees with regard to that except for the <strong>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Ja`firee Shee`ah</strong>. They are the ones who contradict with regard to it. And their differing is not counted and has no value. So there is consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) and text to show that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> is forbidden. It is a futile marriage and it has the ruling of <em>zinaa</em> (fornication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><em>“al-Mut`ah tan-nisaa,”</em> </strong>Why did Imaam al-Barbahaaree say <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em>, meaning <em>Mut’ah</em> of the women, excluding by that <em>Mut`ah</em> of Hajj, which is that a person does <em>Tamattu</em>`, performing `Umrah and then performing Hajj. This is not what is meant here, for Hajj <em>Tamattu</em>` is what was supported by the majority of the People of Knowledge and no-one disagrees with regard to it except a small number but as for <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em> of the women meaning temporary marriage, then it’s forbidden by consensus, no-one disagrees about it from those whom disagreement is counted. Whereas, Mut’ah in Hajj is a matter of fiqh but as for Mut’ah, which is temporary marriage, then it is a matter, which has a connection to aqeedah (creed and belief) because it is making permissible that which Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made forbidden.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Khaybar, the well-known battle against the Jews of Khaybar in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (4,261) and also reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,407) from Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade temporary marriage to the women on the day of Khaybar and he forbade eating the meat of domestic donkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <u>H</u>adeeth for that reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,406) from Sabrah al-Juhanee that, He was with Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O people, I have permitted you to take pleasure from the women and Allaah has forbidden that now until the Day of Resurrection. So, whoever has something from them then let that go on its way and do not take from anything that you have given to them.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded us with <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage) in the year of the conquest when we entered Makkah then we did not depart from it until he had forbidden us from it.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for the spread of ignorance in the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> century amongst the Arabs caused them to be lost, and they became an easy morsel in the hand of the one who wanted them.  However, when they were busy with knowledge it was not possible for anyone to divide them up and overcome them.’<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Zaydeeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever investigates the situation of the Rawafidah, will find that no one says what they say except the <em>Kuffar</em>.  The majority of scholars make <em>Takfeer</em> of the Rawafidah. The Zaydeeyah are <em>Mubtadia’</em>(Innovators), the term is not given except to the Zaydeeyah and also whoever becomes a Shi’ee. The Zaydeeyah do not have <em>Asaneed</em> (chains for narrations), rather their reliance is upon books which do not  have <em>Isnaad</em>.’<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 – </strong><strong>Rawafidah (Shia) and the Jews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the seventh and eighth century you would not find except the Rawafidah (Shia) in Madina and likewise in Makkah, this is what Ibn Taymeeyah, Dhahabi and Sakhawi mention.  I believe that there is no enemy of the Muslims the likes of the Rawafidah (Shia) and the Jews. The founding father of the Rawafidah was Abdullaah bin Saba and he was a Jew.  Shaykh ul-Islaam wrote a chapter in the book ‘<em>Minhaj as-Sunnah</em>’ explaining the resemblance of the Rawafidah (Shia) to the Jews. If the leaders from the Muslims had not used politics to deal with the Rawafidah and the Jews, they would not have been secure from their cunning evil.  The Rawafidah do not know anything about Islaam.’<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘a – The Rawafidah took their religion from the Jews, and their attacking the Companions is attacking Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – When the Asha’areeyah<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> affirmed seven <em>Sifaat</em> (Attributes) of Allaah, they did not do this because it is present in the Qur’aan, rather they affirmed them because the intellect did not oppose them, if they had affirmed them due to the Qur’aan then they would have affirmed the rest of the <em>Sifaat</em>.’<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – The Term ‘Rawafidah’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The evidence of the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth that the Ahadeeth which mention the word ‘ar-Rawafid’ are Ahadeeth which are lies, whereby this title was not applied except at the time of the Abbaseeyeen.’<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6 – <em>Takfeer</em> of the Rafidah<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed when Imam Ahmad was asked about the Rafidah he answered that they were <em>Kuffar</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said: ‘Some of the people of knowledge have said that the Rafidah are <em>Mubtadia’</em>(people of <em>Bida’</em>)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said: ‘This statement that they are people of <em>Bida’</em> is a light statement about them, since their actions are the actions of the <em>Kuffar</em> and likewise are their statements.’<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Rafidah say that Ali <em>–</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anhu</em><em>–</em> will be sent before the Day of Judgement.’  They mean in place of Isa <em>-alayhi as-Sallaam</em>.’<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Part One</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Compiled by Abu Abdurahman Makki<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, may praise and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah, upon his family, his Companions and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – al-Imam ‘Aamir ash-Sha’abee (d. 105 A.H.) – rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I warn you against misguided desires, and the most evil of them are the Rafidah. That is because from them there are Jews who immerse themselves into Islaam to try to prepare it to enter their misguidance just like when Paul the son of the King of the Jews immersed himself into Christianity in order to enter their misguidance into it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then ash-Sha’abee said: ‘<strong>The Rawafid did not enter into Islaam out of desire or from awe of Allaah but rather out of hatred for the people of Islaam</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Talha bin Mussarraf (d. 112 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Regarding the Rafidah, their women are not to be married nor is the meat from the animal they slaughter to be eaten because they are apostates</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Abu Hanifa (d. 150 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Jamaah is to prefer Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali and Uthmaan, and they do not belittle or find anyone deficient from amongst the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The Imam of Dar-al-Hijra Malik bin Anas al-Asbahi (d. 179 A.H.) -rahimullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever curses the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he has no part, [or he said: no share] in islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Al-Lailka’ee narrated that Imam Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever curses the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he has no reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Allaah – Azza wa Jal – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking Bounties from Allah and to please Him.</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>; the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who migrated with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Then Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">والذين تبؤوا الدار والإيمان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">والذين جاءوا من بعدهم يقولون ربنا اغفرلنا ولأخواننا الذين سبقونا بالإيمان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith</strong></span>&gt;&gt;<a title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reward is for these three types, but whoever curses the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then he is not from these three and he has no truthful right to be amongst these three.’<a title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – Al-Qadi Abu Yusuf -rahimullaah – (d.182 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>I do not pray behind a Jahmi, nor a Rafidi, nor a Qadri</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – AbdurRahman bin Mahdi -rahimullaah – (d. 198 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>They are two nations: al-Jahmeeyah and Rafidah.’ (Meaning not from the Muslim Ummah)</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Imam Shaafi’ee -rahimullaah – (d. 204 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>A Rafidi has no intercession, this is only for a Muslim</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – Muhammad bin Yusuf al-Faryaabi – rahimullaah- (d. 212 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I hold the opinion that the Rafidah and the Jahmeeyah are nothing but heretics (unbelievers)</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – Ahmad bin Yunus – rahimullaah – (d. 227 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Indeed we do not eat the meat of the animal slaughtered by a Rafidi, because to me he is an apostate.</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – Ahmad bin Yunus also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a Jew slaughtered a sheep and a Rafidi slaughtered one as well, then I would eat from the meat slaughtered by the Jew, and I would not eat from the meat slaughtered by the Rafidi because he has apostated from Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal said to a person about Ahmad bin Yunus: ‘Go to Ahmad bin Yunus since indeed he is Shaykh ul-Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – Imam as-Sunnah Ahmad bin Hanbal – rahimullaah – (d. 241 A.H.) was asked by his son Abdullaah bin Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I asked my father about a person who curses a person from the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, so he said:  ‘I hold the view that he is not upon Islaam</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – From Abu Bakr al-Marwathi who said: I asked Abu Abdullaah about the person who curses Abu Bakr, Umar and Aeysha?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: ‘I hold the view that they are not upon Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – From Abu Bakr al-Marwathi who said: I heard abu Abdullaah saying that Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Whoever curses the Companions of the Prophet – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – then he has no share, or he said: no share in Islaam</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khalaal said: AbdulMalik bin AbdulHameed informed me, who said, I heard Abu Abdullaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Whoever cursed [the Companions] I fear disbelief upon him, like that of the Rawafid</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Whoever cursed the Companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> then we do not find any security for him that he has indeed exited from the Deen</strong>.’<a title="" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 – Al-Khalaal said: Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: ‘I asked my father about a person who curses a man from the companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not hold him to be upon Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – Imam Ahmad also said about the Rafidah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They free themselves from the Companions of Muhammad <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> they curse them, belittle them and they make Takfeer (excommunication) of their leaders except four of them: Ali, Amaar, al-Miqdad and Sulayman, and the Rafidah have nothing to do with Islaam.’<a title="" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – Imam al-Bukhari -rahimullaah – (d. 256 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not care if I prayed behind a Jahmi and a Rafidi, or prayed behind a Jew and a Christian, and they are not given Salam, nor are they visited, or married into, nor is their testimony accepted and their slaughtered animals are not eaten.’<a title="" href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 – Abu Zura’a ar-Raazi (d. 264 A.H.) -rahimullaah- said: –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If you see a man belittling any one from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>; then know that he is a Zindeeq, and that is because to us the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is upon the truth, and the Qur’aan is true.  Indeed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> conveyed to us the Qur’aan and the Sunnan, indeed they want to criticise our witnesses so that they can invalidate the Book and the Sunnah, and these (critics) are foremost to be criticised and they are Zanadiqa (heretics).</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – Al-Lalka’ee narrated by way of AbduRahman bin Abi Hatim, that he asked his father and Abu Zura’a about the Madhab of the Sunnah and their beliefs which the people of knowledge found them upon in every country , and what was mentioned from what they said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And indeed the Jahmeeyah are Kuffar, and indeed the Rafidah, rejected Islaam.</strong>’<a title="" href="#_ftn22">[22]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – Abdullaah Ibn Qutayba ad-Daynoori al-Baghdadi (d. 276 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the extremism of the Rafidah in love for Ali which they exemplify in placing him in front of those whom the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>and his Companions placed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim is that Ali had a partnership with the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his Prophet hood, and they also claim that the Rafidah Imams have knowledge of the unseen of when someone will give birth and similar false statements, and secret matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters are gathered in that they are lies, kufr, extreme ignorance and stupidity.’<a title="" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>..So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu so and so then the times changed. The people deteriorated greatly and innovations became widespread, and there came to be many callers to other than the way of the truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/differing-and-fitan-increased-after-the-excellent-generations-had-passed-away" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu (tribe) of so and so. Then the times changed greatly and innovations became widespread,” </strong></span>Differing increased and <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations; discord) increased after the excellent generations had passed away until there came the time of the `<em>Abbaasiyyeen</em>; the `Abbaasid Khaleefahs and Al-Ma`moon al-`Abbaasee appeared amongst them.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> And he was followed by Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and by Al-Waathiq and they adopted the saying of the <strong><em>Jahmiyyah</em></strong>; this deviant sect and they wanted to force the people of the Sunnah upon the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And they killed some of the <em>Imaams</em> and they lashed others from them. However, the truth remains firm and all praise is for Allaah; it does not depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the callers to other than the way of the truth and of the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> became many.&#8221; </strong></span>Many people today say that they are <em>du</em>`<em>aat</em> (callers) and that they are <em>Jama`aat</em> (groups) and there are sects beneath this cover of <em>da`wah</em> (calling); being <em>du`aat</em> (callers) and what they want is to call the people to misguidance except for those whom Allaah has mercy upon from those who remain upon the call to the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology; way of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his call. Then this one is upon truth and this is the call of truth. Not everyone who carries the name of giving <em>da`wah</em> will be correct until his methodology (<em>manhaj)</em> is looked into, the methodology, which he precedes upon. So if he precedes upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, then he is a caller to truth. And if he is contrary to that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was upon in the methodology of <em>da`wah</em> then he is upon <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (falsehood). So a person should not be deceived by someone saying that he is from the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) for indeed there are <em>du`aat</em> (callers) who are at the gates of the Hellfire and whoever obeys them, they will throw him into it just as he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> And therefore, the author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“</strong><strong>and there became many callers to other than the way of truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.” </strong></span>Just as is the case now. There are many who claim that they are calling to Islaam underneath this cover. So if their <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) is looked into and their activities then they are found to be in total opposition to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And trials came about with regard to everything, which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> had not spoken about nor anyone from his companions </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em></strong><strong> (may Allaah be pleased with them). </strong></span>Speech became plentiful and differing and rumour mongering and claims of knowledge. However, all of this will fade into insignificance and what is indicated by the Book and the Sunnah will remain and it is the sound methodology and the straight path. However, this requires two matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>Al-`ilmu-Naafi’</em>: Beneficial Knowledge; <em>`ilm</em> by which that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions and those who followed them upon good were upon.</li>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> <em>As-<u>S</u>abaru Wath-Thabaat</em>: Patience and firmness and that you do not move away; depart along with the discord; trials and tribulations or along with the callers to misguidance. Rather, that you should be <em>thaabit</em> (firm) and be patient upon whatever strikes you from rebukes and blame or threats. As long as you are upon the truth then be patient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>وَاصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا أَصَابَكَ ۖ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have patience upon whatever befalls you. Indeed that is from those affairs which Allaah has firmly commanded. </strong></span>(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator&#8217;s side point: At the beginning of the time of the `<em>Abbaasids</em> and this <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon, he became the <em>Khaleefah</em> in the year 198; the end of the 2nd century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s footnote: This is part of the <u>h</u>adeeth of <u>H</u>udhayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it contains the wording that <u>H</u>udhayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> said; the famous <u>h</u>adeeth about the different stages in the future, what will happen to this religion, we used to be upon good, we used to be upon evil, he mentions then that Allaah gave this good to us, will there be any evil after this good?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said within that <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I said, so will there be any evil after this good?” So he </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> said, “Yes, there will be callers at the gates of the Hellfire, whoever responds to them in that, they will cause him to be cast into it.” He said, “I said, O Messenger of Allaah, describe them to us.” So he said, “They have our skin and they speak with our tongue.” So, I say, “What do you command me if that reaches me?” He said, “That you adhere to the united body of the Muslims upon the truth and to their ruler.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This is how the religion was until the <em>Khilaafah</em> of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan. Then when `Uthmaan </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em></strong><strong> was killed, schism; splitting and differing and innovations came about. The people split into parties and sects. Amongst the people were those who remained upon the truth when the changes first started to occur; they spoke with it, acted upon it and called the people to it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388976028&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-killing-of-uthmaan-ibn-affan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is how the religion was till the time of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan.” </strong></span>In the lives of the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (the next generation after companions), those who opposed the truth kept themselves hidden and they concealed themselves amongst the people such as the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and other than them and that was on account of the strength of Islaam and the strength of the Muslims until the Jews infiltrated. A Jewish man from Yemen who was called Ibn As Sawdaa` `Abdullaah ibn Sabaa`; the Jew. So, he came to Al-Madeenah and he manifested Islaam in the caliphate of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and he began speaking ill of `Uthmaan in gatherings because he was just claiming to be a Muslim as a plot against Islaam.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he started spitting out his poison in gatherings and the foolish people attended and the scoundrels, evildoers and the ignorant ones. And some people or indeed many people desire vilification, they like to hear people being abused, been spoken ill of and they like <em>qeel wa qaal</em> (rumour mongering). So therefore they gathered around him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when his reality became known and he was expelled from Al-Madeenah, he went off to Egypt and he found a village in Egypt, which was famous for dissension, splits and the like. So he immersed himself in it and he spread his poison in it and he vilified; spoke ill of `Uthmaan. Then in the end, he organised a group of them having weapons and strength. So they came to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and raised objections to him and declared him to be in error. So `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> responded to them and refuted them; refuted their doubts. Then they went back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they rebuked themselves whilst they were on the way and they said we have achieved nothing then they went back to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and they encircled him whilst he was in his house and the companions wanted to defend the <em>Khaleefah</em>. However, `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> forbade that for fear of <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and for fear of shedding blood hoping that the affair could be dealt with upon the basis of discussion and examination. He wanted to convince them. However, when they saw that they could not reach anything by using evidence then they sprang upon him during the night whilst the rest of the people were sleeping and they killed him <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they saw that their false doubts had been refuted and that they were not going to be accepted then they ceased the opportunity at a time of inattentiveness. And most of the people were performing Hajj and the people still in Madinah were asleep in security and the matter was under discussion and being examined. So they sprang upon him by night, may Allaah disfigure them. They sprang upon in his house and they killed him as a martyr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> whilst he was reciting the Qur&#8217;aan and he had the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em>; the written copy of the Qur&#8217;aan so that his blood spilled onto the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. So then <em>fitnah</em> (discord) occurred.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this filthy one (Abdullaah ibn Sabaa), he claims that the <em>Khilaafah</em> should’ve been for `Aliyy and that it was not for Aboo Bakr nor for `Umar nor for `Uthmaan. Rather, that it should’ve been just for `Aliyy and that `Aliyy was the <em>wa<u>s</u>iyy</em> (the one personally appointed to take over) by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and that those people had wrongfully seized the <em>Khilaafah</em> and taken it by force from `Aliyy. And the amazing thing is that `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> did not claim this nor did he seek the <em>Khilaafah</em> nor did he say &#8220;I have more right to it&#8221;; rather, he gave the <em>bay`ah</em> (the pledge) and he heard and obeyed his brothers, the rightly guided <em>Khulafaa</em>· <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>ajma`een</em> <em>jamee`an;</em> all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then al-fitnah discord occurred between the Muslims and fighting occurred between the Muslims on account of this filthy one, this one who infiltrated the ranks of the Muslims. However, Allaah caused his hopes to become frustrated. It is correct that tribulations occurred between the Muslims, some of them were killed. However, this did not do anything to Islaam. Islaam and all praise is for Allaah remained strong and established and he did not damage Islaam at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he and the Jews did not damage this religion and all praise is for Allaah. Yes, some calamities occurred for the companions and discord and fighting, however, this was all in the cause of Allaah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>wa ar<u>d</u>aahum</em> (may Allaah be pleased with them and cause them to be pleased). And this filthy one did not really achieve anything and all praise is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a summary of the affair of the <em>fitnah</em> (discord), which came about on the killing of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And this is something which shows that it’s not permissible to rebel against the ruler and that rebelling against him brings about evil in the nation and the shedding of blood and the people have continued to suffer from <em>fitan </em>(discord) from that time till this time of ours now; and you know about the callers to discord, those who call to <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and to rebellion against the rulers and with the excuse of correcting the evil. The <em>Mu`tazilah</em> arose and the <em>Khawaarij</em>, all of them from this aspect and they still continue until this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So when `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was killed then schism; splitting and differing came about and innovations.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to beware of the callers to misguidance and their affair should not be treated lightly and that it is not permissible to speak against the rulers. And therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined hearing and obeying and not rebelling against those in charge of the affairs even if they are tyrannical and even if they oppress and even if they are sinful as long as they do not reach the level of clear and open <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). This is how Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the people became sects. So from the people were those who remained firm upon the truth when things first changed; and who spoke with it and acted upon it and called to it.” </strong></span>When the <em>firq</em> (sects) came about and differing, then Allaah caused the people of the truth to remain firm upon the truth and upon the Sunnah and they preceded upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> had been upon. And the other sects contradict it, what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions had been upon. So therefore they became deserving of the threat of the Fire in accordance with the degree of what occurred from them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically, the <em>Khawaarij</em> are those who rebelled against ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) in the 37th year of Hijrah (657 C.E.) and imputed <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) upon the arbitration that followed the Battle of Siffeen. They hated ‘Ali’s decision to end the <em>fitnah</em> which occurred with Mu’aawiyah (رضي االله عنه), calling ‘Ali’s acceptance of the arbitration a compromise. They also imputed <em>kufr</em> upon many of the <em>sahaabah</em> who accepted the arbitration. They did not even accept the whole of ‘Uthman’s (رضي االله عنه) Caliphate. This position stems from their misunderstanding of the Qur’aan. They deduced, wrongly, that major sins are <em>kufr</em> and thus forfeit salvation. Sin is a contradiction that nullifies faith! ‘Ali and the other <em>sahaabah</em> sinned in the eyes of the <em>Khawaarij</em> and that sufficed to nullify their state of belief! Their doctrine became famous in their rebellions against any Muslim leader who, in their eyes, committed a sin or a mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) informed us before his death of the emergence of this sect and that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>They will kill the Muslims and leave the idolaters. Should I live until they appear, I would kill them as the killing of the nation of ‘Aad</strong></span>.”[103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The <em>Khawaarij</em> are the dogs of the Fire.</strong></span>”[104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) delegated ibn ‘Abbaas ( رضي االله عنهما) to call them to the truth. He succeeded in convincing several thousands of them. Those who rejected continued to spread mischief even after ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) warned them against it. He finally fought them in the battle of an-Nahrawaan (38Hj/658) and only few of them escaped and continued the secession. ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) was himself killed by a Kharijite by the name of Ibn Muljam. They split into many groups and today they survive in ‘Oman, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and in Tanzania and they are known as the <em>Ibaadiyyah</em> (<em>ibadi</em> Kharijism).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> sect was later influenced by scholastic theology and its principles became very close to those of the <em>Jahmite</em> and <em>Mu’tazilite</em> sects. They center upon the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Imputing <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali, ‘Uthmaan and other sahaabah  (رضي االله عنهم أجمعين)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The right to rebel and fight the Muslim rulers who may err or sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Justifying the rebellion and fight against disobedient Muslims (rulers and/or ruled) and that it is permissible for them to secede from the general body of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) They believe that the Qur’aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Qur’aan is the literal Word of Allaah Who uttered it in letter and sound and which He Spoke to Jibreel (alaihissalam), directly without a mediator, and who then brought it down to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). The Qur’aan is neither the word of Jib reel nor the word of Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) They distort the meanings of Allaah’s Attributes by resorting to figurative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Like the twelver <em>Shee’ites</em> and other deviant sects, they deny that the believers will see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. This contradicts what is asserted in the Qur’aan and authentic <em>sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) Imputing <em>kufr</em> on the Muslims who commit major sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) The majority of the <em>Khawaarij</em> deny the actual punishment in the grave that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) inflicts upon those who deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned are some of the major characteristics of the <em>Khawaarij</em>. I intended to give the reader some background about this very dangerous sect and which has influenced many Muslim groups and parties in our times leading to bloodshed in many parts of the Muslim World. The bloody confrontations are hard to stop in some places and that has distorted the view of Islam in many parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth, however, is emerging and will <em>inshaa’ Allaah</em> completely emerge on the hands of the true followers of Islam who are working hard to correct this problem with the good word without compromising the ‘<em>aqeedah</em> nor the <em>manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should be able to present the truth without imitating the <em>kuffaar</em> and their ways. In this respect, the words of Imaam Maalik (رحمه االله) are remembered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nothing will benefit this ummah to come except that which benefited its early generations.”</strong> [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the correct creed, methodology and righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit is that the Muslim should be aware that the principles of many of these sects are still alive and propagated by certain individuals and/or groups, and accordingly the believer must be cautious. [106]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 80</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that heresy, disbelief, doubts, innovations, misguidance and confusion about the religion have not occurred except through rhetorical theology (<em>al-kalaam)</em> and the people of rhetorical theology and through argumentation, debating, disputing and self-amazement. And how can a man boldly enter into debating, disputing and argumentation when Allaah, the Most High says:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>مَا يُجَادِلُ فِي آيَاتِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None dispute regarding the aayaat of Allaah except those who disbelieve.</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah-Ghaafir (40), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah 4</em><span style="font-size:1rem;">)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So, upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and remain silent.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of this has preceded and a warning against it.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So what is upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and remain silent.”</span> </strong>Upon you is to submit to the speech of Allaah and to the speech of His Messenger and to withhold from argumentation and raising doubts because that is prohibited. Indeed it will increase confusion. Take hold of the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger and be satisfied with that so that you are guided and therefore be at peace from whisperings, doubts and false ideas and you will come to be upon clear insight. So Allaah sent down this Qur&#8217;aan as a clarification of everything.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to <em>al-kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) then <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to the meaning of <em>kalaam</em>; it means logic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Page 125, for this 1<sup>st</sup> volume, point number 11.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to these Points at the below Links:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Point 10:</strong> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs/">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs</a></p>
<p><strong>Point 11: </strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-is-an-innovation-and-misguidance/">Speculative speech (kalaam) about Allaah, the Most High, is an innovation and misguidance</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: Explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said: The author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that there has not been any heresy or any disbelief,”</strong></span> I say, “Restricting heresy to be a result of <em>al-kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) and to the people of rhetorical theology and to the people of disputing and argumentation, this refers to what’s mostly the case. However, indeed there are cases of heresy and disbelief, which come about for other reasons besides <em>kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology). And we seek Allaah’s refuge from all the causes of heresy and disbelief and doubts and innovations, Aameen. However, this is what is generally the case with regard to a person who learns <em>kalaam</em> (rhetorical theology) and those who learn the different forms of debating and argumentation and self-amazement. And what is obligatory is to not be amazed at one’s self. And a person’s being outstanding in debating and argumentation is something which is blameworthy in the legislation unless it is to make the truth clear. And there occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth from the a<u>h</u>aadeeth of `Aa`ishah<em> ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The most hated of men to Allaah is the argumentative quarrelsome person.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (2457) and Muslim (2668).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the narration of At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah hates that person who is very eloquent from the men, the one who moves his tongue around just as the cows move their tongues around.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Tirmi<u>th</u>ee (2,853) and declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the author<em> ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">How can a person be bold upon argumentation and disputing</span></strong> when Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>مَا يُجَادِلُ فِي آيَاتِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None dispute regarding the aayaat of Allaah except those who disbelieve.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah-Ghaafir (40), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah 4</em><span style="font-size:1rem;">)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So upon you is to submit and to be pleased and satisfied with the narrations and to withhold and be silent.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I say &#8211; what is befitting for the Muslim is to submit to whatever comes from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and to withhold and be silent whatever is besides that knowing that submission to what occurs from the bringer of the legislation <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> should be a submission of <em>ri<u>d</u>aa</em> (being pleased and satisfied) and based upon acceptance and <em>eemaan</em> and attesting to the truth, acting upon whatever requires action from it and believing whatever it necessitates that we believe in. Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَالْعَصْرِ</strong><br />
<strong>إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By time, mankind is in loss except those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) and work righteous and correct deeds and they encourage each other with the truth and they encourage each other with patience.</span> </strong><span style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Asr, </span><em style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="text-align:justify;font-size:1rem;"> 1-3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of `<strong><em>aamanoo</em> </strong>is <strong><em><u>s</u>addaqoo</em></strong>: they believe and attest to the truth.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 64</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when children are afflicted by anything in the life of this world then they feel pain. And that is mentioned because Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id said &#8220;<em>they do not feel pain</em>&#8221; and he lied.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378718403&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/when-children-are-afflicted-by-anything-in-the-life-of-this-world-then-they-feel-pain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is mentioned on account of those who say that children do not feel any pain. And he mentioned this to refute this man and this man it is said that he was from the <em>Khawaarij </em>also<em>. </em>And the <em>Khawaarij</em> have even more surprising things than these worthless sayings on account of their ignorance and on account of their pretence to knowledge. When a child suffers something, he screams and he cries and he calls out for help and this is a proof that he indeed feels pain and this is something witnessed and felt. However, this man has strange sayings and from them is this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Al <u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> ibn <u>H</u>ajar said in Lisaan ul-Meezaan: &#8220;Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id ibn Zayd al-Ba<u>s</u>ree al-Zaahid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was mentioned by Ibn <u>H</u>azm in <em>Al-Milal W’al Ni<u>h</u>al</em> as being one of the <strong><em>Khawaarij</em> </strong>that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“With regard to every sin, even a small sin, even a slight lie which a person told as a joke that the person who does it is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), a <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) from the People of the Hellfire except that if he is from the people who fought at Badr then he will be a <em>kaafir</em>, a <em>mushrik</em> but he is from the People of Paradise”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his student `Abdullaah ibn `Eesaa used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“The insane person and the children and the animals never ever feel any pain on account of every ailment or anything else because Allaah never oppresses anything even by the extent of a tiniest ant.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) quoted this matter of pain from Bakr himself. From his foul sayings is that, “Whoever steals anything even to the amount of a mustard seed will remain in the Hellfire forever along with the disbelievers” and Ibn Qutaybah refuted this at length.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1 – al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon &amp; the Rafidah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>a)</b> ‘In the past I heard about the group al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon who had gathered in the era of King Farooq <a title="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and agreed upon a point that they clarify, which is that the <i>Rafidah</i> (the Shia) are regarded as a school of thought from the schools of thought of the Muslims, and therefore, they must be included amongst the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon.  This is why they were the ones who aided the Khomeni revolution and were happy with it, and they said there is no Islaam except with him (Khomeni).’<a title="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>b)</b> Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">‘Indeed the Ikhwan al-Muslimoon are from the helpers of Khomeni and the <i>Rafidah</i> (Shia).’<a title="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3 – Are al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon &amp; the Tableegh from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who are the <i>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah</i>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They are those who adhere to what the Companions were upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner asked: ‘Are the Salafiyoon, the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Yes, <i>as-Salafeeyah</i><a title="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> is the Sunnah and the <i>Jammah</i>; because the meaning of <i>Salafeeyah</i> is adhering to what the <i>Salaf as-Salih</i> were upon in the past.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Shaykh, regarding the Ikhwan group and the Tableegh are they from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Everyone who is upon a thought which opposes the Ahl-ul-Sunnah, then he is not from them, therefore the <strong>Ikhwan group and the Tableegh are not from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah</strong>, because they have thoughts which oppose the Ahl-ul-Sunnah.’<a title="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4 – Doubts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not come close to Jamat al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon since everything they have is doubtful.’<a title="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5 – Sayyid Qutb</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>a)</b> A man asked Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are some people who identify Sayyid Qutb with the title ‘Reviver’?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh disapproved of this title and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What did Qutb revive? Did he revive <i>Tawheed</i>? Meaning did he call to <i>Tawheed</i>?  Or did he revive the call to judge by what Allaah has revealed, and that was by authoring a book, actually all his speech was philosophy.’<a title="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>b) </b> Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Sayyid Qutb has a lot of <i>Hizbeeyah</i> and many customers.’<a title="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6 – Muhammad Qutb</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Muhammad Qutb the blood brother of Sayyid Qutb is a dangerous Ash’ari.  He authored a book of <i>Tawheed</i> for the Saudi education ministry and this book was all rhetoric and philosophy.’<a title="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7 – Surooreeyah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Surooreeyah are a group from the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimoon who broke away from them and live in London.’<a title="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 43</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>ومن زعم أنه يرى ربه في دار الدنيا فهو كافر بالله عز وجل</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And whoever claims that he sees his Lord in this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374551685&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-he-saw-his-lord-in-this-world-then-he-is-a-disbeliever-in-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever claims that anyone can see Allaah in this world, seeing Him with their eyes not seeing Him in a dream then he is a disbeliever; <em>kaafir</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High cannot be seen in this world and therefore when <em>kaleemullaah</em>, the one to whom Allaah spoke, Moosa <em>alayhissalam</em>:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِي أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَٰكِنِ انظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي</p>
<p>لَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Moosaa (`<em>alayhissalaam</em>) said, “Oh my Lord, show Yourself to me so that I may look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me, however look at the mountain and if it remains settled at its place then you will see Me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one can see Allaah in this world (<em>dunya)</em>. This is a point of consensus (<em>ijmaa)</em> amongst the scholars. Rather, seeing Allaah will be in the Hereafter because the people in this world are weak, they are not able to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because of their weakness and therefore when Allaah manifested Himself to the mountain, it shattered and became dust. So, how about the son of Aadam who is made of flesh and blood?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for in the Hereafter, Allaah will give to the believers strength through which they will be able to see Allaah and they will delight in seeing Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, seeing Allaah in the Hereafter is established and is <em>mutawaatir</em> (quoted by a huge number of people at each level of transmission) is established for the believers. But as for in this world then no one will see Allaah with His eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disagree whether the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw Him on the night of the ascent through the Heavens or did not see Him. And what is correct or the great majority are upon is that the Messenger did not see Him with His eye but rather, he saw Him with his heart and with his insight because no one can see Allaah in this life, because Allah is greater than that anyone should see Him in this life and therefore when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Did you see your Lord on the night of the ascent (mi`raaj), ascent through the Heavens?” He said, “Noorun Anna Araahu.” (Light, how could I see Him?) ”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim <u>h</u>adeeth no. (178) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> that the Prophet responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Light, how could I see Him?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“His screen is light, if He were to uncover it then the shining light of His face would consume whatever his gaze came upon from His creation.</strong>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>H</u>adeeth also reported by Muslim (179) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author,  &#8216;<em>Whoever claims that he can see His Lord in the life of this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;</em>.  I say, this claim has been claimed by many of the <strong>heretic <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who say that they see their Lord and they see the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and take from him and take from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic directly and they believe that they are in a station higher than the station of Messengership and whoever claims this claim then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). There is no doubt about his disbelief and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> likewise mentions the same point that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the claim of the <strong>extreme <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who claim that they can take knowledge directly from Allaah, the Most High by way of Kashf and who claim that they can obtain knowledge of the hidden and unseen (<em>ghaib)</em> directly from Allaah, the Most High, this point refers to the like of them and that claim is disbelief.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 32 &amp; 33 : Point 42</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وكل ما سمعت من الآثار شيئا مما لم يبلغه عقلك نحو قول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قلوب العباد بين إصبعين من أصابع الرحمن عز وجل وقوله إن الله ينزل إلى السماء الدنيا وينزل يوم عرفة وينزل يوم القيامة وإن جهنم لا يزال يطرح فيها حتى يضع عليها قدمه جل ثناؤه وقول الله تعالى للعبد إن مشيت إلي هرولت إليك وقوله خلق الله آدم على صورته وقول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأيت ربي في أحسن صورة وأشباه هذه الأحاديث فعليك بالتسليم والتصديق والتفويض والرضا ولا تفسر شيئا من هذه بهواك فإن الإيمان بهذا واجب فمن فسر شيئا من هذا بهواه ورده فهو جهمي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And whenever you hear something from the narrations, which your intellect cannot fully comprehend such as the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and His saying:</span>  <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allaah descends to the lowest heaven and He descends on the Day of `Arafah and He will descend on the Day of Resurrection and that the Hellfire will continue to have people cast into it until He, the Majestic and Praise will place His foot upon it”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and the saying of Allaah the Most High to the servant: </span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“if you come towards Me walking, I will comes towards you running.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His saying <strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon His image.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the most excellent form” </strong></span><span style="color:#993300;">and the like of these <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then upon you is to submit and to believe and to consign the how to Allaah and to be pleased and do not explain anything from this based upon your desires since having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory so whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a <em>Jahmee</em>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-attributes-of-allaah-the-creed-of-ahlus-sunnah-wal-jamaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts of the <em>sifaat</em> (attributes) that are established for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them just as they come upon their reality without interfering with them with your intellect and saying this does not befit Allaah. Allaah is declared free of that and this is resemblance; <em>tashbeeh</em>, as is said by the <em>Mu’attilah</em>; deniers of the attributes or that you believe that Allaah resembles His creation as is said by the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who declare the Creator to be like the creation. So each of the two groups are upon misguidance.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Mu`attilah</em>;</strong> those who deny the attributes, they went beyond the limit in <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Allaah free) to such an extent that they denied the names and attributes in order to flee away from <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) they claimed.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mumaththilah</em>;</strong> those who liken Allaah to the creation, they went beyond the limit in affirming to such an extent that they likened Allaah to His creation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">Both of these positions are <em>baatil</em> (false and futile).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the position of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is <em>al-wasa<u>t</u></em> (the middle and justly balanced position), they affirm the names and attributes for Allaah with affirmation without <em>tashbeeh</em> (without likening Allaah to the creation) and they negate from Him any resemblance to a created being declaring Him free of imperfections but without denying the attributes. This is the position of the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah W`al Jama`ah</em>. In accordance with His saying He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who liken Allaah to the creation, <strong>“there is nothing like Him.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He, Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mu`attilah</em>; those who deny the attributes and the <em>aayah</em> proves that affirming the names and attributes does not necessitate <em>tashbeeh </em>(resemblance) to the creation nor <em>tamtheel </em>(His being like) the creation and the fact that the people affirm whatever attributes He has affirmed for Himself or His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, we affirm those attributes and that in no way necessitates that we have likened Him to the creation or declared Him to be resemblance to the creation. This is the correct methodology with regard to the matter of <em>Al-Asma Wa-Sifaat</em> (names and the attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like such as <strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> you should affirm <em>a<u>s</u>aabi`</em> (the fingers) for the Most Merciful as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth and you should not say that they are like the fingers of the created being for this is <em>tashbeeh</em> (likening) Him to the creation, we declare Allaah free of it. Rather, we affirm it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High not like the fingers of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we affirm the <em><u>H</u>adeeth Qudsee</em> in which Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever comes to me walking, I come to him running.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning whoever hastens towards My pleasure and towards obedience to Me then I will hasten to forgive his sins and to carry out his needs. so the meaning of <em>harwalah</em> (running) is not the meaning that is well-known with us but rather it is explained by the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth by His saying, <strong>“If he were to ask Me, I would certainly give to him and if he were to ask My refuge, I would certainly grant him refuge.” </strong>So, the meaning of <em>al-harwalah</em> here is hastening to carry out the needs of His servant just as the servant hastens to the obedience to Allaah. So, does the servant run in reality or in meaning?<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains a refutation of some of those who are overhasty in affirming <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) for Allaah and this is the case of actions which are done as a response just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ ۙ سَخِرَ اللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So they (the disbelievers) mock at the believers, Allaah will mock at them.</span></strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah</em> 79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ</p>
<p>اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the hypocrites) say, “We were only mocking.” Allaah will mock them.</span></strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 14-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plotted and Allaah planned.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 154)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to have awareness of these tremendous principles so that a person may be upon clear insight and be aware of the position of the <em><strong>Salaf</strong> </em>with regard to it; those who are more firmly grounded than you and had more knowledge than you and a person should not try and make himself independent with his own understanding and his own intellect and affirm for Allaah things that he does not know about based upon what is apparent or based upon some unclear things, when there are decisive evidences, which explain and clarify them. So, it is obligatory to refer that which is unclear back to that which is clear and only those who are firmly grounded in knowledge will be guided to doing this. So, it is obligatory upon the student of knowledge and the beginner that he should not be hasty in these matters. Rather, he should withhold with regard to them and he should learn how he is to understand them upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf </em>and upon the clear, correct way. The <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) did not fall short in making the truth clear and in laying down principles and regulations. However, this requires learning and understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this also is his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And He descends on the evening of Arafah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they but await that Allaah should come to them screened by clouds and the angels come and the affair will be finished and to Allaah return all affairs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise with regard to Allaah, the Most High’s coming on the Day of Resurrection, it occurs also as a side point in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection to carry out judgement upon His servants.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We affirm these matters for Allaah upon their reality (<em><u>h</u>aqeeqah)</em> without interfering by defining the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). So, we do not burden ourselves with awareness of how He will descend and how He will come. So, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how), we do not enter into it but as for the meaning then it is <em>ma’qool</em> (understood) and therefore, when Imaam Maalik was asked about how <em>al-istiwaa</em>; how the ascending is when the questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner said to Imaam Maalik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“How did He ascend?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asking about <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said to him:</p>
<p><strong>الاستواء معلوم</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ascending is known.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning known with regard to its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik said:</p>
<p><strong>والكيف مجهول , والإيمان به واجب , والسؤال عنه بدعة</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And how is unknown and having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking about it is bid’ah (innovation).” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the sound methodology in the like of these affairs.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">soorah</span></em> (a form) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic in his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon his image.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Upon the form of the Most Merciful one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we affirm <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (a form or image) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic just as His Messenger affirmed it for Him in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the best form.”</strong></span> <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e this was in the world seeing Him in a dream in the best form. It contains affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (form or image) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High as befits His Majesty, not like the images of the created beings but rather, it is the <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (image or form) of the Most Merciful, the Majestic and Most High. So, these matters, we affirm them and we do not enter into them nor raise doubts about them nor delve further into them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>We consign or surrender the matter,” </strong>what is correct is to perform <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the <em>kayfiyyah</em></span> (how) it is, not <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Do not explain anything from these with your desires,”</strong> rather you must explain them with the correct meaning that befits Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. It should not be said that they are not to be explained. Rather, they are to be explained and their meaning is to be made clear and <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (surrender, consigning) is just with regard to how only. So, therefore you affirm <em>an-nuzool</em> (His descending) but you negate the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High comes on the Day of Resurrection to carry out the judgement just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah comes to them screened by clouds and the angels and the affair is concluded.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect will come to carry out judgement upon His servants. However, it is not like the coming of the created being and the coming of one of the creation. Rather, it is coming as befits His Majesty however He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>You should not explain any of this <em>Bi Hawaaka</em> (with your desires),” </strong>meaning do not explain them without knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> but as for your explaining them as necessitated by the evidences and referring that which is unclear back to that which is clear then there is no harm in it. But as for a person who is a beginner or an ignorant person then he should not enter into these very grave matters and these tremendous matters because this is a mistake and something very dangerous and I see many of the youth who feign knowledge being bold upon the matters of <em>`aqeedah</em> and they start to derive things from them and to speak about them and then they have enmity towards each other based upon these things and they break ties with each other when they disagree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, oh brothers, Allaah did not burden us with these matters. Upon you is to proceed upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf</em> and to say what they said. The books of <em>`aqeedah</em> are precisely written and all praise is for Allaah and printed and corrected and being studied and carefully checked so do not introduce things from yourselves and understandings from yourselves, you have been  sufficed having to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory,”</strong> having <em>eemaan</em> in the names of Allaah and attributes and His actions is obligatory. It is obligatory upon the servant and from having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is to have <em>eemaan</em> in His names and His attributes as befits His Majesty, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, the person who interferes in the matters of names and attributes, either with <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation) or with <em>tamtheel </em>(likening the Creator to the creation) or with <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (claiming ignorance about the meaning) or by bringing explanation from himself then this person has not believed in Allaah with true and full <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, his <em>eemaan</em> is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>So, whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a Jahmee,” </strong>the Jahmiyyah negated the names and attributes because they explain them in accordance with what befits the created being. There is no doubt that Allaah is declared free of that which befits the created being. So, they <strong>initially</strong> likened Him and then <strong>secondly</strong>, they negated based upon their <em>tamtheel</em> (having likened Him to the creation) since nothing was apparent to them from these texts except that which resembles the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore they denied them on account of that but as for if they had just said these texts contain attributes and names of Allaah in reality, that they are as befit Him, they are not like the names of the created beings nor like the attributes of the created beings, if they’d just followed this methodology, they would have been safe and sound but they were afflicted on account of their understanding and their desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Jahmiyyah, this is an ascription to Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan at-Tirmidhiyy or As-Samar Qandee, this well-known deviant, ascribed to the town of Tirmidh or the area of Samar Qand and he was the first one who manifested the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created and who had the saying that the names and the attributes are to be negated and who said that <em>eemaan</em> is just merely awareness in the heart to the rest of his sayings of misguidance and disbelief. So, whoever holds this belief then he is ascribed to him or it is to be said this person is a Jahmee in ascription to Al-Jahm.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Part of a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (2,654) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (7,405) and Muslim (2,675) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Whether <em>ar-harwalah</em> (running) is to be understood literally or it’s to be explained as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned in the likes of what occurs at the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth then as Shaykh al-Fowzaan <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, <span style="font-size:1rem;">This is also what was said by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Majmoo` al-Fataawa</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> and likewise you’ll find in the explanation of Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh upon </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> of Ibn Taymeeyah, the same explanation, he explained it that here in this particular hadeeth </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">al-harwalah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> means </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;">Allaah, the Most High’s hastening to carry out the needs of His servant and to forgive him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are others from the People of Knowledge who affirm <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) as an attribute for Allaah, the Most High as is apparent. From them was Imaam Ad-Daranee in his refutation of Al-Mareesee. Likewise, from the present day scholars Shaykh bin Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his <em>fataawa</em>; <em>Fataawa Noor `Alaa al-Darb</em>. Likewise, Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen in his fataawa and in his fataawa of al-`aqeedah in his book <em>Al-Qawaa`id al-Muthlaa</em> and Shaykh `Ubayd in his explanation, he agreed with that as well. Likewise, the <em>Saudi Lajna</em> also and likewise, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em>Silsilatul Huda Wan-Noor</em> tape series, all of them affirming this as an attribute for Allaah as befits His Majesty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation &#8211; &#8220;So, the <em>Salaf</em> had a great deal of speech concerning it, however, what has most right in the matter is that we should have eemaan in it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, meaning we affirm it as an attribute for Allaah as it stands and it is a proof for His responding to His creation, we affirm the attribute and what’s necessitated by the attribute is that Allaah indeed responds to His creation. So what is indicated by the attribute and its affect is His reward. So affirming the attribute <em>ar-harwalah</em> has more right than the saying of those who say that it means giving reward alone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (6,321) and Muslim (758) from Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Reported by Muslim (1,348) from `Aa`ishah that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no day when Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the day of Arafah and He indeed draws close then He boasts about them to the angels and says “what do those people want?”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (806) and Muslim (182), a long <u>h</u>adeeth containing the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And Allaah will come to them, He, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come and the angels in ranks.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> in his explanation mentioned a number of attributes and he applied the same principle to each one with regard to Allaah’s hand for example, he says, “The hand the meaning is known, the how is unknown, having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking how is an innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (6,227) and reported by Muslim (2,841) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> Reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer</em> and by Al-Haarith ibn `Abee Usaamah in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Ibn Khuzaymah in <em>Kitaab at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and it was declared authentic by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahaweyh as occurs in <em>Meezaan al-I’tidaal</em> of Imaam a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>Th</u>ahabiyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge such as Ibn Khuzaymah and some others declare this wording to be weak and likewise Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared this wording weak in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em>, <u>h</u>adeeth number 1,176 because of four weaknesses in the chain of narration. Ibn Khuzaymah himself pointed out three of the weaknesses and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentions the 4<sup>th</sup> weakness as well, Allaahu `Aalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and it should be volume 5, page 243 and by At-Tirmidhiyy in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mu`aadh <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it was declared authentic by At-Tirmidhiyy and he mentioned Al-Bukhaariyy declared it authentic also and likewise it was declared  <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> <strong>Side Point:</strong> The position of the People of the Sunnah is with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High then we say just as Imaam Maalik said as for the meaning of the attributes then we affirm the meaning but as regards to how the attribute is then we do not know so that is what we consign to Allaah, we give up on that, how it is; we do not know, we leave that to our Lord, Allaahu `Aalam. Whereas, as regards to the <em>Mufawwidah</em>; the deviant group then they  do the <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning i.e  they say we don’t know what the meaning is.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 32 : Point 41</strong><br />

<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>ولا يخرج أحد من أهل القبلة من الإسلام حتى يرد آية من كتاب الله عز وجل أو يرد شيئا من آثار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أو يصلي لغير الله أو يذبح لغير الله وإذا فعل شيئا من ذلك فقد وجب عليك أن تخرجه من الإسلام فإذا لم يفعل شيئا من ذلك فهو مؤمن ومسلم بالاسم لا بالحقيقة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And no one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> leaves Islaam unless he rejects an <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic or rejects anything from the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or praise to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah. So, if he does any of that then it is binding upon you to expel him from Islaam and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/no-muslim-exits-islaam-unless-he-perpetrates-that-which-nullifies-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> exits from Islaam except through committing one of the well-known <em>nawaaqid</em> (nullifiers of Islaam) along with any valid excuse being removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or through his rejecting anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, if he denies the Qur&#8217;aan or a part of it or the authentic Sunnah or a part of it or he rebuts anything from the Qur&#8217;aan or rebuts anything from the authentic Sunnah then he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy) because he is denying the truth of what has been said by Allaah and his Messenger as long as he is not <em>jaahil</em> (an ignorant person) or <em>muqallid</em> (someone just blindly following somebody else) or <em>muta`awwil</em> (somebody’s who’s misinterpreting), in which case the matter is made clear to him and when it is made clear to him and if he still persists then he is judged to be guilty of apostasy. And what is meant by <em>aathaar</em> (narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>or he rejects anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, meaning he becomes a disbeliever and this is a tremendous principle with the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. With it they contradict two groups;</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Khawaarij</em></strong> and the extremists, those who declare people to be disbelievers on account of <em>kabaa`ir</em> (committing major sins), which are less than shirk and,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Murji`ah</em></strong>, those who say that sin does not harm if a person has <em>eemaan</em> as long as the person is a believer; has eemaan in his heart then no sins will harm him even if he leaves off all actions and does not do any action then he will be a believer (<em>mu`min) </em>who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> <em>W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) then it is just as the author said that they are upon a middle and balanced position between the two groups. So they say that the <em>kabaa`ir </em>(major sins) vary. So, if it something from shirk or major <em>kufr</em> then he exits from the religion by consensus. And as for if it is not <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and if it is not shirk and it is not denying the Book of Allaah nor the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and it is not abandoning the prayer and it is not calling upon other than Allaah or sacrificing for other than Allaah, rather  it is just a major sin, it is less than that then this does not cause a person to exit from Islaam contrary to the <em>Khawaarij </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>. However, it does harm the believer and it will reduce his <em>eemaan</em> contrary to the <em>Murji`ah</em>, those who say that sin does not harm along with <em>eemaan</em>. So, this is the middle position, which harmonises between the texts of <em>Wa’eed (which mention a threat of punishment)</em> and the texts of <em>Wa‘ad</em> ( which mentions a promise of reward)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> took hold of the texts of the threat and they abandoned the texts of promise. Whereas, the <em>Murji’ah</em> did the opposite, they took hold of the texts of promise and they abandoned the texts where there is a threat. So, each of the two groups are <em>daal</em> (astray).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or unless he prays to other than Allaah or he sacrifices for other than Allaah,” </strong>such that he prays towards a grave seeking nearness to it or he makes prostration to an idol or he makes a sacrifice for other than Allaah and does anything from the acts of worship for other than Allaah then this person is a <em>mushrik</em> (a person of shirk), <em>a kaafir (</em>disbeliever) outside the religion and whatever is lesser than that then the people of the Sunnah are upon a middle position with regard to him in between the <em>Murji`ah</em> and the <em>Khawaarij</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does anything from that then it becomes binding upon you to expel him from Islaam,”</strong> if he does anything from that, meaning if he prays to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah or does an act of worship for other than Allaah then it is binding upon you to expel him from the religion and it is binding upon you to believe that he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> and you may not say this is not my concern or I don’t know about him. Rather, it is obligatory upon you to declare the disbeliever and the <em>mushrik</em> to be a disbeliever and that you declare the sinner to be a sinner, one who commits a major sin, which is less than shirk. So, the truth about this matter must be made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality,” </strong>meaning with regard to what is apparent with us and his hidden condition is left to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 31</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is permissible to fight the Khawaarij if they attack the property, persons or families of the Muslims; but if they desist and depart then it is not his right to chase them nor are their wounded to be killed nor may he seize their property as booty nor may he kill those of them taken captive nor may he chase those of them who flee.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369450953&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-permissible-to-fight-thekhawaarij-ifthey-attack-the-propertypersons-or-families-of-themuslims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have come to know that the Khawaarij are those who hold breaking away from obedience and they hold that there is no pledge of allegiance to the person in authority (the ruler) or that no bay`ah (pledge) remains if he commits sin; and they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins. So those people who accept this position but they do not have strength and they do not fight then they are left, along with their being advised and having the affair made clear to them so that perhaps they may return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for if they come to have strength and they manifest their force, then it becomes obligatory upon the Muslims to fight against them to repel their evil. And they are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers; rather they are fought against upon the basis that they are Muslims who have transgressed against the Muslims and attacked them. And for this reason when the Chief of the Believers (ameerulmu·mineen), `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> was questioned about the Khawaarij, “Are they disbelievers?” So he said, “No, they fled away from disbelief; but rather they are a people who transgressed against us.” [01],[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they (the Khawaarij) are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers, and therefore their women and their children are not taken as slaves and their property is not seized and those of them who are injured are not killed because the fighting against them is just to repel their evil, not because of their being disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is permissible to fight against the Khawaarij if they attack the Muslims with regard to their property, their persons and their families,”</strong> because the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded that they be fought against and because `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> fought against them when they attacked `Abdullaah ibn Khabbaab ibn al-Aratt <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And they killed him and they split open the abdomen of his slave girl who was pregnant. So then when they did that the Chief of the Believers (meaning `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>) resolved to fight them because the first signs of their evil had now appeared from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“But it is not for him (the Muslim ruler), if they desist and leave them alone, to chase them.”</strong> If they desist from fighting then it is not for the ruler to chase them and to wage war against them as long as they do not commit transgression. So they are astray without any doubt and it is obligatory to give them advice so that perhaps they will return; however they are not to be fought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he may not kill their injured,”</strong> because the wounded person, his evil has been curbed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not take their property as booty,”</strong> meaning their property is not taken as ghaneemah (booty/spoils of war) because it is the property of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not kill those of them taken prisoner,”</strong> because they are Muslims and their evil has been prevented by their having been taken captive and by their being wounded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and those of them who flee away are not to be chased.”</strong> If they are defeated, then the ruler leaves them alone and he does not chase after them because their evil has been repelled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by `Abdur-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf and al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You’ll find some narrations reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah also in his Musannaf, as indicated here also by al-Bayhaqiyy. And some of the reports contain the wording that `Aliyy radiyAllaahu `anh said something similar to this with regard to the People of the Camel, meaning the Companions who fought against him in the Battle of the Camel, and in some of the reports it mentions that he said something like this with regard to the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And as for this wording that Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned here, then it is indeed as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned it, he said it was with regard to the Khawaarij and it is an important difference with regard to the wording.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyya</strong>h <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in Risaalatu Fadli Ahlil-Bayt wa Huqooqihim (a treatise with regard to the virtue of the Ahlul-Bayt, the family of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and their rights) “It is established from ameerul-mu·mineen `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> through different chains that when he fought against the People of the Camel, he did not take their children as slaves and he did not take their wealth as booty and he did not kill their wounded ones and he did not chase after those who fled and he did not kill any captive and he prayed (the funeral prayer) over those who had been killed from both sides, at both the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffeen. And he said “Ikhwaanunaa baghow `alaynaa.”, “They are our brothers; they transgressed against us.” And he informed that they are not disbelievers nor are they hypocrites. And in what he said he was following the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, since he called them brothers and he declared them to be believers in the fighting and in the transgression just as is mentioned in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وَإِن طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا الَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن فَاءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said (two pages later),<span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"> “They are not equal those who were killed, who he prayed over and he called them ikhwaanunaa (our brothers), they are not equal along with those whom he did not pray over (the Khawaarij at the Battle of Nahrawaan).</span> </span>Rather, when it was said to him (quoting the aayah from Sooratul-Kahf (18), towards the end of the soorah), “Who are,</p>
<p>الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds! </span></strong>(18:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he replied, “They are the people of Harooraa· (meaning the Khawaarij).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> rahimahullaah mentioned, “And likewise, the people of Siffeen, he prayed the funeral prayer over those who were killed from them and he said, ‘They are our brothers, they transgressed against us but the sword purified them.’ And if in his view they had been disbelievers, he would not have prayed funeral prayer over them and he would not have declared them to be brothers and he would not have stated that the sword purified anything from them.” (Minhaajus-Sunnah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the Khawaarij the wording is as Shaykh al-Fowzaan put it here. What is authentic with regard to the Khawaarij that he said when they asked, “Are they disbelievers?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “No they fled from disbelief; they are a people who transgressed against us.” He didn’t call them his brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then he quoted the same quotes from Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever revolts against a ruler from the Muslim rulers, then he is a Khaarijiyy (one of the Khawaarij).”</strong> Whoever departs from obedience to the one in authority and rebels against his authority, using the excuse that the person in authority has sins and has acts contrary to the legislation, as is done by the Khawaarij; then he has the ruling of the Khawaarij. And the Khawaarij are a deviant group which first sprouted in the time of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> when Thul-Khuwaysirah came and said to the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, when he saw him dividing the booty, he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do justice O Muhammad, for you have not been just!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,<br />
“Woe to you! Then who will do justice if I do not do justice?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when that man departed he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There will emerge from the progeny of this one&#8230;”</strong></span> Meaning from his type <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“&#8230;a people; you will belittle your Prayers in comparison to their Prayers, and your worship in comparison to their worship. They will recite the Qur·aan but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots straight through the game. So wherever you find them then fight them, for in fighting them there is reward for those who fight them.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to fight against them and that is in order to stop their evil from the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the case if they come out with weapons and they bear arms, but as for their merely manifesting the view of the Khawaarij and speaking with it but not fighting and not bearing arms, then in that case we rebuke them and we make clear to them their misguidance but we do not fight against them. However, if they gain strength and they start to fight against the Muslims then it is not permissible then for the Muslims to leave them. Rather it is obligatory upon the person in authority to fight against them, and it is obligatory upon the Muslims that they should be along with the person in authority against them, just as occurred in the khilaafah (Caliphate) of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> when he fought against the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And the Companions joined him and they fought against the Khawaarij along with him until they killed them in the worst manner; and through that he attained the reward which Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> promised in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed there is reward in fighting against them for those who fight against them.”</span></strong> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from the virtues of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, and his virtues are many. And from them is that he fought against the Khawaarij and he implemented the statement of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> regarding them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he has caused dissent within the Muslims and he has contradicted the narrations and his death will be the death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Khawaarij, they are the people who broke the unity of obedience and they revolted against the person in authority. And likewise they are the ones who declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins, kabaa·ir, which are less than shirk. So therefore they have two signs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first sign</strong> is their khurooj (rebelling) against the person in authority over the Muslims and their attempting to remove the one in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second sign</strong> is that they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of kabaa·ir (major sins), which are less than shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what led them to this is ghuluww (extremism), and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And therefore, the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against ghuluww (extremism) saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware of ghuluww (extremism) for those who came before you were only destroyed on account of ghuluww (extremism/going beyond the limits.)”</span></strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is adding to the Religion and adding to that which is legislated with regard to criticising an evil. This is ghuluww (extremism) which led the Khawaarij to what occurred from them. They had ghuluww, went overboard, in criticising an evil to such an extent that they split apart from unity of obedience and they went beyond the limit, to extremes in worship to the extent that they declared those people who commit major sins from the Muslims to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;he has contradicted the narrations&#8230;”</strong> Meaning the ahaadeeth which occur from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to adhering to obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;and his death will be a death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning because he has a characteristic from the characteristic of the Times of Ignorance (times of jaahiliyyah) because the Arabs in the times of jaahiliyyah (the Times of Ignorance) used to be dispersed within different tribes; they had no single ruler who would unite them, rather, each tribe would be independent on its own and they would make surprise attacks upon other tribes. And they did not unite except after Allaah sent Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He called them to Islaam so they accepted Islaam and they came to be beneath a single banner. And therefore He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember the favour of Allaah upon you that you were previously enemies, so He joined between your hearts and through His favour you became brothers.</strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when you were few and you were weak upon the earth, fearing that the people would snatch you away, and Allaah gave you shelter and He strengthened you with His aid and He provided provision for you from the good and pure things so that you may give thanks.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fruits of obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims, all these good things come about through that: establishment of security, the ability to seek provisions and the people being able to travel far and wide to seek provisions on account of the roads being safe. But when there is a state of fear, then in that case the people do not travel, they do not buy and sell out of fear for themselves. So these are from the virtues of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body) and of obedience to the one in authority. As for revolting against the one in authority and splitting away from obedience then that brings about the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> It causes the splitting of the United Body of the Muslims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The shedding of blood without right</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> The enemy overcoming; because the enemy are happy at this. And therefore you will find the disbelievers being joyful at the splitting of the Muslims, and they bring about splits between the Muslims and they aid the deviant groups. They provide them with weapons and they aid them with planning so that they rebel against the United Body of the Muslims, and splitting occurs among the Muslims, so that they can seize them as plunder, as happens. So all of this is a result of disunity and of disobeying the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and of rebelling against the ones in authority over the affairs of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, one who has no ruler, then he is like a person who lives in jaahiliyyah (Times of Ignorance) and if he dies then his death is like that of the Times of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever, but rather it means that he has a characteristic from the characteristics of the Days of Ignorance in that he does not enter under obedience to a ruler; instead he lives in chaos, <em>fowdaa</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 11 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-the-most-high-is-an-innovation-misguidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Kalaam, speech/rhetorical theology/theological rhetoric, with regard to the Lord, the Most High, is something new and it is an innovation and misguidance.”</strong> Meaning, theological rhetoric, kalaam, with regard to the Self of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and with regard to His Names and His Attributes, is a newly introduced affair. It was introduced by the people of misguidance, those who do not submit to the texts and who do not have fear of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore they speak about the Self of the Lord, and they speak about His Names and His Attributes, and they deny and they negate that which Allaah affirmed for Himself or that which His Messenger affirmed for Him. And they bring opinions from themselves. (And they say) “This is what is correct.” They speak in explanation of the texts with other than their correct explanation, or they say, “We don’t understand them.” They say, “We leave and entrust them to Allaah.” And the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger becomes just like foreign/non-Arabic speech which the Arabs do not understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslims is that they continue upon the correct path, upon the way of the Salaf and that they do not give any attention to those people who mislead others, those who argue about Allaah without any proof which He has given them. They dispute about the Qur·aan and they dispute about the Sunnah. Their affair is just argumentation. So it is obligatory to beware of those people. Those people are not people who are followers (of the Truth); rather they are innovators who are just following their desires. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And nothing is to be said about the Lord except that which He described Himself with, He the Mighty and Majestic, in the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong> Having forbidden argumentation about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and arguments/debates about the Names of Allaah and His Attributes, he now explains what is obligatory. And it is that we affirm the Qur·aan and the Sunnah just as they came upon their meaning, the meaning taken from the Arabic language with which the Qur·aan and the Sunnah came down. So al `ilm, knowledge, its meaning is well known in the language. Likewise al-wajh, the face, is well known. And al-`ayn, eyes, and al-yad, hands, and al-istiwaa·, ascending, and al-`uloow, being high above, all of these and their like, their meaning is well known in the Arabic language in which the Qur·aan came down. Whereas the people of misguidance, they say “This speech is not in accordance with what is apparent from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then they divide into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• A category who say, “We stop and withhold. And we say what is apparent is not what is meant; but then we do not understand what is actually meant by it.” And they are the <strong>Mufowwidah</strong> the people of <strong>tafweed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And the second category are the <strong>Mu&#8217;owwillah</strong>, the people of <strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong>, who give false interpretations. And they are more in number; they are the majority out of these two groups. They interpret with other than their correct meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went astray and they lead others astray and they preoccupy the people. And they fill up books with these debates, with arguments and disputations which lead to nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is to submit to what occurs in the Book and in the Sunnah with regard to the Names of Allaah and His Attributes as was meant by Allaah and His Messenger, because Allaah knows best about Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and He knows best about other than Himself. And the most knowledgeable one from the creation about Allaah is the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. As for us, then our knowledge falls short. There are many things that we do not know related to our own selves with regard to the details of our bodies and the veins and the senses. There are things which we do not know. Do you know the rooh, about the soul? What exactly is it? The intellect, what is it? If you do not know something from your own body, nor something about your own self, then how can you speak about the Self of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, which is not known, except to Him, He, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge</strong></span> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is outside what they know and outside what they can imagine. And no analogy can be made between Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and His creation. This would be a belittlement of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So He knows best about His Self and about other than Himself. And He is the One who is truest in saying and better in speech than His creation, as Shaykhul-Islaam rahimahullaah said in al-Waasitiyyah [03].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and what Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions.”</strong> The issue of the Names and Attributes hinges upon the Book and the Sunnah. And their explanation is also in the Book and the Sunnah, and the language of the Arabs in which the Legislation came down. And we do not go to the logic of Aristotle and Plato, or so and so, or such and such. This is a crime against the Legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is a case of replacing the Revelation with logic and `ilmul-kalaam, theological rhetoric. And what fruit did theological rhetoric and argumentation produce for those people with regard to misguidance and ruin and loss. And they did not reach any result. And this is by their own admission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They expended their whole lives in debating and disputations, and in the end they acknowledged that they did not reached any result. And if only they had submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, they would have found relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore one of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“The result of using the intellects is just that the mind is tied in knots</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And most of the striving of the people is just misguidance</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And our spirits are forlorn strangers within our bodies</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And all the results that come about in this world for us are just harm and an evil climate</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we did not benefit from our studies through our whole lives except that we just gathered they said and such and such said (idle speech).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they came to a state of doubt and uncertainty. And as for those who submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger, then they were saved and at peace from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance say also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“Upon my life, I have gone around all of the institutions of learning</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I have looked upon all those places</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I did not see except one who is putting his palm</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> upon his chin in confusion or one who is striking his teeth in regret.”</em></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went around all the institutes of learning, institutes of theological rhetoric and logic and debating and he examined them and did not find in them that which could remedy the need to know. And he said [06]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have carefully considered the different paths of theological rhetoric and the ways of the philosophers. And I did not see them remedying the sick [07] nor quenching the thirst of the person with extreme thirst. And I saw that the closest path was the way of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read with regard to affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The good word ascends to Him.</strong></span> (Soorah Faatir (35), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended upon the Throne.</span></strong> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And read with regard to negation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they do not encompass Him with knowledge</span></strong>. (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 110) ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One. There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing.”</strong></span> He is, He the Perfect, One. No one shares with Him with regard to His Self nor with regard to His Names and His Attributes nor with regard to His Creating and His Actions nor with regard to His worship. There is no sharer and no partner for Him. So why therefore tire yourself out? You are a created being and He is the Creator. How can the created being encompass knowledge of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High? So you, your role is just to submit to Allaah and to His Messenger and not to dispute and not to argue and not to tire yourself out and to tire other people out. This is what is obligatory and binding. And therefore the Companions, they did not engage themselves in these unnecessary matters. And they did not withhold with regard to an aayah or with regard to a hadeeth. Rather they affirmed it and submitted to it and held what it contained as their creed and belief, and they never had any problems arise, ever. So the matter is a matter requiring submission and compliance. And that we do not delve into matters of creed and belief in the way which the people of disputation and the people of kalaam, theological rhetoric, and people of logic delved into it. Such that the result was, as they themselves admitted regarding themselves, that they ended up in a state of bewilderment and confusion and not reaching any result, as one of them said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We didn’t benefit anything from our studies, throughout our whole lives Except in the end we just gathered idle speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Meaning), so and so said and so and so said. And if he says such and such then the response is such and such. [08]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “Meaning by that, speech which was introduced by the Jahmiyyah with regard to delving into speaking about Attributes of Allaah without knowledge. But as for describing (giving as an Attribute) that which Allaah described Himself with or which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, then this is something required.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] This is a quote from ar-Raazee quoted from him in the book an-Nuboowaat of Shaykhul-Islaam (ibn Taymeeyah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s note:</strong> curing the one who has a need for knowledge</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Shaykh as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said, “Then he made clear that it is obligatory to describe Allaah with that which He described Himself with, and that which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, without tahreef, distorting the meaning, without ta`teel, denying/depriving it of meaning, without takyeef, saying how, and without tamtheel, likening the Creator to the creation, in accordance with His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him (Allaah); and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “There is nothing like Him;” this is negation. And, “and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing;” this is affirmation. And it contains a proof for detailed affirmation and for general and concise negation. Because His Saying, “There is nothing like Him,” this is a general and concise and negation. It negates everything that can be imagined or can cross the mind. And “and He is The Hearing, The Seeing,” this is affirmation in detail. And this aayah is a tremendous principle with regard to affirming the Attributes along with declaring Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, free of whatever does not befit Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 10</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart, even if the person happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363815261&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters, al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), debating and disputing which occurred between all of the sects, these are newly introduced matters. And the reason for them is the following of desires. And whoever is such that his desires follow that which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came with, then he will not have doubt.; and he will not be a person of disputing nor arguing nor quarrelling, because he is one who submits and complies. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if Guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance, then there will be no fear upon them and they will not grieve.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever follows My Guidance, then he will not go astray and he will not be wretched.</strong></span> (Soorah Taa Haa (20), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is a question of following, <em><strong>ittibaa</strong></em>`, and complying, <em><strong>inqiyaad</strong></em>, and submitting, <em><strong>tasleem</strong></em>, to the command of Allaah and His Messenger without debating and without argumentation. And the people of misguidance did not fall into argumentation and debates except on account of the fact that they did not submit to Allaah and to His Messenger in the way that the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah submitted. And therefore you will find the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and all Praise is for Allaah, united with no difference between them in the matter of `aqeedah, creed and belief; rather disagreement is found with the misguided sects. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they turn away then they are the ones who will have split away and opposed. So Allaah will suffice you against them. And He is the all Hearing the all Knowing.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 137)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the confirmation of this occurs in another aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow the other paths for they will cause you to split away and separate from His path. This He has commanded you with so that you may be dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-An `aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“(Theological rhetoric, arguing, debating, disputing are all newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart)</strong> <strong>even if the person involved in them happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah</strong>.” Meaning, he will still be in error, because he has attained these two (the Truth and Sunnah) through other than the correct path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the correct path is submission and not delving and debating and arguing which just causes the hearts to become bitter and produces grudges. And it also brings about something worse than that which is at-takfeer, people declaring others to be disbelievers, because the misguided sects they declare each other to be disbelievers and they declare each other to be misguided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every sect rejoicing at what they themselves are upon.</strong> </span>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone thinking that what he is upon is what is correct. As for the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the people of Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth, who submitted to the command and complied, then disagreements did not occur between them, and all Praise is for Allaah. And they do not declare each other to be disbelievers, and they do not declare each other to be misguided; rather they praise each other. And some of them follow others, because they are upon a correct path. Indeed hatred and grudges and declarations of others being disbelievers and being misguided only comes about on account of contradicting the Truth and taking hold of opinions and ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that everyone wants to defend his own opinion. So he will not accept that it will be said to him, “You are wrong,” for this will mean that you are accusing his intellect of being deficient and he will not be pleased with this. However, if you say to a person of Truth when he has made a mistake, “You have erred with regard to the evidence in this matter, you have missed out on the Sunnah,” then he will accept it, because his intent is the Truth and his intent is not just to support his own opinion. So if you say, “O so and so, you have missed out on the Sunnah, you have missed out on the correct evidence,” then he will accept and return. But if you say to a person who is a follower of desires, “You are in error,” then he will become angry and become worse. And this is the sign of the people of desires, that everyone just wants to aid and support that which he desires. But as for the person of the Truth, then what he wants is that the Truth should be aided, and he seeks after the Truth. And the wise word is the lost property of the believer; wherever he finds it, he takes hold of it. [01]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 06 : Point 04A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[ <strong>Note</strong>: In this audio, explanation of the only first paragraph from the above is covered]</em></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-religion-is-only-what-came-from-allaah-it-was-not-left-to-the-intellectsopinions-of-men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion came only from Allaah, so He is the One who legislated the Religion, He the Perfect. It is not for anyone to legislate religion, which Allaah has not permitted. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they have partners who legislate for them religion, not ordained by Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a rebuke and a warning. So the Religion is that which Allaah has legislated, and which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam conveyed. This is the Religion about which Allaah the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) legislated for you the Religion with which He enjoined Nooh, and which He revealed to you, and which He enjoined upon Ibraaheem, and Moosaa and `Eesaa; that you should establish the Religion, and not separate within it.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the revealed way of the Prophets, specifically those five Prophets, who are those firmest in resolve. This is their Religion. So whoever deviates away from it or differs with it, then he is destroyed and he is astray. And it is built upon the tawheed of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic (singling out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with all worship) and abandonment of the worship of everything besides Him, and restricting oneself to that which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic legislated, and keeping away from whatever Allaah has forbidden &#8211; this is the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It was not left up to the intellects of men and their opinions.”</strong> &#8211; the Religion is not what men deem to be good or what they hold as their opinion, because this is not the Religion of Allaah. This is the Religion of the people, which they have newly invented. As for the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then it is what He legislated. As for that which the men hold as their opinion, based upon their own opinions, this is not the Religion of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Rather it is just a religion of whoever holds that opinion. So nothing can be ascribed to Allaah from the Religion except that which He legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And as for what others besides Him legislated, then it cannot be ascribed to Allaah, rather it can only be ascribed to whoever legislated it, and Allaah is free of it. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they have partners who legislate for them religion which Allaah has not permitted</strong></span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And its knowledge is with Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</strong> &#8211; the affairs of the Religion are <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>towqeefiyyah</em> </span>(depend upon text); there must be proofs from Allaah and His Messenger with regard to the affairs of the Religion. The matter is restricted to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from the affairs of the Religion. And newly introduced matters and innovations are abandoned, that which Allaah has not sent down any proof for &#8211; even if their people hold them to be religion, and they draw closer to Allaah through them, then we turn no attention to these things and we do not believe in them, because the Religion of Allaah is what He legislated and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Religion is based upon knowledge which came from Allaah and His Messenger. And do not follow the desires of the people and the opinions of the people and what they declare to be good and what they follow each other upon, and it has no basis in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected”</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who wishes that his action be righteous and be beneficial, then he should adhere to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first matter:</strong> is that he makes his Religion pure for Allaah and free from shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second matter:</strong> ittibaa`, following the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, free of innovations and newly introduced affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person will indeed find many things which contradict what is correct in the `aqeedah, matters which contradict what is correct in matters of worship, many of them; (because) the people have desires, and have their own aspirations, and they have their own opinions and they have their own ways (which they follow). So we do not follow the people, rather we present whatever the people are upon to the Book and the Sunnah. So whatever conforms with the Book and the Sunnah then it is the Truth, and whatever contradicts these two then it is false and futile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 1304</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner would like to be given a general idea about the Qadiriyyah Tariqah (Sufi order). He read one of the Qadiriyyah books: <em>&#8220;Al-Fiyudat Al-Rabbaniyyah fi Al-Ma&#8217;athir wa Al-Awrad Al-Qadiriyyah&#8221;</em>, and saw a poem including some of the claims and feats performed by the shaykh of this Tariqah. He asks if what is said in this poem is true or untrue. The questioner sent the poem along with his question to ask for a general Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The poem that was sent by the questioner shows that the one who wrote it was ignorant, as the things that he ascribes to himself are Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. He claims that all the scholars&#8217; knowledge has been derived from his knowledge and is part of him. He also claims that the Servants&#8217; behavior is according to what he legislates for them and that he would be able to close the Fire due to his greatness, except for a prior pledge taken from the Prophet. He says he can help those of his Murid (students) who are loyal to him and save them from ordeals, protect them in this world and in the Hereafter, secure them from fear, and be with them at the Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are false claims, and could only be said by someone who is ignorant and does not know his own ability. Comprehensive knowledge is possessed by Allah Alone, as are the matters related to the Hereafter, and He Alone has control over them; not an angel, a prophet, or a pious person. Allah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His Creation, to recite to the Ummah (nation) His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8220;It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;None can protect me from Allâh’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) told those closest to him to save themselves and their children from Allah&#8217;s Punishment through having Iman (Faith) in Him (Glorified be He) and by acting according to His Shari`ah (laws). He also told them that Allah is not in need of them and that Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham) and `Isa (Jesus) will be saying on the Day of Resurrection, &#8220;Myself, myself!&#8221; So how can a shaykh of the Qadiriyyah Tariqah or anyone else created by Allah save their followers, protect those who are loyal to them, and come with them when their deeds are being weighed on the Day of Resurrection? And how could he close the gates of Hell by his greatness? <strong>This is a manifest fabrication and clear Kufr regarding the Shari`ah of the Lord of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of this poem has been excessive in his exaggeration and has overstepped the boundaries of the senses,the intellect, and the Shari`ah, when he claims that he was in the light of Muhammad before the existence of creation, and that he witnessed the meeting of friends, i.e. when Jibril (Gabriel) met with Muhammad (peace be upon them both); he was with Nuh (peace be upon him) in the ark and witnessed the flood; he was with Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he was thrown to the fire and saw how the fire cooled due to his Du`a&#8217; (supplication); he was with Isma`il (Ishmael) and that the ram was only sent except by his generosity; he was with Ya`qub (Jacob, peace be upon him) when his sight was taken away and that his eyes were only cured with his spit; he was the one who settled Idris (Enoch, peace be upon him) in Jannah (Paradise); he was with Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) when he talked to his Lord and that Musa&#8217;s stick was taken from his stick; he was with `Isa (peace be upon him) in the cradle; and that it was he who gave Dawud (David) his beautiful voice for recitation. He also makes even more obscene claims than these, as he claims that he is Allah in three verses of his poem, the clearest of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am the one, the only, and the great one in himself,<br />
I am the describer and the described; the shaykh of the Tariqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah be Exalted and Glorified from this great exceeding of the bounds; <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">is there anything worse than this sheer Kufr?</span> </strong>May Allah protect us from it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Dear questioner, may Allah turn you away from this evil you heard and make you feel no need to study the detailed history and biography of the Qadiriyyah, and what is in this poem by the shaykh of this Tariqah in terms of falsehood, Kufr, and exaggeration. Exert yourself instead to learn the truth from the Book of Allah(Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and the explanations of the Salaf (pious predecessors) from among the Sahabah (Companions) and their followers of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah. We believe that <strong>Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany</strong>, to whom this Tariqah is ascribed, is as innocent of what is in this poem as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Yaqub&#8217;s son. His followers tell many lies about him and ascribe to him that which he is innocent of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Five principles of the Mu’tazilah, the deviant group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1) Tawheed (literally Divine Unity)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say that this means: denying the Attributes of Allaah. And the Mu’tazilah hold that the person who affirms the Attributes of Allaah is a person of shirk. They believe that affirming many Attributes for Allaah would necessitate affirming many different gods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2) Adl (literally &#8216;justice&#8217;)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They misinterpret this to mean: denying Qadr (the Pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say that affirming the Pre-decree – that Allaah has knowledge of and has already written down everything which is to happen &#8211; is tyranny and oppression upon His Servants and it is obligatory upon Allaah to be just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3) Enjoining the good and forbidding the evil</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What these misguided people intend by this is: rebelling against the Muslim rulers who have fallen into sins less than shirk. And this idea of rebellion is evil itself, and is not from good whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4) The status in this world of the person who commits a major sin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth principle is that of: al manzil baynal manzilatayn – the station between the two stations. This refers to their mistaken judgement upon the major sinner that he/she has justify Islaam, but whilst still in this life, the person has not actually entered kufr (disbelief). So the person is on a station between the two stations of kufr and eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In comparison, the Khawaarij pass the judgement of kufr upon such a person in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5) The fate in the hereafter of the major sinner</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth principle is: infaadh ul wa’eed (enforcing the textual threats). This refers to their belief that whoever dies upon a major sin less than shirk will remain in the Hellfire forever. And in this aspect of ‘aqeedah, they are in agreement with the Khawaarij who also say that the major sinner will be in the Hellfire forever in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these are the five fundamental principles of the Mu’tazilah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from Appendix I of  the book : “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah – that is the way of wisdom and intelligence” – by Shaykh Rabee hafidhahullaah, translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Appendix I </strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah alone, and may He send praises and blessings of peace upon the Messenger of Allaah, and upon his family and true followers, and his Companions and those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I praise Allaah, with abundant, pure and blessed praise for every blessing which He has bestowed on me, and I give thanks to Him, the Most High, and praise and extol Him, and I cannot praise and extol Him as truly befits Him, and no-one can do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then from the blessings which Allaah has bestowed on me is that He has enabled me, despite my weakness, to speak the truth openly according to my capability, whether in writing or face to face encounters, so I thank Him and praise Him with praise such as would fill the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. I also ask that He grants me firmness upon that until I meet Him and that He is pleased with me. I further ask that He grants me increase in guidance to what is correct, and protection, and I do not forget, and all praise is for Allaah, that when my book, ‘The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah &#8211; That is the Way of Wisdom and Intellect,’ was published it was accepted by the true Muslim youth in every place with joy and was greatly welcomed. This was because it made the call of the Prophets clear to them, until it became as clear as the sun in the middle of the day, and it removed confusion, distortions and the deception of some writers whose hearts were like those of devils in the form of humans those whose only concern is to gather the people around them and around their fraudulent slogans. It does not worry such people that this gathering of people should include the Raafidees (extreme <em>Shee’ah</em>), the hypocrites, the heretical <em>Khawaarij</em>,[2] the extreme Sufis who are guilty of apostasy, the ignorant and their like from the worshippers of the graves, or whichever of the wretched and unfortunate groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not worry them that this type of people rally together with them and rally to their slogans, despite the evil consequences of this in this world and the Hereafter. This is because they are as they were described by Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Callers to the gates of Hell, whoever answers their call will be thrown into it,”</em> and because they are as the sincere, truthful and trustworthy Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   described them, <em>“Devils in the bodies of humans.”</em> If this is not the case then what is it that causes them, and those who follow their lead, to flee from and separate themselves from the clear and radiant way and methodology of the Prophets, which is made clear by the Qur&#8217;aan and shown to be their way and their methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to this His names and attributes, <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His lordship, and <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His worship, and to disbelieve and reject everything that is worshipped besides Him &#8211; that is the pure religion. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah &#8211; so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Study any of the other <em>da’wah</em>s of the sects and parties &#8211; other than the <em>Salafee</em>[5] <em>da’wah </em>&#8211; do you see this methodology or any trace of it in their schooling, their persons, or their <em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>? Then show it to me if you are truthful. As for myself I do not find in these sects and parties except that they wage a fierce war against this methodology and its people. I do not see except belittlement and mockery of this methodology and its people. I do not see except hatred and enmity for this methodology and its people, and I do not see except warm greetings and respect from them for the deviant and misguided calls and their people. Indeed you will frequently see and hear the last of these from those who disguise themselves as <em>Salafees</em> but are in reality closer in relation to their enemies, and there are ties and relationships between them which are such as they are known only to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are some who are passionately in love with the state of superstitions, innovations and misguidance who think- and evil are their thoughts, and evil is the lie which they invent- that Imake a separation between the religion and the State, and that I dispute about the importance of the subject of authority of sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What a serious word it is that comes out of their mouths! What they say is nothing but a lie”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this book displeased them and it made clear the falsity of their calls and their misrepresentation and distortion of Islaam and of the text concerning <em>tawheed </em>&#8211; particularly with regard to the <em>da’wah</em> of the Messengers, may Allaah’s praise and blessings of peace be upon them. The book did not join them in welcoming the state of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ahs</em>. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets founded upon the building of the tombs and upon the belief that the pious who have died know the Hidden and Unseen and have some control over the creation. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets based upon any such things as have preceded, nor in accepting the misguidance and <em>shirk</em> of secularism which seeks to disguise itself in the guise of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the book, and all praise is for Allaah, made clear that the true and trustworthy <em>da’wah</em> is that which follows the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah, and the state which is established upon this correct methodology &#8211; that is the Islamic state. Then despite the fact that the book was dealing with a particular topic &#8211; which was to explain the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah &#8211; it still gave attention to mentioning the Islamic state which it mentioned repeatedly and emphasised a number of times. It even had a chapter headed: &#8220;The view of the scholars of Islaam concerning leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) and their proofs of its obligation&#8221;. Then the scholars sayings about that were quoted and their proofs mentioned. However what angered the people of innovations and desires, and the callers to falsehood, is that I placed leadership and the state in the place given to them by Allaah and which was accepted by the scholars of Islaam. I did not support the people of innovation and desires in their abandonment of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to <em>tawheed</em>, and fighting <em>shirk</em>, innovations and the rest of the types of misguidance and deviation, and fighting idolatry and grave-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor did I support them in making leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) the most important matter, and the most fundamental principle &#8211; which is something which has led people to rejection of the methodology of the Prophets and has lead them to fight against it. It has also led them to fling themselves into the arms of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>, and to having affection for them, and to allying themselves with them, defending them and to falsley adorning their ideology which is at war with Islaam, in opposition to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and waging war against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   and his pure wives and the rest of the Muslims and their scholars. Indeed it goes beyond that to the point that they declare these great people to be disbelievers and make the foulest attacks against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not support them in this misguidance and this loathsome excess, so they disliked the book and thought evil about its author. So they said the falsehood which they said in order to turn the youth who thirst for the truth away from the irrefutable and clear truth in this book. This book which openly spoke the truth and placed both correct creed and belief (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and the state in the place given to them by Allaah &#8211; without going beyond the bounds or falling short, and without distorting and deception. Then it is essential that I explain to the youth the distinction between the state (<em>ad-Dawlah</em>) and the dominion and sovereignty of Allaah (<em>al-Haakimiyyah</em>). As for the state, then it is a gathering of people who may be disbelievers, may be misguided deviants, or may be Believers. Then the people may be gathered under a rightly- guided <em>khilaafah</em>, or restricted kingships- which has been the case with the Islamic states after the rightly -guided <em>khilaafah</em>. So these individuals who form the Believing state are no more than the means to implement the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah- the establishment of <em>jihaad</em>, the ordering of good and forbidding of evil, establishment of the Prescribed Punishments and retribution, and the protection of the <em>ummah</em> from the plots and aggression of the enemies against the lands of the Muslims and against their souls, their wealth and their honour. So the Muslims must establish a state to accomplish these great obligations &#8211; either : by giving the pledge of allegiance to a <em>khaleefah</em> whom all of the Muslims are united upon; or by the fact that an individual from the <em>ummah</em> gains ascendancy and has power, an army and authority &#8211; which means that the benefit of the <em>ummah</em> lies in accepting him as long as he proclaims Islaam, establishes the laws and the creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and protects the <em>ummah</em> from its enemies and does whatever is required, the details of which are known and mentioned in the source works of Islaam; or by the fact that some individuals gain ascendancy over some areas as happened in the lands of Islaam after the weakening of the <em>khilaafah</em>, so overall benefit necessitated submitting to this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for dominion and sovereignty then these are attributes of Allaah and qualities particular to Him alone, as He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Judgement and command is for Allaah alone, He ordered that you should worship none but Him. That is the true and straight religion.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this authority and sovereignty is not denied except by one who is a disbeliever in Allaah and is severe in his enmity to Allaah, His Messenger and His Books. Indeed one who even denies Allaah’s authority in the slightest matter, not to mention with regard to fundamental matters, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of Islaam if he knowingly denies that. As for the ignorant person, then he has excuse until the proof is established against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have said applies to the rulers, the ruled and to indivduals and groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>). This has been affirmed by the trustworthy scholars of Islaam, and from them Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah,</em>[8] and his student Ibnul-Qayyim.[9] So whoever accepts and abides by this rule and authority in the fundamentals of the religion and its details, and in matters of creed and belief, and matters of worship, and dealings and political affairs, and economic affairs, and manners, and social affairs &#8211; then he is a Believer. But he who does not abide by it all or some of these then he is a disbeliever, whether he is an individual or a group, a ruler or one ruled, a caller or one called. Indeed I fear, by Allaah, for many of the sects, parties and individuals that they may fall into disbelief due to their not abiding by the rule and authority of Allaah with regard to the fundamentals of the religion, indeed with regard also to its details. I fear for many of them, against whom the proof has been established and to whom the truth has been made clear, yet still they persist in opposing the call to <em>tawheed</em> and oppose waging war against shirk and innovation, aswell as opposing its people and to cutting from them. Instead these people incite others against and warn against those who call with the call of the Prophets, and those who seek truly and sincerely to amend the affairs. After establishment of the proof against such a person he would fall into the abyss of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I call all of the <em>ummah</em> &#8211; its rulers and its ruled, its indivduals, sects, and parties, to all have true belief in the all-encompassing authority and sovereignty of Allaah which covers the fundamental matters of the religion and its details, and that they should fully abide by it with regard to the fundamental matters of the religion and its details. I also call the heads of the states, from those who abide generally by the rule and authority of Allaah, and yet are negligent in some areas of practice, I call them to abide by it totally and unrestrictedly in every field, in the matter of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and worship, and dealings, and economics, and politics, and with regard to ordering good and forbidding evil, and that they should strive to fight against <em>shirk</em> and innovations, and against sins and against evil &#8211; particularly usury and the rest of the major sins which harm the <em>ummah</em> and its manners. Indeed Allaah prevents by means of the rulers those who are not prevented by the Qur’aan. They should be fully aware that Allaah will question them about every small and large matter which they are responsible for. <em>“Each of you is a guardian and is responsible for thoses whom he is in charge of.” </em>I also remind them of the saying of the Prophet, <em>“There is no ruler having authority over Muslim subjects who dies while he is decieving them except that Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him.”</em>[10] and his saying, <em>“There is no servant whom Allaah places in authority over some people, and he does not deal with them sincerely and honestly, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.”</em>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From sincerity to the <em>ummah</em> is that you encourage them to abide by the ruler of Allaah and His <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, by teaching them, directing them, encouraging and warning them, and by ordering the good and forbidding the evil, and by establishing prescribed punishment and using every means which will cause them to respect the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in <em>‘aqeedah</em>, worship, political affairs and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also call the heads of state in Islamic lands who do not abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah that they should turn back to Allaah and respect His religion which is found in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and that they should cling to the creed and beliefs of this religion and its rulings, and to be proud of that &#8211; since therein lies honour and nobility. However total disgrace and humiliation comes from submission to laws laid down by the most despicable humans, the enemies of this <em>ummah</em> whether they are Jews, Christians, Magians or atheists. So I call such leaders to respect the feelings of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam which has striven and fought and sacrificed millions of its sons for the achievement of a noble and lofty goal &#8211; which is that it should be ruled by Islaam, and Islaam alone is the religion of Allaah, the Creator of this creation, the Creator of mankind and <em>jinn</em> so that they should worship Him alone and submit to His revealed laws alone. They should abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and impose it upon the <em>ummah</em> in creed and beliefs, in manners, in teaching and in Islamic curriculae which education and training are to be based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also enjoin the scholars of the <em>ummah</em>, and its callers, and parties and groups that they should sincerely advise all of the <em>ummah</em>, its elders and its youth, its males and its females, and unite them upon the Book of Allaah, the <em>Sunnah</em> of his Messenger, and upon the methodology and understanding of the <em>Salalafu-Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the Companions, the <em>Taabieen</em> and those who followed them upon good, the <em>imaams</em> of guidance, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em>, the scholars of <em>hadeeth</em> and of <em>tafseer</em>, in creed and beliefs, in worship, in manners, in dealings, in economic affairs, and all the other affairs of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>. Then they should fully comprehend the Sayings of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the transgressors.”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the disobedient.”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should understand that these Sayings of Allaah apply to all individuals, groups, rulers and subjects. So to restrict it to refer it to the rulers alone and not to the people of deviant sects and misguidance, those who do not judge by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in their creed and beliefs, nor in their worship and their behaviour, then this is from ignorance, misguidance and foolishness, since Allaah sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning the Jews at a time when they had not had any state or authority for centuries. He sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning them at a time when He had imposed humiliation and lowliness upon them. I have explained the authority and sovereignty of Allaah in this broad and all-embracing sense in the book itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I should also not fail to draw attention to an error made by the author of <em>‘Meezaanul-I&#8217;tidaal litaqyeem Kitaabil-Mawridiz-Zallaal fir-Tanbeeh &#8216;alaa Akhtaa’iz Zilaal,’ </em>who is ’Isaam ibn Muhammad ibn Taahir al-Barqaawee, who attributed to me something which my tongue has never uttered and which I never believed, nor have I ever written such a thing. Furthermore I seek Allaah’s refuge from what he said, and I declare myself free before Allaah from it, and I ask Allaah to save me and all the Muslims from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee said in a footnote (p.15) to his aforementioned book: “This also reminds me of what Shaykh Rabee&#8217; ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee, <em>hafizahullaahu ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, did in his book, <em>‘Manhajul-Anbiyaa fid-Da’wah illallaah&#8230;’ </em>when he criticised the view of al-Maududi, <em>rahimahullaah ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, about the importance of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), <em>khilaafah</em>, and judging by that which Allaah sent down, since he also sought to use as evidence the saying of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah about the position of the <em>imaamah</em> with the Raafidee (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). So he took up six pages in quoting the discussion of Shaykhul-Islaam with those <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). However the numerous and great differences between the beliefs of the <em>Raafidees</em> concerning the <em>imaamah</em> and the infallibility of the <em>Imaams</em>, and the twelve <em>imaams</em> and so on, and between what al-Maududi and others call to, i.e. the necessity and importance of striving to return to judging by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, through the <em>khilaafah</em>, and to establish a single ruler for the people of Islaam; the differences between these two are well known. Even if the words of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah contain something which is fitting in this regard, yet most of it, if a just person were to examine it, is not fitting to this discussion, rather it applies to the matter of <em>imaamah</em> with the <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>) with its well known details&#8230; so he should not have quoted it all&#8230; for fear of deception.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee&#8217;s scales are unbalanced and he has not judged between myself and al-Maududi with justice, and perhaps he has forgotten the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And weigh justly with the true balance.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Woe to those who give short measure to others. Those who demand full measure from others, but when they give them in measure or weight then they give them less than their due. Do these people not think that they will be ressurected for reckoning on a formidable Day. The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother al-Barqaawee, I was debating the view of al-Maududi about the importance of the matter of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), the <em>khilaafah</em> and judging by that which Allaah has sent down!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the fact of their importance, then no Believer having a trace of <em>eemaan</em> would dispute that. But O brother you have failed to note the point of disagreement between myself and al-Maududi. I debated with the view of al-Maududi with regard to his going beyond the due limits about leadership to such an extent that no Muslim who has respect for Islaam could remain silent about this excess, and it was of such a level that even the misguided would not accept it, not to mention the people of <em>hadeeth</em> and the <em>Salafees</em>. Indeed very many scholars from his own land, from the <em>Salafees</em> and others have replied to him. Then this excess of his has travelled and has reached many Arab and Islamic lands, and it has fooled an overwhelming majority of authors and youth, which has led to great neglect of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and even comtempt of it and of its people. It has also led people to treat <em>shirk</em> and innovation lightly and has caused al-Maududi and his like to ally themsleves with and to befriend the devotees of the graves and even the <em>Raafidees</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>), and to gather these people under their banner, to treat them as brothers, to love and defend them and their beliefs and creed, and this is something which is a reality and is clear to everyone possessing intellect and religion. So since the matter has reached this frightful state, I replied to al-Maududi with regard to some of his excess in order to make the people in general aware, and also the people of the Arabian Peninsula, to which the followers of al-Maududi and their helpers direct their attention. So they seek to wipe away the <em>’aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and the <em>’aqeedah</em> of true and correct alliance and enmity (<em>al-Walaa wal-Baraa</em>). Do you think that my reply to al-Maududi was so unreasonable that you seek to defend his view with falsehood, and by forgetting to judge justly, to the point that you take my words to mean something which I did not say, and which they did not mean?! Listen to what al-Maududi says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The question of leadership is the most important matter in human life and its most fundamental principle.” Then try to defend this saying with clear and unequivocal texts from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and the words of the Companions and the scholars of Islaam. If you have not seen this, then you must adjust your scales in order to establish justice, equity and fairness, and to abandon the excess which has led al-Maududi and his followers to scorn the call of the Prophets and the goal of their <em>da’wah</em>, and to turn the affairs upside down. Listen to his saying: “The true goal of the religion is to establish the system of the rightly guided and righteous leadership (<em>imaamah</em>).” So to him this is the true goal of the religion. So <em>tawheed</em>, and the Prayer, and<em> Zakaat</em>, and <em>jihaad</em> and other matters from the religion become only means to reach this goal in the view of al-Maududi. So produce the clear proofs from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , in place of al-Maududi, to support this and if you are unable then do not be too embarrassed to say, ‘This poor weak servant, Rabee’ ibn Haadee, has spoken the truth and has been sincere towards Islaam and the Muslims, and has put matters in their due place.’ Then listen to the saying of al-Maududi: “This is the purpose for which the Prayer, Fasting, the <em>Zakaat</em> and the <em>Hajj</em> have been made obligatory in Islaam. Then the fact that they are called acts of worship does not mean that they are themselves worship, rather its meaning is that they prepare mankind for the true and fundamental worship, and these are a training course which are essential for that.&#8217; He also says, &#8216;You think that standing facing the <em>Qiblah</em>, placing the right hand upon the justify, and <em>rukoo&#8217;</em> with your hands upon your knees, and prostration upon the ground, and reciting particular words, and these actions and movements are themselves worship; and you think that fasting from the start of <em>Ramadaan</em> until the start of <em>Shawwaal</em>, and going hungry and thirsty from morning until evening, you think that this is worship; and you think that reciting a number of <em>Aayaat</em> from the Qur&#8217;aan is worship; and you think that performing <em>Tawaaf</em> around the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> is worship. In summary you have called the manifestation of certain actions worship, and when a person performs these actions with their form and manners you think that he has worshipped Allaah&#8230; but the truth is that the worship which Allaah created you for, and which he ordered you to perform is something else.”[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you pleased by this derisive manner about speaking about the great pillars of Islaam and those who worship in this way? These are not, in the view of al-Maududi, forms of worship for which man was created, rather the worship for which man was created and which they were ordered to fulfil is something else. O Barqaawee, do you take this as your religion before Allaah? That the forms of worship are only a training course which if applied will&#8230; etc. Is this something stated textually in the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and which the Prophets came with and which was accepted by the best of the people of this <em>ummah</em>? If you agree with al-Maududi then bring the proofs to support his saying. Otherwise bite upon your knuckles in regret and grief for having deserted the truth and offended its people and helped falsehood. This, O my brother, was the subject of my debate with al-Maududi, and about which I quoted the words of Shaykhul-Islaam concerning the exceeding of the bounds by the <em>Raafidees</em> about leadership (imaamate). What I quoted from him was all relevant, not just a part of it as al-Barqaawee claimed. Then if you were correct, O Barqaawee, then why did you not explain what was relevant from the words of Shaykhul-Islaam and what was not? As for the claim of &#8216;infallibility&#8217; for the &#8216;twelve imaams,&#8217; then I did not attribute it to al-Maududi, nor did I debate about it with him, nor did I quote Shaykhul-Islaam’s words about it. So your words are totaly opposed to justice! As for your equity and justice which you set up for yourself in judging between Sayyid Qutb and ad-Duwaysh, then I do not know what you have done. Indeed you have totally failed to be just between myself and al-Maududi, and how would it have harmed you to speak the truth? Then as for the <em>khilaafah</em>, I do not know if you read what I wrote and quoted from the scholars of Islaam, or if you merely took the subject with the tips of your fingers with your eyes closed, thinking that justice and equity would be achieved that easily. So read this and that anew and speak the truth, supporting it with proof, not alarmism and agitation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for judging by that which Allaah sent down, then how can you imagine that I would dispute about it with al-Maududi or anyone else, when it is something known necessarily in the religion, and not even the deviant and deviated sects dispute about it?! So I seek Allaah’s refuge from what the author of <em>‘al-Meezaan,’</em> attributed to me. Rather read again what I wrote concerning the authority and sovereignty of Allaah, and that it comprehends every part of the religion, and you will see the extent of the mistake of al-Barqaawee, may Allah guide him. Then finally the points of criticism of al-Maududi and his like are so many that this introduction is not the place for them. But in summary, he is one of those furthest from abiding by the authority and sovereignty of Allaah with regard to his <em>’aqeedah</em> and his <em>Fiqh</em>, and with regard to his stance on the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and his stance with regard to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and with regard to their enemies the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>. Indeed he and his followers have alliance and friendship with those <em>Raafidees</em>, they support them and they praise their <em>Taaghoot</em>, al-Khomeini and his students, the <em>Aayatur-Raafidiyyah</em>. So noble reader be aware of this, and judge the people according to the truth, and do not judge the truth according to its people, and beware of falling into the abyss of over-exaggerated respect for personalities so that it leads you to reject the truth, and to argue against its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah guide and grant the <em>ummah</em> to loving the truth and its people. Indeed my Lord hears and responds to supplications.</p>

<span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> narrate from some of the righteous people that they said: ‘That people worship Allaah, and as for the<em>Soofeeyah</em> then they worship their own selves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Swallat Ibn al-Qayyim li Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah’ P.269 &amp; ‘Madarij Salikeen’ 1/260]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how good is what Abu Ahmad ash-Shayrazi said: ‘The <em>Soofeeyah</em> used to ridicule Shaytaan and now the Shaytaan ridicules them! !’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.241]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>The Deception of the Shaytaan of the Soofeeyah</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>comments on the statement of<em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> when he spoke about the deception of the Shaytaan of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, when he <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaytaan caused them to buzz around (dance) and to beat/strike the ground whizzing around on their feet, then sometimes he makes them like donkeys going around a pivot, and sometimes like insects dancing  in the middle of the house…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh (Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah</em>) intends the <em>Mutasawwafa</em> (<em>Soofeeyah</em>) who form into circles, then stand up in those circles and dance and swing from side to side to the tune of singing and musical instruments.  They shout, scream and dance together with what they call <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.409]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that Whistling and Clapping is Prayer</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> speaks about the <em>Ayaah</em> &lt;&lt; Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.  Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee commented on this by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the <em>Soofeeyah</em> of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is far from this.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.440]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>The Soofeeyah’s Dislike of Knowledge</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> quoted:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn Baakwaya said: ‘One day Abu Abdullaah bin Khaffeef saw Ibn Maktoom and his group and they were writing something, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are writing such and such.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Busy yourselves by learning something and do not be deceived by the speech of the<em>Soofeeyah</em>.  I used to hide my pen in the pocket of my rags and the paper in the pocket of my garment and I would go in hiding to the people of knowledge, if they (the<em>Soofeeyah</em>) found out I was there they would dispute with me and say: you will not be successful, but then eventually they were in need of me (this knowledge).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imam</em> ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This Shaykh had combined between knowledge and action and getting chains of narrations (Ahadeeth) from their sources, and would adhere to the <em>Sunnan</em> with a long enjoyable life in obedience to Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 16/346 &#8211; 347]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> quoted Ghazali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ghazali said: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> have taken to inspirational knowledge and not proper learnt knowledge, so one of them sits with his heart being empty, with total concern he says: ‘Allaah, Allaah, Allaah’ continuously so that his heart becomes empty. The <em>Soofeeyah</em> do not busy themselves with recitation of Qur’aan, nor with the books of Hadeeth.  So if the <em>Soofi</em>reaches this limit, then he stays in his house alone in the darkness and in a garment wrapped up, then at that time he hears the call of truth: &lt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muddathir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O you wrapped in garments (Prophet Muhammad)! &gt;&gt;[Surah Al-Muzzammil]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ad-Dhahabi (d.748) commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The leader of creation indeed heard &lt;&gt; [Surah Al-Muddathir] from Jibraeel from Allaah. As for this idiot, then he never heard the call of truth, rather he heard the Shaytaan, or he heard it from his fickled brain and did not hear it in reality, and success is adhering to the Sunnah and <em>al-Ijmaa’</em>(consensus).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 19/322-346]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A Rich Thankful Person and a Needy Patient Person who is Better?</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> after discussing the issue of: ‘The difference amongst the people about a rich thankful person and a needy patient person who is better?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The definition of <em>al-Faqar</em> (poverty – needy) according to many of the people, had become such that they regarded: <em>al-Faqar</em> to be <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners. They labeled the one described with <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners as a <em>Faqeer</em> (needy person) even though he possessed wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said about the one who is not described with <em>Zuhud</em>, worship and manners as not a <em>Faqeer</em> (needy person) even if he does not possess wealth, and perhaps it is possible that this meaning can be called <em>Tasawwuf</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people there are those who differentiate between the title <em>al-Faqeer</em>(needy person) and <em>as-Soofi</em>, then there are from these people who regard the term <em>al-Faqeer</em> better, and from them are those people who hold the view that the title <em>as-Soofi</em>is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Research into this issue shows that one should not look at innovated words, but one should look at what the Book and the Sunnah brought from words and meanings, indeed Allaah gave the description of His <em>Aawliya</em> which is that of <em>al-Eemaan</em> and <em>at-Taqwa</em> so whoever has a greater portion is better and the rich people are equivalent in regard to this, and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Udaatus Sabireen’ p.293]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Ibn al-Qayyim’s Refutation Against the Soofeeyah in their Rejection of Knowledge</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for what is narrated about some of them [i.e. the <em>Soofeeyah</em>] in that they regard knowledge as insignificant and them being in no need of knowledge, then that is like the one [<em>Soofee</em>] who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We take our knowledge directly from the living One, who does not die, as for you then you take it from one who lives and then dies [i.e. narrators of hadeeth].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one said when he was asked: ‘Why don’t you travel so that you can hear hadeeth from AbdurRazzaq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘What can I do with narrating from AbdurRazzaq, when someone hears directly from the Creator?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one [<em>Soofee</em>] said: ‘Knowledge is a veil between the heart and between Allaah – Azza wa Jal – [i.e. Prevents you from reaching Allaah].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another said: ‘If you see a <em>Soofee</em> busying himself with ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’ (he narrated to us) [These terms are used in narrating hadeeth] then wash your hands from him [i.e. keep away from him].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another one said: ‘We have knowledge from numerical codes and you have knowledge from papers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> comments on their statements by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the conditions of those who say these statements and other similar statements is that he is an ignoramus who can be excused for his ignorance. Or a negligent person who acknowledges his negligence, or otherwise if it was not for AbdurRazzaq and the likes of him [scholars of hadeeth], and if it was not for ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’ (he narrated to us) then nothing of Islaam would have reached this person and those similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever directs you to other than ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’(he narrated to us) then he has directed you to either, <em>Soofee</em> fiction, or philosophical analogy, or to his own personal opinion.  There is nothing after the Qur’aan or ‘<em>Akhbarana</em>’ (he informed us) and ‘<em>Haddathana</em>’(he narrated to us) except the doubts of the people of theological rhetoric and the opinions of the deviant people, and the imaginations of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, and analogies of the philosophers. Whoever separates himself from the evidences then he becomes misguided away from the correct path, there is no evidence to lead to Allaah and Paradise except the Book and the Sunnah.  Every path which is not accompanied with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah is from the path of Hell and the Shaytaan <em>nirajeem</em> (accursed Shaytaan).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Madarij   vol.2 p.438-439]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muhammad bin Idrees Sha’fiee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> (d.204 A.H.) said in a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قال الشافعي رحمه الله<br />
كل العلوم سوى القرآن مشغلة                            إلا الحديث وعلم الفقه والدين<br />
العلم ما كان فيه قال حدثنا                                                                     وما سوى ذلك وساوس الشياطين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every knowledge other than the Qur’aan is a distraction *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except the hadeeth and the knowledge of <em>Fiqh</em> of the <em>Deen</em> *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is that which has ‘He said’ ‘he narrated to us’ *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything other than that is whisperings of <em>Shayateen</em> *</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [42]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from his attributes <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>خاتم الأنبياء </strong>– <strong>“The last (or seal) of the Prophets.”</strong>  The meaning of “<em><u>kh</u>aatam</em>” (خاتم &#8211; seal) is the one whom no Prophet will come after.  And the <em><u>kh</u>itaam</em> (ختام – seal) of anything is that which is placed upon it as a seal upon it so that nothing can be added to that thing and nothing can be taken away from it.  So Allaah sealed the Messengership with Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  He the Majestic, in His Highness, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men; but rather, he is the Messenger of Allaah and the seal (last) of the Prophets.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no need for the coming of any Prophet after him because the Qur.aan is present and the Prophetic Sunnah is present and the <em>`ulamaa. ar-rabbaaniyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people upon the correct way) are present – calling the people to Allaah and giving clarity to the people.  So therefore, the religion of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will remain until the establishment of the Last Hour.  It will not be changed, and it will not be abrogated, and it will not be altered because Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, has made it suitable and fitting for every time and every place.  And as for the revealed laws of the previous Prophets, then they were temporary for their nations in particular times and then Allaah abrogated those legislated laws from before, with other legislated laws suitable for other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For every people from you, we made a set of revealed laws and a clear way to proceed upon.</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>For every revealed Book there is a set time period</em></span> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, each Book (from the previous Books) has a set time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religion of Islaam is complete.  It does not need any Messenger after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And the scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.  So whoever holds the belief that there will come after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> any Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of the religion.  And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that there were going to come liars, falsely claiming Prophethood after him.  He <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سيأتي بعدي كذابون ثلاثون، كلهم يدعي أنه نبي، وأنا خاتم الأنبياء لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“There will come after me thirty great liars, each one of them claiming that he is a prophet and I am the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims Prophethood, or has Prophethood claimed on his behalf, or whoever follows them, then all of them are unbelievers (<em>kuffaar</em>).  And the Muslims have fought against them and have declared them to be unbelievers.  And the last of those whose followers claimed that he was a Prophet in this present time was that <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>.  And these people (the <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>) are called the <em>A<u>h</u>madees</em> as an ascription to his name because his name was A<u>h</u>mad <em>Al-Qaadiyaanee</em> (أحمد القادياني) and the scholars declared him to be an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and they repelled him from the lands of Islaam and the declared his followers to be unbelievers since this is a denial of Allaah and of His Messenger.  And their being unbelievers is by consensus of the Muslims; no one disagrees about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is essential that the Muslim believes that he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is the last of the Prophets and Messengers and he is the leader of those having <em>taqwaa</em> (those dutiful to Allaah); meaning, that he is the single example to be followed for those who are obedient and dutiful to Allaah, the Mighty and  Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed a fine example for you in Allaah’s Messenger for whoever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day</span></em>. (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for others besides the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he is only to be followed if he himself is following the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And as for a person who contradicts the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If you truly love Allaah then follow me, then Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.” </span></em>(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no way towards Allaah except by following the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and proceeding upon his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term: <strong>وسيد المرسلين</strong> – <strong>“And he is the noblest of the Messengers;” </strong>that is him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>; he is the noblest of the sons of Aadam just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said about himself,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏أنا سيد ولد آدم ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and that is not boasting.”</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the statement, <strong><em>“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and this is not a boast,”</em></strong> he informed his nation of that as part of giving thanks to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and also so that the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation) should give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for this favour – that He made its Messenger the noblest of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word “<em>sayyid</em>” (سيد – the noblest) means <em>al-muqaddim</em> (المقدم – the foremost one) and <em>al-imaam</em> (الإمام – the leader).  So he is the best of the Messengers `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and he is their <em>imaam</em> (leader) and he is at the head of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the term: <strong>حبيب رب العالمين</strong> – <strong>“the beloved one of the Lord of the whole of creation,”</strong> the term ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (حبيب) is a term which has a point of criticism against it because it is not sufficient to say (that the Messenger `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is) ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (the beloved one).  Rather, he is the ‘<em><u>kh</u>aleel</em>’ – the ‘especially close beloved one’ of the Lord of the creation (خليل رب العالمين).  And <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (خلة) is more excellent than just <em>ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (محبة &#8211; love) because <em>al-ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (love) is of levels and the highest of its levels is <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> which is the purest love. And no one attained this level except for two men from the creation: Ibraaheem `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (especially close beloved one)</span></em> (Sooratun-Nisaa.  (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, because he himself informed about that saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن الله اتخذني خليلًا كما اتخذ إبراهيم خليلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah took me as an especially close beloved one just as He took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (an especially close beloved one).” </em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it should not be said about him that he is <em><u>H</u>abeebullaah</em> – a beloved one of Allaah, because this term is suitable for every believer and there is nothing special for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it.  But as for being <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (an especially beloved one), then no one (from this Ummah) shares with him in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [42][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43] وكل دعوى النبوة بعده فغي وهوى‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43]     Every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous and baseless desires.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [43]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has preceded in the meaning of his being ‘the seal and last of the Prophets’.  So therefore, every claim to Prophethood after him is futile and is unbelief since there will not come any Prophet after our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  And as for `Eesaa `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, when he descends at the end of time, then it will not be upon the basis that he is a Prophet and a Messenger, nor upon the basis that he is coming with a new revealed Law.  Rather, he will come upon the basis that he is a <em>Mujaddid</em> (مجدد – Reviver) for the religion of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>on the basis that he is one following the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will judge with the Islaamic <em><u>Sh</u>aree</em>`<em>ah</em> (Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of  <u>Th</u>awbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> and the basis of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> Muslim but this full wording is reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee; declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee that <u>Th</u>awbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لا تقوم الساعة حتى تلحق قبائل من أمتي بالمشركين وحتى يعبدوا الأوثان وإنه سيكون في أمتي ثلاثون كذابون كلهم يزعم أنه نبي وأنا خاتم النبيين لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘The last hour will not be established until some tribes of my nation join with the mu<u>sh</u>riks and until they worship the idols and there will be in my nation thirty great liars, each one claiming that he is a prophet and I am the seal of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me’.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Sa`eed Al-<u>Kh</u>udree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>; declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>is reported by Muslim and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdillaah ibn Mas`ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لو كنت متخذًا من أهل الأرض خليلًا لاتخذت ابن أبي قحافة خليلًا، ولكن صاحبكم خليل الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“If I were to take a specially beloved friend from the people of the earth, I would have taken Ibn Abee Qu<u>h</u>aafah (Aboo Bakr) as an especially close beloved friend; however, your companion (meaning himself) is the <u>Kh</u>aleel of Allaah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: There is a narration that <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee points out is weak in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah.  It is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> and in it is quoted that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ألا وأنا حبيب الله ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“I am the <u>H</u>abeeb (beloved one) of Allaah and that’s not boasting.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions that this narration is <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak), not authentic.  It is weak because it has the narrator Zam`ah ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and also the narrator Salamah ibn Wahraam.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58] (continued from Lesson 16)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) except the people of innovation such as the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> – those who negate the <em>ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen by the believers). They say: This (affirming seeing Allaah) would necessitate that Allaah is in a direction (جهة &#8211; <em>jihah</em>). And it is their view that Allaah is not in a direction; and in their view He is not within the creation, nor is He outside it, nor is He above, nor is He below, nor is He to the right, nor is He to the justify; He is not in any direction. And the meaning of this is that He does not exist, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  So, they deny seeing Allaah because of this futile opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>A<u>sh</u>aa`irah</em>, when they were not able to deny the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah then they affirmed seeing Allaah, but they said: He will be seen, but not in any direction. And this is an amazing contradiction! Because, there is nothing that is seen which is not in a direction; and therefore the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> refuted them for this because it is something impossible. Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> (the people of the Sunnah), they say: He the Perfect and Most High will be seen and He is in the direction of <em>al-`uloo</em> (العلو – being elevated) and above them. Because the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (الجهة – direction), if what is meant by it is a direction within the creation, then in that sense Allaah is not in any such direction because Allaah is not incarnate within His creation, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if what is meant by it, is that He is Exalted and above all of the creation then this is something confirmed for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, Allaah is indeed Exalted and High above the heavens. So the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (direction) is neither affirmed nor denied directly in text. However, it can be spoken of with the previous details.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <strong>“…without their encompassing Him and without saying how”</strong>: They cannot encompass Allaah the Mighty and Majestic; they will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. And Allaah is <em>A<u>z</u>eem</em> (عظيم – Tremendous); it is not possible that He can be encompassed. He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And they do not encompass Him in Knowledge</em></span> (Soorah <u>T</u>aaHaa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot grasp Him</span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: sight cannot encompass Him; it doesn’t mean that He cannot be seen, because Allaah the Perfect and Most High did not say, “Sight will not see Him (لا تراه الأبصار).” Rather, He said, “<strong>Sight will not grasp Him</strong>.” So, reaching and grasping is something and <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing) is something else. So sight will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. So this contains a refutation of those who seek to use this <em>aayah</em> as a proof to deny <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen) – those who say that seeing Allaah is not possible, saying: because Allaah said, “<strong>Sight will not encompass Him.</strong>” So we say to them: You do not know the meaning of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight </span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>aayah,</em> “<strong>Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight,</strong>” its meaning is: He will not be encompassed by that. It doesn’t mean that He won’t be seen; and He the Perfect did not say: “Sight will not see Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they also use as evidence, saying: Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Lord, show me Yourself, let me look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me.”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They say) this is a proof negating <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say to them: This refers to this world because Moosaa asked for that in this world and no one will see Allaah in this world – neither any Prophet nor anyone else. But as for in the Hereafter, then the believers will certainly see their Lord. And the conditions in the world are not the same as the conditions in the Hereafter. So the people in this world are weak in their bodies and weak in their senses; they are not able to see Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. But as for in the Hereafter, then Allaah will give them the ability by which they will be able to see their Lord, the Majestic and Most High, (He would give this) as an honour for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, when Moosaa asked his Lord in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He said, “You will not see Me; however, look at the mountain and if it remains in its place then you shall see Me.” So when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He caused it to shatter to dust. </span></em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountain shattered and turned to dust; and the mountain is inanimate and solid, so how about the created being who is composed of flesh and blood and bones? He is not able to see Allaah in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this question that Moosaa asked, to see Allaah, is a proof that it is permissible to see Him and possible (to see Him); because Moosaa would not ask his Lord for anything which is not permissible. Rather, he asked Him for something which is permissible; but, it would not occur in this world. So therefore, Allaah the Perfect said, “<strong>You will not see Me,</strong>” and He did not say “I cannot be seen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed be seen in the Hereafter,[2] and those who have the most right to this seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) are the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And we do not say how this will be</strong>” meaning: it is not to be said, “How will they see Allaah?” because this is just like the rest of the Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – we do not know how they are. So, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them (we believe in them) and we know their meaning and we affirm them. However, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (كيفية– how they are) is unknown; we do not know it. So Allaah knows better about that, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> End of explanation of point [58] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[59]     Just as is stated by the Book of our Lord: “On that Day some faces will be radiant, shining, looking at their Lord.” (Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75) <em>aayaat</em> 22-3).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clearly states that it is looking upon Allaah with sight since the term for ‘looking’ is used with <em>ilaa</em> (إلى – the particle ‘towards’). So its meaning is ‘looking with sight’. Whereas the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say: ﭽ ﭝ  ﭞﭼ <em>‘ilaa’</em> (إلى) here is a plural and it means ‘blessings’; so (they say) it means: ‘they will be looking at the Blessings of their Lord’ and this is foolish delusion which people of intellect would laugh at since a particle doesn’t become plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60] وتَفْسيرُهُ عَلى ما أرادَهُ اللهُ تَعالَى وَعَلِمَه‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60]     And its explanation is as Allaah the Most High, wanted and knew.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the explanation of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking upon their Lord </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (its explanation) is just as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic wanted, and that is that it means ‘seeing with sight’. Its explanation is not as the innovators want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61] وكلُّ ما جاءَ في ذَلِكَ مِنَ الحديثِ الصَّحيحِ عَنِ الرسولِ صلَّى الله عليه وآله وسلَّم فهو كما قال‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61]     And every authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported from the Messenger, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em> (may Allaah extol him and his true followers and grant him perfect peace and security), then it is just as he said.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: everything reported from the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> affirming that Allaah will be seen, then it is true upon its reality – just the same as what occurs in the Qur.aan. It is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> in it because it is the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>which is <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he (the Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) does not speak from his own desires; it is just revelation inspired. </span></em>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it (the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is called ‘the second Revelation’. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed in many <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people) that the believers would see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in that, without <em>ta<u>h</u>reef </em>(تحريف – altering the meaning) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل – negating) and without <em>tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (تمثيل<em> – </em>likening Him to His creation) and without <em>takyeef</em> (تكييف<em> – </em>saying ‘how’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62] وَمَعناهُ على ما أرادَ‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62]     And its meaning is as He intended.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: as the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended (when he said it), not as those innovators and deviants intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [62][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In Shaykh Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen’s abridgement of Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah, Talqees Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah (تلخيص الحموية) of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, he mentioned a point right near the beginning, which was: that the people of the Sunnah in affirming Allaah’s Attributes, (first principle:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we affirm for Allaah whatever He affirmed for Himself or whatever His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> affirmed for Him, (second principle:) and we deny/negate for Allaah whatever He negated for Himself or the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>negated for Him. Thirdly, where there is something that is not denied in text, nor is it affirmed in text, from those things which the people disagree about, such as the term ‘a body’ (جسم – <em>j</em><em>ism</em>) or ‘<em>al-<u>h</u>eez</em>’ (being in a place) and ‘<em>al-jihah’</em> (being in a direction) and the like of that, then their way (the people of the Sunnah) is <em>at-tawaqquf</em> – to stop and withhold with regard to its wording. So they don’t affirm its wording and they don’t deny it since it is not reported. And as for its meaning, then we ask for the detail of what is meant by it, and if we find that what is meant by it is something futile and false – something which Allaah is declared free of, then we reject it; and if what is meant by it is something true – something which is not prohibited for Allaah, then we accept it. This is their way and this is the obligatory way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on in the book (page 45) he actually goes into detail about <em>al-jihah. </em>He mentioned that the later people brought this term up (<em>al-jihah</em> – direction) and he deals with it in this way i.e. if what they mean is a direction within the creation then we deny that for Allaah and if what they mean by that is that Allaah is above the heavens, then we affirm that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] On the authority of Aboo Moosaa Al-A<u>sh</u>`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْنٍ‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>“There will be two gardens containing silver – their utensils and whatever they contain, and two gardens of gold &#8211; their utensils and whatever they contain, and nothing will be between the people in the eternal garden and their looking upon their Lord, except the cloak of rightful pride upon His Face.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in the Book of <em>Tafseer</em>, <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 4878 and 4880 and reported by Muslim in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made a fairly small point on this point here. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know that the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported affirming the believers seeing their Lord on the Day of Resurrection are very many – to the extent that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> as has been clearly stated by a group of the <em>imaams</em>. From them, the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz), and he mentioned some of them and then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about the <em>ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) are reported by around thirty companions and whoever acquired comprehensive knowledge of them will state with certainty that the Messenger (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) definitely said it and if I had not put it upon myself to write this book in abridged form, then I would quote more of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> </em>here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, “The declaration that seeing Allaah the Most High will be like seeing the Sun and the Moon is not <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (تشبيه) of Allaah (causing Allaah to resemble His creation). Rather, it is a statement that the ‘act’ of seeing is like ‘that’ act of seeing – not that the One seen is like the thing which is seen. However, it does contain an evidence that Allaah is above His creation; since, can any seeing be comprehended without facing? And as for those people who say, ‘He will be seen, but not in a direction,’ then this person should look back and check his own intellect because either he is opposing obstinately his correct intellect or his intellect has got something wrong with it. Or otherwise a person saying, ‘He will be seen but He will not be in front, He will not be behind, He will not be to the right, He will not be to the justify, He will not be above and He will not be below;’ (then this is not correct) anyone who hears this, whose nature is sound, then he will reject it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: And as for His, He the Most High, being seen in this world, then the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said in the authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that none of us will see Him until he dies. <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim. And as for him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then there is nothing reported to affirm that he even saw his Lord. Indeed, there is something authentic from him which indicates a denial of this because when he was asked about this he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">نور، أنى أراه</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Meaning:  <span style="color:#339966;"> “Light, how could I see Him”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And along with this, the noble lady `Aa.ishah (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>) clearly denied this (that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw his Lord) as occurs in the two <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>’s; and that is the basic principle which we cling to.”</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Chapter 14: We do not Call a Muslim an Unbeliever Due to his Sins</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] Ahl us-Sunnab believe that if a Believer commits sins, however small or large they may be, he does not become an unbeliever. If he leaves this world without making any repentance from them and he dies upon Tawheed and Ikhlaas, then his affair is entirely up to Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic. If He wills, He may forgive him and enter him into Paradise on the Day of judgement, safe and sound without being afflicted by the fire and without being punished for his perpetration of the sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will be brought on the Day of judgement with his sins and misdeeds. If Allaah wills, He will punish him for a period in the Fire. If He punishes him, he will not however remain in the Fire forever, but he will eventually be freed and taken out from it, to the place of tranquility and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[101] Our Shaykh, the Imaam Aboo Tayyeb Sahl ibn Muhammad as- Sa’lookee, raheemahullaah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The sinning believer, even if he is punished by the fire, he will not be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire. He will not remain there the same way as the unbeliever will remain there nor will he be wretched and miserable the same way the unbeliever is wretched and miserable.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[102] This means that the unbeliever will be dragged to the Fire on his face, he will be thrown in there chained, and then hung upside down, shackled by having his hands tied to his neck with strong and heavy chains. However, the sinning believer, if he is afflicted by the Fire, he will enter it like a criminal enters a prison in this world on his feet, not upside down nor thrown in. The meaning of his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;he will not, be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire&#8230;,” means that the unbeliever will have all his body burned and every time his skin is roasted through it will be replaced with another, so that he may taste the punishment again, as Allaah informs us in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, those who have disbelieved in our signs, we shall burn them in a fire. We shall change their skins for other skins, so that they may taste the punishment again.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4;56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believers they will not have their faces scorched by the Fire, and their limbs which they used for sujood will not be burned. For Allaah has forbidden the Fire from burning them. “ [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[103] His saying: “&#8230;he will not stay in the Fire like the unbeliever would&#8230;”, means that the unbeliever will remain in it forever and never come out of it. Allaah will never leave any sinning believer in the Fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “&#8230;he will not be afflicted like the unbeliever”, means that the unbeliever has no hope of the Mercy of Allah and no opportunity for reprieve from the punishment. As for the believer he will never be cut off from the hope of the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final outcome for all the believers is Paradise, as they were created for it and it was created for them, as a Mercy and a Blessing from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[113] The prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: &#8220;Allaah has forbidden the fire to eat up the traces of Sujood&#8221;. Related by al-Bukhaaree [806] and Muslim [182]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following  is excerpted from Fatwa of <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ali Ferkous</strong> from his website. Full fatwa can be read @ </em></span><em><a href="http://ferkous.com/home/?q=en/fatwa-en-592" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ferkous.com/home/?q=en/fatwa-en-592</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the heresies innovated by <strong><em>Ar-Râfida</em></strong><sup>(<a name="_ftnref3"></a>3)</sup>, like the fact of imposing thirst to themselves and showing sadness as well as other innovations, like considering this day a day of sorrow and, on the other hand, <strong><em>An-Nâssiba</em></strong><sup>(<a name="_ftnref4"></a>4)</sup> who show joy and happiness and expend much in this day; neither the former nor the latter have a valid origin on which to rely, but there are only invented hadiths attributed falsely to the Prophet صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم or weak hadiths that do not reach the degree of validity to be taken as proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sheikh Al-Islâm Ibn Taymiya</strong> رحمه الله demonstrated this by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">“Like what was innovated by some people who follow their passions during the day of `Ashura, as making themselves thirsty, showing sadness, gathering and other heresies that are not legislated neither by Allah nor by His Prophet صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم and none of the Salaf (Predecessors) or one of Ahl-Al-Bayt (The Prophet’s صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّمFamily) or others… this was an affliction to the Muslims &#8211; that is to say, the murder of Al-Hussayn رضي الله عنه &#8211; and that should be dealt with like other calamities by saying the legal Istirjâ`<sup>(<a style="color:#800000;" name="_ftnref5"></a>5)</sup>. Yet, some heretics innovated, during this day, acts that contradict what Allah عزَّ وجلَّ ordered to do when a calamity occurs. They added to that calumnies and denigration of the Companions who are innocent of killing Al-Hussayn رضي الله عنه and other things that Allah عزَّ وجلَّ and His Prophet صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم detest… As for the fact of considering days of calamities as days of bereavement, this does not belong to the Islamic religion but rather to the religion of the pre-Islamic period”,</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then Ibn Taymiya رحمه اللهsaid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">“Some people innovated things during this day (`Ashura) on the basis of invented hadiths that have no valid origin like: the merit of taking a ritual bath in this day, to make up with kohl and shaking hands. All these things and others are innovated and hateful, but what is recommended is to fast during this day… apparently, as regards the invention of these hadiths, when chauvinism appeared between <em>An-Nâssiba</em> and <em>Ar-Râfida, </em>the former made the day of `Ashura a day of bereavement, and the latter invented texts that require expending copiously and making of `Ashura a holiday. However, these two ways are false”<sup>(<a style="color:#800000;" name="_ftnref6"></a>6)</sup>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we know that what was prescribed during this day is limited to fasting, it is not allowed to answer the invitation of someone who considers it a day of bereavement, nor someone who considers it a holiday, because it is not allowed to alter the sharia of Allah عزَّ وجلَّ for the sake of someone or rectify and add something to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://ferkous.com/home/?q=en/fatwa-en-592#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) <strong><em>Ar-Râfida</em></strong>: a sect belonging to the large sect of Shiites, they took the oath of allegiance to Zayd Ibn `Ali, and asked him to renounce the two Sheikhs (Abu Bakr and `Umar رضي الله عنهما), so he disagreed with them, then they left and refused him, that is to say: they boycotted him and gave up their oath of allegiance. Among their principles:<strong> <em>Al-&#8216;Imâma</em></strong> (The imamship of twelve members of the lineage of the Prophet صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم), <strong><em>Al-`Isma</em> </strong>(The infallibility of the twelve imams), <strong><em>Al-Mahdiyya </em></strong>(They believe in a person of the lineage of the Prophet صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم whose name is Muhammad Ibn Al-Hassan Al-`Askari who will come back at the end of the world),<strong><em> At-Taqiyya</em></strong> (To show the contrary of what one believes), in addition to insulting the Companions and other principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) <strong><em>An-Nâssiba</em></strong>: those who detest Ali رضي الله عنه and his companions. See: “Majmû`Al-Fatâwa” (25/301).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) Saying: <em>“Inna Lillâh Wa Inna Ilayhi Râji`ûn”</em> (Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) See: “Iqtidhâ&#8217; As-Sirât Al-Mustaqîm” of Ibn Taymiya (2/129-133).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Text from <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foundation-of-sunnah-imam-ahmad.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Usool as Sunnah (Foundations of Sunnah)</a></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>19.For indeed, (indulging in) theological rhetoric (kalaam) in [22] the matter of Qadar, the Ru’yah, the Qur’aan and other such issues are among the ways that are detested and which are forbidden.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>20. The one Who does so, even if he reaches the truth with his words, is not from Ahlus-Sunnah, until he abandons (using) this mode of argumentation, [and until he] submits and believes in the aathaar (the Prophetic Narrations and those of the Companions [23]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d. 204H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm leaves and shoes and be paraded amongst the kinsfolk and the tribes with it being announced, ‘This is the reward of the one who abandons the Book and the Sunnah and turns to theological rhetoric (kalaam).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sharh ‘AqeedatitTahaawiyyah of lbn Abil-’Izz, p. 75.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abdul-Barr said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The people of Fiqh and Aathaar in all the various towns and cities are agreed unanimously that the Ahlul-Kalaam (People of Theological Rhetoric) are (but) Ahlul-Bida’ waz-Zaigh (the People of Innovations and Deviation). And they are not considered, by all of the above, to be amongst the ranks of the Scholars (in truth).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d. 204H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“That a person is put to trial with everything that Allaah has forbidden, besides Shirk, is better than that he looks at Kalaam (theological rhetoric).” He also said, “If people knew what (misleading and destructive) desires are contained within theological rhetoric they would certainly flee from it as they would from a lion,”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">he also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever showed boldness in approaching theological rhetoric will never prosper.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Scholars of ash-Shaash said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Every knowledge save that of the Qur’aan is a pre-occupation</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Except for the Hadeeth and Fiqh (understanding) of the Deen</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Knowledge is only that about which it is said,</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Haddathanaa &#8230;‘ (So and so narrated to us)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And what is besides that</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Are but whisperings of the Shayaateen (devils)”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Yoosuf, the companion of Aboo Haneefah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Whoever sought knowledge by kalaam (theological rhetoric) will turn a heretical apostate,” and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 241H) said, “The person of theological rhetoric will never prosper. And never do you see anyone looking into theological rhetoric except that in his heart is a desire for creating mischief.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both narrations are reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Muhammad Ibn Seereen (d. 110H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (i.e., the Companions and the Taabi’een) used to consider themselves upon the path (of truth) so long as they held onto the narrations.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh Usolil It’iqaad, no. 110.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaadh ibn Yahyaa said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no path which is more straight and direct (in leading) to Paradise than the path of the one who travels upon the aathaar (narrations).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh UsoolilIt’qaad no. 112.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullah ibn alMubaarak (d. 181H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I found that the affair was Ittibaa’ (following and imitation, i.e., following and submission to the narrations).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh Usoolil-l’tiqaad, no. 113</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Show reverence to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) by honouring the members of his family.&#8221;</strong></span> </span>[Al-Bukhari].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Yazid bin Haiyan reported: I went along with Husain bin Sabrah and `Amr bin Muslim to Zaid bin Arqam (May Allah be pleased with them) and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>Zaid, you acquired great merits, you saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), listened to him talking, fought by his side in (different) battles, and offered Salat (prayer) behind him. Zaid, you have indeed earned great merits. Could you narrate to us what you heard from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;By Allah! I have grown old and have almost spent up my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), so accept what I narrate to you, do not compel me to narrate what I fail to narrate&#8221;. He then said, &#8220;One day Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up to deliver a Khutbah at a watering place known as Khumm between Makkah and Al-Madinah. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and exhorted (us) and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Amma Ba`du. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Rubb and I will respond to Allah&#8217;s Call, but I am leaving with you two weighty things: the first is the Book of Allah, in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it.&#8217; He exhorted (us to hold fast) to the Book of Allah</span> and then said,<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The second is the members of my household, I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family. I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family.</span></strong> Husain said to Zaid, &#8220;Who are the members of his household, O Zaid? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family?&#8221; Thereupon Zaid said, &#8220;His wives are the members of his family. (But here) the members of his family are those for whom Zakat is forbidden&#8221;. &nbsp;He asked, &#8220;Who are they?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;Ali and the offspring of `Ali, `Aqil and the offspring of `Aqil and the offspring of Ja`far and the offspring of `Abbas.&#8221; Husain asked, &#8220;For all of them the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden?&#8221; Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</p>

<p><span style="color: #008000">As for the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em>, and they are the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>– and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible. &nbsp;However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.</span></p>



<p>.. <span style="color: #008000">Therefore, <strong>whatever is less than <em>Shirk</em> then it is under the Will of Allaah</strong>, and committing suicide is less then <em>Shirk</em>, likewise is <em>Zina</em> (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.&nbsp; All of these things are sins that are less than <em>Shirk</em>, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.&nbsp; If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that follow <strong>Muhammad Ilyaas</strong>, the founder of this Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A biography of the founder:</strong></span> Muhammad Ilyaas was born in 1302H. He memorized the Qur’aan and read the Six Collections of Hadeeth. [2] He was upon the Deobandi methodology, taking the Hanafee madh-hab, the Ash’aree and Matureedee Creed and the Sufi way. They have four Sufi orders amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Naqshabandees<br />
2. The Sahroordees<br />
3. The Qaadirees, and<br />
4. The Jishtees</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyaas gave the Sufi bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to <strong>Shaikh Rasheed Al-Kankoohee, </strong>who later became<strong> Shaikh Rasheed As-Saharanpuree</strong>. Then he renewed it with Shaikh Ahmad As-Saharanpuree who certified him to take oaths of allegiance. Muhammad Ilyaas would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee, in what is known as the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation). And he would go out to the grave of ‘Abdul-Qudoos Al-Kankoohee, the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood [3] on him. He resided and taught in Delhi and passed away in 1363H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Circumstances that brought about the start of the movement:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Abul-Hasan An-Nadwee saw that Muhammad Ilyaas took refuge in this way of giving Da’wah when the ways of blind-following failed to rectify the people of his region. Shaikh Miyaan Muhammad Aslam quotes one of Ilyaas’ sayings that he received kashf (mystic disclosure) to follow this way through a dream in which he was inspired with a new tafseer (interpretation) of Allaah’s saying: <b>“You were the best nation brought out for mankind, commanding good and forbidding evil and believing in Allaah.”</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] And it was that going out (khurooj) to call people to the way of Allaah cannot be realized by staying in one place based on Allaah’s word <b>“brought out”</b> and that one’s Eemaan increases by going out in this khurooj based on Allaah’s saying: <b>“and believing in Allaah”</b> after having said:<b>“brought out for mankind.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The following can be noted from what has just been mentioned:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Qur’aan is not interpreted by makshoofaat (mystical disclosures), and by Sufi dreams, of which the majority of them, rather all of them come from the inspirations of the Devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is apparent from what was stated previously that the founder of this Jamaa’ah was engrossed in Sufism from head to toe. This is because he gave two oaths of allegiance on it and was tested by its false beliefs and because he would spend his time sitting by the graves of Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a <strong>qubooree</strong> (grave worshipper) and a <strong>khuraafee</strong>. This is clear from his saying: “…and he would sit in detached isolation (<strong>khalwah</strong>) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee.” And concerning the second person, he mentioned that he forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him. So his being attached to the grave of the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him is without doubt a clear proof that he held that same belief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Those who believe in <strong>wahdat-ul-wujood</strong> claim that Allaah embodies Himself inside the attractive woman – and refuge is sought from Allaah! This is a matter that has reached the highest level of repulsiveness. May Allaah give them what they deserve of His curses and wrath!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The methodology of the Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh can be summarized in six issues or six principles or six characteristics:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Actualizing the statement of Tawheed: <i>“Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah”</i> (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and Muhammad is His Messenger)<br />
2. Praying with full submissiveness and humility<br />
3. Knowledge of the Virtues (<i>Fadaa’il</i>) and not the Fiqh issues (<i>Masaa’il</i>) along with knowledge of dhikr<br />
4. Showing generosity to the Muslim<br />
5. Correcting the intention<br />
6. Calling to Allaah (i.e. Da’wah) and going out (i.e. khurooj) for that purpose in the Way of Allaah upon the tablighi manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an objective behind each of these six principles or characteristics as well as a virtue to be attained. So for example the objective behind (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>) is to: “Eradicate the corrupted yaqeen (Certainty) from the heart while placing the correct and valid yaqeen into the Essence (dhaat) of Allaah.” They really intend the belief of wahdat-ul-wujood with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Point to be noted about Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was raised upon Sufism and gave two oaths of allegiance on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He would position himself by graves, waiting to receive <strong>Kashf</strong> (Sufi mystical disclosure) and meditative ideas from the deceased inside them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He would perform the <strong>Jishtee Muraaqabah</strong> (self meditation) at the gravesite of ‘Abdul-Quddoos Al-Kankoohee, who used to believe in wahadat-ul-wujood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Jishtee Muraaqabah is to sit by a grave for half an hour of every week, covering the face and reciting this dhikr: “<em>Allaahu Haadiree, Allaahu Naadhiree</em>.” [4] This statement or this action if done sincerely for Allaah is an innovation. And if it is done for the person in the grave then it is committing Shirk with Allaah. And the last of the two is what is most evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They have four of their graves located in the masjid from where their Da’wah emerged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The founder of this Jamaa’ah believed in Kashf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a grave worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The Tablighis perform their worship with an innovated form of dhikr, done in the way of the Sufis. This is by splitting up the statement of Tawhheed (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Whoever cuts off the negation part of the Statement of Tawheed from its affirmation part intentionally, by saying “Laa Ilaaha” (only), then this necessitates the fact that he has committed disbelief. Shaikh Hamood At-Tuwayjiree stated this, quoting it from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They make it permissible to wear amulets that have on them mystical writings and names of unknown people, which probably are names of devils! And this is not permissible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Question:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Noble Shaikh! The Qur’aaniyoon [3] say: Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ تَفْصِيلًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation.”<br />
</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book.”</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> [Surah Al-An’aam: 38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Verily this Qur’aan – part of it is in the Hand of Allaah and part of it is in your hands. So hold fast onto it, for you will never go astray nor will you ever be ruined after it.”</strong> [4]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">We would like your comments on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Answer:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book”</strong>, what is meant by the word “<strong>Book</strong>” here is the Preserved Tablet and not the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for Allaah’s statement: <strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation”</strong>, if you attach what was explained previously to the Noble Qur’aan, then it becomes certain that Allaah has indeed explained everything in detail, however with another provision. You are aware that an explanation may at times be general, such as when one places general rules under which exist many particulars the likes of which cannot be confined due to their large number. So by the Wise Legislator placing well known rules for these many particulars, the meaning of the noble ayah becomes apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation may also be detailed, and this is what is obvious from this ayah as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not left behind anything that Allaah commanded me with except that I have ordered you to do it. And I have not left behind anything that Allaah forbade me from except that I have forbidden you from it.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation may at times be with rules, which many particulars (and details) fall under. And at other times it may be in such detail in terms of the vocabulary of the acts of worship and laws that it does not require being referenced to any of these rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the rules that numerous branches fall under – and which show the greatness of Islaam and the vast scope of Islaam in legislating – for example, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“There is no harming (of oneself) or others.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every intoxicant is alcohol and every alcohol is unlawful.”</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are rules and generalizations that do not exclude anything related to harming of one’s self or harming of one’s wealth, with respect to the first hadeeth, nor does it exclude anything related to that which intoxicates, with respect to the second hadeeth, whether the intoxicant is derived from grapes, which is the most popular form, or from corn or from any other substance. So long as the product is an intoxicant, it is unlawful (Haraam).</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#808080;">[<strong>Note</strong>: Read </span><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/07/16/the-need-for-the-sunnah-in-order-to-understand-the-quraan/">The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan </a><span style="color:#808080;">– Shaykh al Albaani]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the third hadeeth – it is not possible to take into account the number of innovations due to their large amount. It is not possible to account for all of them. However in spite of this, this hadeeth – even though brief in size – states with all clarity: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a detailed statement but with rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the laws that you are aware of, they are explained in detail by words that have been mentioned in the Sunnah in most cases and at times they are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan as is the case with the laws of inheritance, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth that was mentioned in the question, then it is an authentic hadeeth, and acting upon it is what we should try to adhere to as stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“I have left two things amongst you by which you will never go astray so long as you hold steadfast onto them: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.”</strong> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So holding steadfast onto the Rope of Allaah – which is in our hands – refers to acting upon the Sunnah, which explains the noble Qur’aan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Weak Hadeeth from Mu’aadh regarding Opinion, and what is Rejected from it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I finish my talk, I feel that it is necessary for me to direct the attention of the brothers in attendance to a famous hadeeth, which seldom is missing from the books on the Principles of Fiqh. I will mention it because <strong>it is weak</strong>, from the perspective of its chain of narration as well as it being in contradiction with what I spoke about in this talk, which was <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the lack of there being any distinction between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah when it comes to deriving Laws, and the obligation of accepting these two sources together</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to him when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“With what will you judge by?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “By the Book of Allaah.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “Then by the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He replied: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “I will strive to form my own opinion.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>So he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “All praise be to Allaah who guided the messenger of Allaah’s Messenger to that which Allaah’s Messenger loves.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakness of its chain, then this is not the place to discuss it now. But I clarified this exhaustively, perhaps the likes of which was not undertaken in the past, in (my book) the <strong>“Silsilah”</strong> (of weak hadeeth) I mentioned previously. [4] But suffice it to say now that the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in Hadeeth, Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, said about this hadeeth that it was “rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So having said this, it is now possible for me to begin explaining the contradiction it </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#993300;">poses, which I stated earlier. So I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth establishes a methodology of ruling for the judge, based on three stages. He is not permitted to seek a ruling from his opinion unless after he acknowledges he can’t find it in the Sunnah. Nor is he allowed to derive a ruling from the Sunnah until after he establishes he can’t find it in the Qur’aan. With respect to the opinion, this method (of deriving a ruling) is valid and correct according to all of the scholars, which is why they would say: “When the narration is mentioned, the opinion is nullified.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with respect to the Sunnah, this method is not correct, because the Sunnah determines and explains the Book of Allaah. So it is obligatory for one to look for the ruling in the Sunnah, even if he thinks that it exists in the Qur’aan, based on what we stated previously. So the Sunnah with respect to the Qur’aan is not like the opinion with respect to the Sunnah. No, definitely not. Rather we must consider the Qur’aan and the Sunnah as one source, there being no distinction between them at all. This is as has been indicated in the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, I was given the Qur’aan and something similar to it, along with it”</span></strong> – meaning the Sunnah – and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They will not be separated from one another until they return to the Fountain.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this dividing them into categories, mentioned in the hadeeth, is not correct, because it necessitates that they are separate from one another. And this is false, as I have explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] It is found under number 885 of Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah. We hope that the volume that includes it will be printed soon, in shaa Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is unfortunate that there can be found some contemporary tafseer writers and authors that have taken the view of making permissible what has been mentioned in the last two examples <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>[1]</strong></span> , such as the permissibility of eating predatory animals and wearing gold and silk, relying upon the Qur’aan (as proof) only! In fact, there can be found in this present time a group that call themselves the <strong>Qur’aaniyoon</strong>, who interpret the Qur’aan according to their desires and intellects, without seeking assistance for that in the authentic Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah, according to them, is subordinate to their desires. So whatever part of it conforms to their desires, they affirm it, and whatever doesn’t conform to their desires, they throw behind their backs (rejecting it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم indicated these individuals in an authentic hadeeth, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Do not let any one of you sit reclining on his couch, then when something that I have commanded him to do comes to him, he says: ‘I don’t know! Whatever we find in the Book of Allaah, we will follow it.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by At-Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“…’whatever we find in it that’s unlawful, we will declare unlawful.’ Indeed, I was sent with the Qur’aan and something equal to it along with it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, whatever the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم forbade is the same as what Allaah forbade.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is unfortunate is that one dignified author wrote a book on the Legislation and Creed of Islaam. He stated in his introduction that he wrote the book but he had no references in it except for the Qur’aan! So this authentic hadeeth provides clear proof that the Islamic Legislation is not based on the Qur’aan only, but rather it is based on the Qur’aan and Sunnah. So whoever takes hold of one in the absence of the other, doesn’t actually take hold of any of them. This is because each one of them commands that the other one be adhered to. This is as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whatever the Messenger gives you then do it, and whatever he forbids you from, then abstain from it.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with this ayah, I am amazed at what has been authentically reported from Ibn Mas’ood radhi Allaahu anhu, which is that a woman once came to him and said: “Are you the one who said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that puck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked and those who tattoo…’</span></strong> He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘I read the Qur’aan from its front to its back and I did not find in it that which you say!’ He responded: ‘If you had (truly) read it, you would have found it. Did you not read: ‘And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it (i.e. do it), and whatever he forbids you from, then stay away from?’ She said: ‘Of course!’ He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ‘Then I indeed heard The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that pluck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked…’”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan, and Examples for that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The male and the female thief – cut off their hands”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 38] is a good example of this, for the word <strong>“thief”</strong> mentioned in it, is absolute, as is the case with the word “hand.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah explains the first of these two (words) and restricts it to mean just the thief that steals a quarter of a dinaar. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no cutting off of the hand except in (cases where one steals) a quarter of a dinaar and more.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained the second (word) with his action or with the action of his Companions and his approving of that. This is since they would cut the hand of the thief off from the wrist, as is well known from the books of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah also explains the <strong>“hand”</strong> that is mentioned in the verse concerning Tayammum:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Then wipe your faces and hands”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 43, Surah Al-Maa’idah: 6] in that it can also refer to the palm.<span style="line-height:1.5;">This is based on the Prophet’s saying: </span><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#000000;"><strong>“Tayammum is a tap (i.e. wipe) of the face and hands.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others from the narration of ‘Ammaar bin Yaasir radhi Allaahu anhu] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some other verses from the Qur’aan that cannot be understood correctly, according to what Allaah intended, unless by way of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“It is those who believe and mix not their Faith with dhulm (wrong) – for them (only) there is security and they are the guided ones.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم understood the phrase <strong>“with dhulm (wrong)”</strong> according to its general sense, which includes every wrong, even if it be small. This is why they had difficulty understanding the verse and so they said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Which one of us doesn’t mix their Faith with wrong?” So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It doesn’t mean that. It only means Shirk (here). Didn’t you hear Luqmaan say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Verily Shirk is a great wrong?’</strong></span> [Surah Luqmaan: 13]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah’s says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten your prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The literal wording of this verse necessitates that shortening the prayer while on a journey can only be done on the condition when one is in the state of fear. This is why some of the Companions asked Allaah’s Messenger: “So then why do we shorten the prayer when we are in a state of security?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“This is a charity that Allaah has expended to you, so take His charity.”</strong> </span>[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the verbal Sunnah explains that deceased locusts and fish, as well as liver and spleen (types) of blood are lawful. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Two types of deceased animals and two types of blood have been made lawful for us: locusts and sea fish [meaning all types of fish], and the liver and the spleen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al- Bayhaqee and others in marfoo’ and mawqoof form. The chain of the mawqoof narration is authentic and it takes on the ruling of being marfoo’ since it cannot be stated based on one’s mere opinion.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering), or the flesh of swine (pork), for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allaah…’”</span></strong> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 145]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Sunnah came and forbade other things that haven’t been mentioned in this ayah, such as the Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Every predatory animal that has fangs and every bird that has claws is unlawful (for eating).”</span></strong> There are also other ahaadeeth on this subject that forbid other animals, such as what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said on the Day of Khaybar: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily Allaah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) domesticated donkeys, for they are impure.”</span></strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and the good (lawful) things from provision?’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Sunnah explains that there are certain types of adornments that are forbidden. It is authentically reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out one day to meet his Companions holding silk in one hand and gold in the other, and said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “These two things are unlawful for the males of my ummah, (but) lawful for the females.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Haakim who authenticated it] The ahaadeeth bearing this same understanding are many, well known and can be found in the two Saheeh collections as well as other collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many more examples like these (above) that are known to the people who have knowledge of Hadeeth and Fiqh. So from what has been stated previously, it should become clear to us, O brothers, the importance of the Sunnah in deriving Islamic laws. For indeed if we look back again at the examples I mentioned before, not to mention those that I didn’t mention, we will have certainty that there is no way to understand the noble Qur’aan, unless we understand it along with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first example,</strong> the Companions understood the word <strong>“dhulm”</strong> mentioned in the ayah according to its literal meaning. This was even though they, may Allaah be pleased with them, were as Ibn Mas’ood said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The best of this ummah, possessing the most pious of hearts, profound in learning and the least of constraints.”</strong></span> But in spite of this, they erred with regard to understanding that. So if it were not for the Prophet refuting their error and guiding them to what was correct with regard to the meaning of “dhulm” – that it in fact meant Shirk here – we would have followed them upon their error. However, Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, saved us from that due to the grace of the Prophet’s guidance and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the second example:</strong> if it weren’t for the afore-mentioned hadeeth, we would have remained in doubt, to say the least, regarding shortening the prayer while on a journey in the state of security. That is to say if we wouldn’t have already taken the view of making being in the state of fear a condition, as is literally stated in the ayah. This is also just what the Companions themselves understood (about the ayah) until they saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shorten his prayer, and they shortened their prayer along with him, while they were in a state of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the third example:</strong> If it weren’t for the hadeeth, we would have been forbidden from foods that were made lawful for us, such as (dead) locusts and fish, and liver and spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the fourth example</strong>, if it weren’t for the hadeeth, which mentions some things (not mentioned in the ayah), we would have made lawful what Allaah had made forbidden through the tongue of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, such as predatory (fanged) animals and birds with claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The same goes for the fifth example,</strong> if it weren’t for the ahaadeeth reported in that regard, we would have made lawful that which Allaah made unlawful upon the tongue of the Prophet, such as silk and gold. This is why some of the Salaf used to say: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Sunnah judges upon the Book (i.e. Qur’aan).”</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge of Arabic is not sufficient for understanding the Qur’aan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, it is obvious that <strong>whenever a person is knowledgeable of the Sunnah, he will be more likely to understand the Qur’aan and extract rulings from it, than someone who is ignorant about it</strong>. So how about the one who doesn’t rely on it or reference it at all? This is why from the principles that have been agreed upon by the people of knowledge is: to interpret the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah,1 and then the sayings of the Companions, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we become aware of the misguidance of the scholars of rhetoric, past and present, and their opposition to the Salaf, in their Creed, not to mention their rulings. And it is their remoteness from the Sunnah and their knowledge of it, and their making their intellects and desires as judges for themselves with regard to the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes. What is better than what has been stated in Sharh Al- ‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah [of Ibn Abil-‘Izz Al-Hanafee] (pg. 212, 4th Edition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“How can someone who didn’t learn from the Book and the Sunnah, but rather just learned it from the views of so and so, speak about the fundaments of the Religion! And if he claims that he is taking it from the Book of Allaah, then he is not taking the interpretation of the Book of Allaah from the ahaadeeth of the Messenger. He doesn’t look into it (i.e. the Sunnah), nor does he look at what the Companions or those who succeeded them in goodness said, which has been conveyed to us by way of reliable narrators chosen by the critics (i.e. hadeeth scholars). For indeed, they did not convey the arrangement of the Qur’aan only, but rather they conveyed the arrangement as well as the meanings. They would not learn the Qur’aan like the children do (today), rather they would learn it along with its meanings. And whoever does not follow their path, then he is speaking based on his opinion. And whoever speaks from his opinion, and from what he thinks Allaah’s Religion is, not getting that from the Book, he is in fact sinning (!), even if he may be correct. Whereas whoever takes from the Book and the Sunnah, he is rewarded even if he errs. However, if he is correct, his reward is multiplied.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said (pg. 217):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So it is an obligation to completely submit to the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, follow his orders, and meet his reports with acceptance and firm belief, without contradicting that by false notions that we consider “reasonable” or that constitute a misconception and doubt. Or that we put before it the views of men and the rubbish held in their minds. So we must single the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم out with regard to making him the judge, submitting to him, obeying him and complying with him, just as we single out the One who sent him in worship, humility, submissiveness, repentance and reliance (to Him).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In summary:</strong> It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم clearly stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have left two things for you, which you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allaah and my Sunnah. These two will never separate from one another until they return to the Fountain.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Maalik and Al-Haakim with a sound chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] We do not say as is the custom amongst many of the people of knowledge: <strong>“We interpret the Qur’aan by the Qur’aan if there is no trace of it in the Sunnah, then we interpret it by the Sunnah.”</strong> This is due to what we will explain later on in the end of this treatise, when speaking about the (weak) hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Definition of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the followers of <strong>Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong>. There are several points to be noted about their methodology, the most important of which are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They show a <strong>lack of importance to Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah</strong> [1], which is the most important matter in Islaam, since the Islaam of an individual is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They remain silent and concede to the people in their performance of major Shirk, supplication to other than Allaah, performance of tawaaf around graves, making oaths to the dead in the graves, sacrificing in their names and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this methodology was a <strong>Sufi</strong>. He had a connection with Sufism to the point that he gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Al-Khusaafee upon (following) his Khusaafee Shadh-lee order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The presence of innovations amongst them and their worshipping Allaah through them – even to the point that the founder of this methodology acknowledged that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would attend their gatherings of dhikr and that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would forgive what past sins they had committed, as is found in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“May Allaah bless the one who upon light in which he appeared<br />
To the worlds, and so he surpassed the sun and the moon<br />
This habeeb (i.e. Muhammad) along with his beloved has gathered<br />
And pardoned everyone in what sins they did in the past.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They call to <strong>establishing the Khilaafah</strong> and this is an innovation because the Messengers and their followers were not entrusted with anything except to call to Tawheed. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger, (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah and avoid the taaghoot (false deities).’”</b></span>[Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They have a <strong>lack of Walaa and Baraa</strong> (loyalty and disavowment) or a weak form of it. This is made clear in their call to bring closeness between the Sunnis and the Shee’ah. And their founder was quoted as saying: “We will cooperate with one another in what we agree on and pardon one another in what we disagree on.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <strong>They hate and despise the people of Tawheed</strong> and those who adhere to the Salafee Way. This is made clear in their talk concerning the Saudi state, which is founded upon Tawheed and which teaches Tawheed in its schools, institutes and universities. And it was made clear in their killing of Jameel Ar-Rahmaan Al-Afghaanee just because he called to Tawheed and because he had schools in which he would teach Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <strong>They pursue the mistakes of the leaders</strong> and expose their faults – whether true or false – spreading them amongst the youth in order to make the leaders appear hateful to them and so that they can fill their hearts with contempt against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. They hold detestable <strong>partisanship to the party</strong> they ascribe themselves to. So they show friendship based on this party and they show enmity based on this party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They give their <strong>oath of allegiance to work for the Ikhwaani Manhaj</strong> according to the ten conditions that the founder has set forth. And there are other issues of concern, which perhaps can be dealt with at a later time.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#808080;">Footnotes</span>:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This is the category of Tawheed related to the Oneness of Allaah in the worship that is performed to Him, i.e. that we worship only Allaah and no one else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to <strong>Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen</strong>. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong>They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger</strong>. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims – all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <strong>They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers.</strong> Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs</strong>. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>

&#8220;طاف خارِجِيّان بالبيت، فقال أحدُهما لصاحبه:</p>
<p>لا يدخلُ الجنة من هذا الخلق غيري وغيرُك!،</p>
<p>فقال له صاحبُه: جنةٌ عرضُها كعرض السماء والأرض.. بُنِيَت لي ولك؟! قال: نعم!! فقال: هي لك، وترك منهج الخوارج واهتدى&#8221; .<br />

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Foolishness of the Khawarij </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Abul-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqub bin al-Assm said :</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;Two of the khawarij were making Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and one of them said to his companion : </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;No one will enter Paradise from this creation except me and you!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">His companion said to him :</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;The span of Paradise will be like the span of the heavens and the earth, which has only been built for me and you?!!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">He said : &#8216;Yes!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">So he replied : &#8216;Then it is only for you!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">And he left the opinion of the khawarij and became guided. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 2&gt;Volume 2: `Aqidah&gt;The Sects&gt;Ahmad Deedat&#8217;s &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 19040</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Ahmad Deedat said in his book &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221; that Qur&#8217;an includes many references to the number 19 and its multiplications. He gave many examples and here are some of them: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;اسم&#8221; (name) is mentioned 19 times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الله&#8221; (Allah) is mentioned 2698 (19 x 142) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الرحيم&#8221; (The Most Merciful) is mentioned 114 (19 x 6) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The letter &#8220;ن&#8221; (Nun) is mentioned 133 (19 x 7) times in Surah Al-Qalam. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">He also made reference to the study conducted by Dr. Rashad Khalifah in his book &#8220;Al-Qur`an Taqdim Mar&#8217;y li-Mu`jizah&#8221;. Here are some examples of the points he raised: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Qur&#8217;anic revelation is composed of 19 words which include 76 (19 x 4) letters. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter) revealed in the Qur&#8217;an includes 19 Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and 285 (19 x 15) letters, etc. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) in this regard. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This study is among the fabricated falsities of a sect called Al-Batiniyyah Al-Baha&#8217;iyyah. It is based on glorifying the number 19. There is no doubt that this study is false, as it involves manipulating the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and distracting people from pondering  its true meanings.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li style="text-align:justify;">This malicious group holds many false beliefs such as some of its leaders claiming prophethood.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Its followers believe in <strong>Hulul</strong> (a Sufi term meaning indwelling) and <strong>Ittihad</strong> (a Sufi claim of union with Allah), </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">deem Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) to be unlawful and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">call for the unification of religions plus many other things.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">So, it is the duty of Muslims to beware of falling into this evil group and of being affected by its ideas or books. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">We ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to save us from their plotting and to protect Muslims from their evils, for He is All-Powerful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience due to anyone in disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 180 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience to mankind in disobedience to Allaah, indeed obedience is in goodness.</strong>&#8220;[Silsilah Saheehah: 181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The reason for this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched an army, and he commanded a man to lead them, who lit a fire, and the man said to the army: enter into the fire. The people wanted to enter into the fire, but some of them said : verily we have just fled from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he said to those who wanted to enter into it: if you entered it you would have remained in it until the Day of Judgment, and he said a good word to the others, and he said…..(the above hadeeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The extra wording in the hadeeth is from Tayyalisee and the context is by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by him where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched a battalion and ordered a man from the Ansaar to lead them, and he ordered them to listen to him and obey him. They caused this man to get angry, so he said to them: Gather some firewood for me, so they gathered it for him. Then he said: light the fire and they lit the fire, then he said to them: Did not the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – order you to listen and to obey me? They said Yes, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said &#8211; enter in to the fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they started to look at each other, and said (and in another narration: a young boy said to them) : indeed we fled to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from the fire, [ do not be hasty, until you meet the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and if he orders you to enter it, then enter into it ], so this is what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man&#8217;s anger came down/subsided, and the fire was put out. When they returned to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and mentioned it to him, he said: if you had entered it, you would never have exited from it, <strong>indeed obedience is in goodness</strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari (8/47, 13/109), Muslim (6/16), Ahmad (1/82, 134) and other narrations which contain the extra wording is also by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has many benefits, the most important of which is the impermissibility of obedience to anyone, if it is disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala, whether it is the leaders, scholars and the shaykhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this hadeeth you get to know the misguidance of different groups of people;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> some of the soofis who obey their shaykhs, even if they command them to commit sins, using as a proof, that they in reality are not committing sins. Also that the shaykh sees that which the follower does not see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know a shaykh from amongst these people who appointed himself as a leader. He mentioned a story to his followers in some of his lessons in the masjid, the summary of which is, one of the Soofi shaykhs ordered one of his followers that during the night he should go to his father and kill him while he is in his bed next to his wife! So when he killed him, he returned to the shaykh, happily having carried out the command of the shaykh! The shaykh looked at him and said: Do you think that you have really killed your father? Rather he is your mother&#8217;s boyfriend! As for your father he is away!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he makes and presents a Sharia&#8217; ruling, as he claims, from his story, and he says to his followers : If a shaykh orders his follower with a ruling which is apparently against the Sharia&#8217;, it is upon the followers to obey him in this, then he said: Do you not see this shaykh, he apparently orders the boy to kill his father, however in reality he ordered him to kill the one who fornicated with his mother, and that person deserved to be killed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The falsity of this story is not hidden according to the Sharia&#8217; from many angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: Carrying out the punishment is not the right of the shaykh, no matter how important he is; rather it is from the right of the leader or the one in charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong> </span>: if the case was that this actually took place, then why did he only carry out the punishment on the man and not the woman, and they both fornicated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: the Sharia&#8217; ruling for the married adulterer is to be stoned to death, and the person is not killed except by stoning. From this it is clear that the shaykh has opposed the Sharia&#8217; from many angles, this is also the situation with the follower who based upon this previous story, made it incumbent upon the Muslims to be obedient to the shaykh, to the extent one of them said to the people: if you see the shaykh and he is wearing a cross around his neck, then it is not allowed to criticize him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With all the clarity of the absurdity of these stories, and their opposition together to the Sharia&#8217; and to the intellect, we find some people become deceived by these stories, and amongst them some of the cultured youth. A discussion took place between me and one of those youths about that story, and he had heard it from that follower of the shaykh, and what the shaykh had based his ruling upon. However, the discussion with him did not bring about any benefit. He persisted in believing this story, since according to his claim, it was a miracle, and he added: you people reject miracles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I said to him: If your shaykh orders you to kill your father, would you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Indeed, I have not reached that level yet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after this can anyone be blamed for characterizing the religion of these shaykhs except that they are the opium of the people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second group is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blind followers who prefer to follow the statements of the Madhab above the statement of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam with what is clearly taken from the statements of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. So if it is said to one of them, for example: <strong>do not pray the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer after the obligatory prayer has begun</strong>, due to the prohibition of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from doing so, which is clear, they do not obey, and they say the Madhab allows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said to them: <strong>the Nikah at-Tahleel</strong> ( whereby another man marries the divorced woman and then divorces so that she can be allowed to marry her first husband) is invalid, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – cursed the one who does this. They would answer by saying: No, but it is permissible according to such and such Madhab!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are hundreds of issues like this, and this is why many of the scholars held the opinion that the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala about the Christians: &lt;&lt; <strong>They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah</strong> &gt;&gt; applies to these blind followers, as Fahkr ar-Razi has explained in his Tafseer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Daesh (in Arabic) are the initials for &#8216;Dawla al-Iraq wa Shaam al-Islaami. [Islamic state of Iraq and Shaam(1) &amp; in English termed as ISIS (2)] (3)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They do not know anything of Islaam except for the word &#8216;Islaam&#8217;, they are the most ignorant about Islaam.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This misguided sect came from the Khawarij [4] al-Qa&#8217;ida movement, the grandchildren of Abdurahman bin Muljam. [The evil dog who assassinated Ali RadhiAllaahu anhu]</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The al-Qa&#8217;ida movement was the mother whilst Daesh and Jabha an-Nusrah are the children.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The children (ISIS) have begun making Takfeer [5] of each other and killing each other as was the condition of their forefathers , the Najdaat and the Azaariqa who made Takfeer of each other and killed each other.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">So the children (ISIS) repeated the history of their fathers in making Takfeer, treachery and cheating. Moreover the children &#8211; meaning Daesh &#8211; have even more extreme exaggeration than their forefathers.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Khawarij of old used to make Takfeer of those who committed major sins. As for Daesh and those similar to them make Takfeer of both, those who commit major and minor sins!!!</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">When they make Takfeer of one of the Muslims <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> they &#8216;declare his blood, wealth and honour lawfully to be taken.&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I have been informed from the trustworthy people of Shaam</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That if Daesh make Takfeer of someone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; they carry out capital punishment for apostasy by being shot to death.<br />
&#8211; they take his wealth as spoils of war for the stockpile reserves for the Muslims.<br />
&#8211; they take the women folk of Shaam as slaves and they carry out lewd acts on them, with the argument that these women are what the right hand possess.<br />
&#8211; it has also been affirmed that they carry out pedophilia with the children of the Muslims and refuge with Allaah is sought.</p>
<p>they are filthier than the Jews and Christians and more defiled than the saliva of dogs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khawarij swear allegiance with the Shia against the people of Sunnah</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; when the Khawarij rebelled against the rightly guided Khalifa Uthmaan bin Affan &#8211; RadhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; there was with them Abdullaah bin Saba a senior from the Shia and along with some of those people who came from the land of Yemen, they entered along with the Khawarij and killed Uthmaan -RadhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Today this is Daesh which takes oaths of allegiance with the Shia Nusayreeya</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; they fight against the people of Sunnah in the land of Shaam; they have no mercy upon the young, or old, or those of intellect, nor the insane, or a woman or a baby.<br />
&#8211; they display the dead bodies of the Muslims and set fire to them.<br />
&#8211; the Hadeeth mentions: &#8216;The Prophet &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; prohibited mutilation and displaying the dead body.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; it is affirmed from the Messenger &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam:<br />
ً أوصاه بتقوى الله وقال لھم اغزوا ولا تغدروا ولا تمثلوا ولا تقتلوا امرأة )<br />
أنھ إذا أمر أمیرا<br />
ً<br />
ً ولا صبیا<br />
(&#8230;ولا شیخا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When he would appoint a leader, he would advise him with having Taqwa of Allaah. He would say to them go to battle, do not be treacherous, do not mutilate and display the body, do not kill a woman, old person nor a child.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khawarij hate the leaders of the Muslims and they make Takfeer of them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the Khawarij were not pleased with the authority of the Amir al &#8211; Mumineen Ali bin Abi Talib -RadhiAllaahu anhu.<br />
&#8211; they broke their oath of allegiance. . . and they made Takfeer of him and those who were with him. . . .<br />
&#8211; they waged war against him and they killed him treacherously when he came out to pray the Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> This is Daesh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; &#8216;they make Takfeer of the rulers of the Muslims.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;they make their blood lawful to take.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;rather they make Takfeer of everyone who opposes them from the Muslims.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; &#8216;they wish to remove the Islaamic countries, because they do not view them as Islaamic countries, rather they view them as countries of disbelief. This was the &#8216;Aqeedah of the destructive Sayed Qutb, a leader of the Takfeeris (those who excommunicate Muslims) of the modern times.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"> The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; said:<br />
(یقتلون أھل الإسلام ویتركون أھل الأوثان)<br />
&#8216;They kill the people of Islaam and leave off the people who worship idols.&#8217;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The forces of Daesh try to wipe out the Muslims in the country of Shaam whilst the Muslims say La ilaha illa Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Just like the forefathers of Daesh did so when they killed the Muslims in Basara; they killed Abdullaah bin Khabbab bin al-Araat [6] and threw him in a river. Then they cut open his wife&#8217;s belly and took out the baby and threw him in the river as well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They would cut off the highways in Basra, kill the Muslim and let go the Christian.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; alayhi salat wa sallam &#8211; said :<br />
(لزوال الدنیا أھون عند الله من قتل مسلم بغیر حق)<br />
&#8216;The whole of the Dunyaa being destroyed is lesser to Allaah than unlawfully killing a Muslim.&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Daesh forces:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">○ The Daesh forces consist of a number of nationalities from different countries, from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the people of Morocco, they are the extremist of the people in excessively making Takfeer.<br />
&#8211; the people from Iraq and they are those who carry out killings, looting, plundering and crucifixion.<br />
&#8211; those from the people of the Arabian Gulf carry out suicide operations.<br />
&#8211; those from Chechneya are war commanders in Daesh.<br />
&#8211; those from the people of Sham from the Baith party are spies and traitors. They inform Daesh of the homes of Syrians so they can kill them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is some of what I have heard about this misguided sect, dogs of the Hell fire. I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to hasten their destruction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The description of the Khawarij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Zaid bin Wahb al-Juhani who reported: That he was amongst the army which was with Ali -Radhi Allaahu anhu and which went out against the Khawarij. Ali -Radhi Allaahu anhu- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‹O people, indeed I heard the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur’aan, and your recital would seem insignificant compared with their recital, as would your prayer as compared with their prayer, and your fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur’aan thinking that it supports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their throats..[Bukhari]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Scholar: ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
Reference: Darulhadith, Sweden<br />
Translation &amp; Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who incite the youths and say that our brothers are dying everywhere. They call in the name of Jihâd and that one shouldn&#8217;t obey the ruler in this (I.e. in Jihâd). Can you say something regarding this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: Shall we then also kill our own children, tear our homes apart and kill the Muslims if our brothers die everywhere? They rejoice in this. They rejoice in getting our brothers into these countries. They rejoice over these homicide-attacks in our countries. Is this Jihâd? Does this affect our enemies? It only affects us. It only affects the Muslims.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Soofis like to link the name to <strong>Ahlus-Suffah</strong> (people of As-Suffah) who were at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that there are great resemblances between the Soofee adept and Ahlu-Suffa. Those were poor people from the Muhaajireen who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah fleeing the persecution of the pagan Arabs. They were driven away from their homes and had neither money nor families, nor a place to stay. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) assisted them and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) allowed them to stay in a courtyard by his Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact, however, is that those poor Muslims resorted to the Mosque <strong>out of necessity</strong>. Their numbers increased at certain times and decreased at other times. Some of them stayed longer than others. So they were not a specific group united on something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soofism in its early stages stressed the concepts of <strong>detachment from the worldly life, poverty, isolation</strong>, etc. <span style="color:#993300;">The people of As-Suffah did not choose such concepts</span>. They were in need and the Muslims helped them. They did not isolate themselves. In fact, they <strong>engaged in Jihaad</strong> whenever it was announced. When Allaah, the Most High, bestowed from His bounties upon the Muslims, <strong>some of them became free of want and were among the richest of the Sahaabah</strong> and others became <strong>leaders in some Muslim lands</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Soofis would like to establish a linkage with the Prophet’s era and claim as well that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) approved the early seed of Soofism exemplified in Ahlus-Suffah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, and from a linguistic point of view, to derive Soofism from As-Suffah is wrong, because the correct term would be <strong>Suffism</strong> and not Soofism</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim believes that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and the last Prophet. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last of the Prophets</span>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah entrusted Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with the final and complete message of Islam, calling mankind to worship none but Allaah. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the best of the Messengers and the best of mankind. He, has no share at all of Ruboobiyyah (lordship) nor any share of Divinity. Contemplate the saying of Allaah regarding Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say, O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not within my power to bring benefit nor to keep away harm except as Allaah wills; and if I knew what the future holds I could amass a great deal of wealth and harm would not befall me. But I am just a Messenger from Allaah sent by Him to warn those who disobey Him of His punishment, and to give glad tidings of His reward fro those who truly believe in Him and are obedient to Him.</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf, 7:188].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I am just a human like yourselves, I forget just as you forget. So, if I forget, then remind me.</span>” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The belief that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah necessitates that</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the true Messenger of Allaah; he did not lie nor was he belied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The Muslim should follow his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-The Muslim believes in all of the reports which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) related regarding the past, present and future and that these reports were revealed to him by Allaah (Azza wa Jal) and was not something which he knew on his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4-We comply with his commands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5-We stay away from what he forbade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-We defend the Sharee’ah with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7-We comply with all that the he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought from the Sharee’ah as if it were from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In the sight of the mystic Soofis,</strong></span> the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is looked upon in ways that oppose the path which Allaah (Azza wa Jal) intended for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be summarized in the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Many Soofis stress the concept of what they call <strong>Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong> or the <strong>“Perfect Man” (Al- Insaan Al-Kaamil)</strong>. In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation. And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “Perfect Man” or the “Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al-Jeeli (d.820Hj/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. [29] In this book he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, may Allaah guard and protect you, that Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man) is the Qutub (the axis) around which the spheres of existence from beginning to end revolves. And he is one since the being of existence and forever and ever. Furthermore, he takes on various forms and appears in churches&#8230;his original name which belongs to him is Muhammad&#8230;I met him while he was in the image of my sheikh Sharaf-ud-Deen Ismaa’eel Al- Jhubratee&#8230;the secret behind this matter is him being able to take the form of every image&#8230;” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the same creed of Ibn ‘Arabi and the advocates of <strong>Wahdat Al-Wujud</strong>, those who claim that Allaah is the essence of all that exits. They consider the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as the first created being and from him originated rest of creation and that he himself is the God who is above the Throne. Such concept is similar to the philosophical concept of the “<strong>first cause</strong>” or the “<strong>first active intellect</strong>” from whom the creation emanated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-Some Soofis hold to the same concept as above but do not say that the essence of Muhammad is above the ‘Arsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-Many Soofis claim that <strong>the light of Muhammad</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the first being, and that he is the most honorable of creation, and for his sake Allaah has created the universe. They do not explicitly say that the creatures originated from him. [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most Soofis, however, concur that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the <strong>essence of emanation of all knowledge</strong>. Some of them consider that this emanation is eternal, meaning that it is present even before the existence of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). That is why a large sector of the Soofis believe that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) <strong>knows the Ghayb</strong> and that nothing escapes his knowledge in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have also innovated many practices aimed at showing their so-called love of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) including <strong>celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday</strong> and his journey of <strong>Israa’ and Mi’raaj</strong>, his <strong>Hadrah</strong>, [32] and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They even <strong>call upon the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) seeking aid and help believing that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) responds and answers such Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such concepts, beliefs, and practices concerning the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) are corrupt and contradict the Message of the Qur’aan and Sunnah as well as the way of the true believers, the Sahaabah and those who followed them on the path of righteousness, may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Part-Concepts and Practices of Soofism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(A) In Reference to Tawheed of Allaah, the Most High.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed) means to single out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of affairs, with all worship, and with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself or upon the tongue of His Messenger and as they befit His Magnificence. The proof of this is in many texts from the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. One of them is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">[Allaah is] the Rabb of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, Ar-Rahmaan (the one whose Mercy encompasses everything), so worship him alone and be patient and firm on his worship, do you know of any who is similar to Him?</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam, 19:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Tawheed centers upon three types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-<strong>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Tawheed of Lordship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of Affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-<strong>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Tawheed of Worship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with all worship such that no kind of worship could be offered to anyone or anything besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-<strong>Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat:</strong> Singling out Allaah with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself in His Book, or upon the tongue of His Messenger. So the believer affirms what Allaah has affirmed for Himself, and denying whatever He has denied from Himself, without Tahreef (changing and distorting their meanings), without Ta’teel (denying or divesting Allaah of His Attributes), without Takyeef (describing how they are), and without Tamtheel (likening them to those of His creation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">This true belief in Tawheed is not the “Tawheed” of the foremost Soofis. Their Tawheed reflects different creeds and is considered by many as “hidden knowledge” which may be only attained by the elite:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>01 &#8211; Al-Hulool:[13] In mystic Soofism it refers to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Divine incarnation</span> in the so-called Soofee saints.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn Taymeeyah classified the <strong>Hulool</strong> into two kinds. The first is the specific hulool like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eessa (alayhi assaalm) and like that of the extremist Shee’ah and Soofee mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (radhi Allahu anhu) and in special Soofee saints, respectively. The second kind is the general Hulool and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [14] <span id="more-34648"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the most daring Soofis who held to the concept of incarnation was <strong>Al-Hallaaj</strong> [15] who was tried for his heresy and put to death by the ‘Abbaasid authorities. Ibn ‘Ajeebah (1224 AH/1809 C.E.), one of the leading Soofis who explained the Hikam of the mystic Ibn ‘Ataa (d. 709AH/1309 C.E.) related that Al-Hallaj said: “<em>I am You without doubt Subhaanak is Subhaanee. Your Tawheed is my Tawheed and disobeying You is disobeying me. Glorified be He whom his Naassoot (creation, human qualities) made manifest the secret of His shining and piercing Laahoot (the Divine)</em>.[16] He then appeared in His creation manifested in the image of the one who eats and drinks. Even His creation was able to see Him with their own eyes like the moment an eyebrow sees an eyebrow [emphasizing certitude].” [17] Ibn ‘Ajeebah added, “And because of the unraveling of such matters and other similar ones, Al-Hallaaj, may Allaah be pleased with him! -was killed.”[18] These matters according to Ibn ‘Ajeebah and other mystics should not be disclosed. They are the secrets of their Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>02 &#8211; Some see Allaah as the only existing being. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is stressed by <strong>Al-Ghazaalee</strong>, may Allaah forgive him, in his book <strong>Ihyaa ‘Ulum ad-Deen</strong>. He said: “<em>Anyone who does not see Allaah in everything, then he sees ‘other’ than Him,</em>” and that “<em>The pure Tawheed is to see in everything nothing but Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala.</em>” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of such “Tawheed” is that there is one existing being and that is Allaah. The one who sees an existence other than that of Allaah is the Mushrik (who commits Shirk). Al-Ghazaalee explained the perfect understanding of la ilaaha illa Allaah as: “To see none except the One, the Truth,&#8221; and that this represents the “perfect state of Tawheed!” He referred to a state of “Tawheed,” “witnessed by the sincere ones and which the Soofis call Al-Fanaa’ (annihilation) in Tawheed” as the one in which, “Only One (i.e. Allaah) is seen in the entire existence.” Al- Ghazaalee stresses that the utmost objective of Tawheed is to see, “Al-Kull (everything) not as Katheer (many), but as one,” and that this “represents the objective of the (Soofee) knowledge known as Kashf,” and that, “The secrets of this knowledge should not be recorded in a book.” He defined the Mushrik as the one, “Who affirms the existence of ‘an existence’ besides that of Allaah” and that Allaah is, “The witness and the Witnessed, the one loving dearly and the Beloved, and He is the Shaakir (the one who is thankful) and the Mashkoor (The One Who deserves acknowledgment and recognition)…”[20] This is not true Tawheed in which the believer knows well that Allaah is distinct and separate from His creation, rather this is “Wahdah” (unity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Doctrine of Wahdat Al-Wujud.</strong></span> This is neither <strong>Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in creation) nor <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created), rather it means that every creature that the eye sees is Allaah in essence. This concept of the Unity of Existence is held by many of the so-called Soofee saints (Awliyaa’) like Ibn Al-Faarid (d. 632AH/1235 C.E.), Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 638AH/1240 C.E.), Ibn ‘Sab’een (d. 669 AH/1270 C.E.), Al-‘Afeef At-Tilmisaani (d. 690 AH/1291C.E.), Ibn Masheesh (d. 622 AH/1225 C.E.), An- Nabulusi (d. 1143 AH/1731 C.E.), and others. Under such concept, the presence of creation is an illusion or an imagination. Many Soofis consider Ibn ‘Arabi the Greatest sheikh and the symbol of the concept of Wahdat Al-Wujud. He considers the Soofee who knows of Allaah (‘Aarif billaah) as the one who “Sees Allaah in everything, rather he sees Him the essence of Everything,” [21] and that “He (Allaah) is the Essence of Existence” [22] Ibn ‘Arabi considered all kinds creeds to be true and he believed in them all. This is his “Unity of Worship”: Creatures have held [certain] tenets regarding the Ilaah And I have believed in all of what they have believed in.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “Be careful not to restrict yourself to a particular (or distinct) creed and deny everything else otherwise you would miss a great deal of good. Rather you would miss knowing the matter as it is. So, be within yourself an HexhqKy (Hayouli: A substance) for all the forms of creeds, for Allaah is Greater than being limited by one creed and excluding another.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ibn ‘Arabi contain many statements in which he considers everything worshipped on earth is Allaah [25] and that his heart “turned to accept every image”; it became “a monastery for monks, a home for idols, the Ka’bah of the Taa’if (the one in Tawaaf), the Tablets of the Torah, and the book of the Qur’aan&#8230;” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is only a very brief presentation on the position of mystic Soofism regarding the belief in Allaah Who is High above what they attribute to Him. Imaam Ath-Thahabee rahimahullah said regarding the book of Fusoos Al-Hikam of Ibn ‘Arabi: “If there is no Kufr in it [Fusoos], then there is no Kufr in this world!” [27]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Second Part: When Did It All Start? [9]<br />
<strong>The Beginning and Development of Soofism</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Innovations usually start small then grow big</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars traced the seeds of Soofism to the early stages of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>second Century of the Hijri calendar</strong></span>, while others pointed out that the early features of it began before the year 200 After Hijrah (AH).10 The early deviation was exemplified in <strong>exaggerations in worship</strong> and <strong>extremism in avoidance of the worldly life</strong>. In the beginning, some people became interested in leading a pious life of Zuhd (an abstemious way of life), patience, clemency, sincerity, truthfulness, although some of them exaggerated and (or) introduced innovated forms of worship and innovated concepts. Then those who attached themselves to such practices became lax in allowing <strong>singing and dancing</strong>, something which they refer to as <strong>Samaa’</strong> [singing aimed at stimulating a state of <strong>Wajd (ecstasy)</strong> and excessive worship.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As, with every Bid’ah, Iblees beautifies it in the eyes of its beholder and drives him to do more Bida’. The Soofism is just one case of Talbees Iblees (A devil’s deception), whereby he turned them away from knowledge and showed them that what matters is action. Though many of them may have started with good intentions, nevertheless they took off from the course of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During of the third century</strong></span>, introduction of new concepts and practices became more evident. Some became interested in <strong>monasticism (living like monks)</strong>, while others spoke of <strong>poverty, hunger, sleeplessness, wonderment, seclusions, dancing, clamping, innovated forms of Thikr</strong>, etc. Many <strong>abandoned marriage and the seeking of means of sustenance</strong>. Others exaggerated in disassociating themselves from Hadeeth and its knowledge. In the course of this development, the masters would put certain regulations that made them see themselves as the “special” who have “special inward knowledge” that takes the person directly to Allaah. They referred to this state as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-&#8216;Ilm Al-Baatin (special &#8220;inward&#8221; knowledge)</strong></span>. Such baseless classifications marked the beginning of the introduction of the so-called <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;knowledge of Al-Haqeeqah (lit. Reality)</span></strong>, in reference to the so-called &#8220;<strong>mystic knowledge</strong>&#8221; of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>By the end of this century</strong></span>, Soofism spread and Soofee orders began to sprout and some of its deviant creeds like <strong>Al- Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in incarnation), <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created) were adopted by some of their extreme masters. New states of Soofism were defined and the masters spoke of specific terminology defining such states, like <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Fanaa</strong></span>’ (annihilation), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thawq</strong> </span>(experience), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kashf</strong> </span>(perception and witnessing all of the realities of existence as well as those of the unseen), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wajd</strong> </span>(ecstasy), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Samaa</strong></span>&#8216; (mystic singing and dancing as a means of inspiration), and other philosophical terms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During the 4th century</strong></span>, Soofism was almost transformed into orders accommodating all sorts of Bida’ in ‘Aqeedah (creed) and Ittibaa&#8217; (way of following). It was a blend for every sect. Amongst them you find the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’atazilite, the Maatureedi, the Ash’aree, the Shee’iee, the philosopher, the Murj’i, the Jabri, and followers of all sorts of Ahwaa’(desires and innovations). For Ahlul Ahwaa&#8217; (followers of lowly desirers and innovations), Soofism became a universal ground which they penetrate in the name of spiritual guidance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During the sixth century</strong></span>, a group of mystic Soofis claimed to be descendents of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and each one of them established for himself a special Soofee order with special followers. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ar-Rifaa’i</strong></span> appeared in ‘Iraaq, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Badawi</strong></span> and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ash-Shaathili</strong></span> in Egypt. These orders branched into other orders. In this century and in the next two, the Soofee Fitnah reached its climax with the ‘Aqeedah of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wahdat Al-Wujood</strong></span> (Unity of Existence), appearance of new Bida’ (building on graves and magnifying them, innovated celebrations, etc.), more Soofee orders and more superstitions. This was supported by the establishment in Egypt of the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Ubaydiiyyah State</strong></span> (known as the <strong>Fatimid State</strong>), which spread its influence over many Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, during the latter centuries, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, the Soofee orders reached the thousands and the Soofee practices and affiliation spread over the entire Muslim world. Today, Soofism has establishments, preachers, funding, and almost unrestricted movement of its people across the borders of many Muslim and non-Muslim countries. As to its most important objectives, I leave it to a Soofee enthusiast well known in the circles of Soofism, Saayed Hossein Nasr, who stated that, “All that we can do is to stress that the Soofee teachings center upon two fundamental creeds: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wahdat Al-Wujood</strong></span>, and <strong>Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man)</strong>. [11] [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During all of this past of Soofism and nowadays, Soofism was not left without challenge. The Salaf gave their advice and warned against the early deviations and mistakes of some the early Soofis. They exposed the false concepts of beliefs and practices of Soofism in the past and in the present. This, by Allaah’s Grace, benefited and continues to benefit the Muslims worldwide. The truth propagated by the followers of the Salaf is finding its way everywhere despite the efforts by its opponents who try to disseminate among the people it causes rifts between the Muslims while they represent &#8220;the way of unity&#8221; through their so-called Mainstream Islam. The Path of the Salaf distinguishes between the truth and falsehood and calls to unite the Muslims on the true <strong>Tawheed</strong> and pure <strong>Ittibaa</strong>’ (following of the established Sharee&#8217;ah). This makes it binding that the followers of the Salaf should be a good example and use wisdom and kindness in their efforts to propagate the truth without compromising the principles of the Deen. Errors by some of the followers of the Salaf should not hinder the truth seeker from accepting the truth regarding matters of the Deen, and he should judge according to the principle not the mistakes of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] References: Ibn Al-Jawzee’s Talbees Iblees, pp. 156-165, Ibn Taymeeyah’s Majmoo’ Al-Fataawaa, vol. 10, pp: 366-367, Saadiq Saadiq’s Masaadir At-Talaqee, pp. 38-35; and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Ibn Taymeeyah holds the first while Ibnul Jawzee and Ibn Khaldoon are of the second opinion (See Talbees Ibleess, p. 201 and Al- Muqaddimah, p. 467, respectively).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil</strong></span>: In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation (or man). And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “<strong>Perfect Man</strong>” or the “<strong>Al-Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong>”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!! <em>This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al- Jeeli (d.820 AH/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. See V. 2, p. 73 (4th edition), 1395 AH/1975 C.E.. See also Mu’jam Al-Mustalahaat As-Soofeeyyah by ‘Abdul Mun’im Al-Hafnee, p. 27. Also refer to Mu’jam Al- Mustalahaat As-Soofeeyyah by Anwar Fouad Abee Al-Khazzaam, p. 49, published by Maktabat Lubnaan, Beirut, Lebanon, 1993. Al-Jeeli’s book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is filled with plain statements of Kufr. Just consider his belief regarding the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) (above). </em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They have a weakness when it comes to understanding the Religion of Allaah. This is why it has been reported that &#8220;They recite the Qur&#8217;aan but it does not surpass&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2456)] &#8220;&#8230;or go past their throats.&#8221; [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will make their tongues eloquent with the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 937) from Abu Bakrah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, he صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;They will call to the Book of Allaah, but they will have nothing to do with Allaah.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 941) from Abu Zaid Al-Ansaaree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, the Khawaarij and what they undergo when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan was mentioned to Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu), so he said: &#8220;They are not as extreme in their striving as the Jews and the Christians were, but yet they went astray.&#8221; [Ash- Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 27-28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;They believe in His clear verses, but go astray concerning His unclear verses 10 &#8211; No one knows their hidden meanings except Allaah. And as for those firmly rooted in knowledge, they say: &#8216;We believe in it.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8220;They are in a confused and drunken state. They are neither Jews nor Christians nor Magians, so that they may be excused.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventh Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are excessive in performing acts of worship, as occurs in the hadeeth in which the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم spoke to his Companions about them, saying: &#8220;Your prayer is nothing as compared to their prayer.

And your reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is nothing as compared to their reciting.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration of this hadeeth, it states: &#8220;You will look down at your prayer as compared to their prayer&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;&#8230;(and you will look down) at your deeds as compared to their deeds.&#8221; [Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1231)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are the worst of creation and creatures. [Muslim (no. 2469) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The Khawaarij are an evil people. I don&#8217;t know of any people on the earth that are worse than them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Abu Bakr Al-Khallaal (no. 110)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Characteristic:</span></strong> Their distinguishing attribute is that they shave their heads. [Muslim (no. 2457) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, it states: &#8220;At-Tasbeet.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 4765) from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tasbeet means: Removing the short hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Tenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will kill the people of Faith and leave alone the worshippers of idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;They will kill the people of Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2451) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eleventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They will become so deeply absorbed (i.e. ta&#8217;ammuq) in the Religion [11] to the point that they will leave from it. [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 930) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not believe that the people of knowledge and virtue hold a special position. This was why they perceived that they were more knowledgeable than &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il- Islaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. 13 [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.&#8221; [Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/240)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-34135"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu) held them to be the worst of creation. He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said about them: &#8220;They took ayaat that were revealed concerning the disbelievers and applied them to the believers.&#8221; Al-Bukhaaree reported this narration under the &#8220;Chapter: Killing the Khawaarij and Heretics after establishing the proof against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &#8220;And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should be avoiding.&#8221; [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Twentieth Characteristic:</span></strong> There is a great reward for he who kills them. &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;If the army that encounters them knew what was ordained for them upon the tongue of their prophet, they would only rely on that action.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4768)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it reads: &#8220;Whoever fights them has more right to Allaah than them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They are the worst of those who are killed under the surface of the sky. And the best of those who are killed is he who is killed at their hands.&#8221; And (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;These individuals were Muslims but became disbelievers.&#8221; [Ibn Maajah (no. 176)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They shed unlawful blood &#8211; whether their own by way of suicide or others by transgressing against them by way of murder. [Muslim (no. 246) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> As &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They will speak the truth with their tongues, but it will not go past this from them.&#8221; &#8211; And he pointed to his throat. &#8220;They are from the most despised of Allaah&#8217;s creation to Him.&#8221; He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said this when they told him: &#8220;There is no rule except for that of Allaah&#8217;s.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2468) from the statement of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the first ones who split away from the unified body of Muslims and declared them to be disbelievers due to (their committing of) sins. [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa of Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (3/349 and 7/279)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They beautify their speech but produce vile actions &#8211; after mentioning the differing and division in the ummah. [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> Every time a new generation springs forth from them, it gets cut off (i.e. from the Jamaa&#8217;ah). [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> There will emerge from amidst them the Dajjaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration it states: &#8220;&#8230;from their treachery&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one manuscript: &#8220;&#8230;from their ranks&#8230;&#8221; And that refers to a great army. [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

[Ahmad (no. 22313) from Abu Umaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever due to every sin. And they say: &#8220;The leave the fold of Eemaan and enter into disbelief.&#8221; [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 298) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They hold that the Muslims who commit major sins will reside eternally in the Hellfire. [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 360) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>

This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/126)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare those who don&#8217;t agree with their views to be disbelievers, and they consider their blood lawful for shedding. The also permit the killing of the women and children that oppose them. This is done by the Azaariqah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that Faith (Eemaan) is: Knowledge of Allaah and of what the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم came with. So whoever commits something that he is not sure of as to whether it is lawful or unlawful, he is a disbeliever, since he was obligated to have researched into the matter. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/87)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that it is obligatory to fight against the ruler alone as well as whoever is pleased with his rule. As for those who reject the ruler, then it is not permissible to fight against them unless they support the ruler, attack the beliefs of the Khawaarij or serve as guides for the ruler. 15 This is done by the &#8216;Ujaaradah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They say: &#8220;Every sin that a person commits makes him a disbeliever, since he is ignorant of Allaah.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> There will be from among them those who will be with the Dajjaal during the Last Days. It was said to &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu: &#8220;All praise be to Allaah who rescued the servants from them.&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Nay. I swear by the One in whose Hand my soul is, there are still some of them that remain in the loins of men and verily, there are those amongst them who will be with the Dajjaal.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fortieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They cling onto the apparent meanings of the Qur&#8217;aanic texts. Even though they don&#8217;t intend to oppose it, however, they understand from it that which the texts do not indicate. Due to this, they have claimed that the prophets committed major and minor sins based on Allaah&#8217;s statement: &#8220;Verily, We have given you a manifest victory &#8211; So that Allaah may forgive you of your past and future sins.&#8221; [Surah Al-Fat&#8217;h: 1-2] So according to them, the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم may commit disbelief then repent.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They reject the Sunnah if there is not some explicit text in the Qur&#8217;aan that supports it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;They do not take anything from the Sunnah except for that which can be interpreted in its general sense, not including those texts that contradict what is apparently stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, according to them. So they do not believe in stoning the fornicator nor do they believe that there is a minimum (stolen) amount, which constitutes stealing.&#8221; [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa (13/48)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They lie in wait on the roads for the purpose of attacking the passers-by and spilling their blood without any justification from Allaah. [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/153) and Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/236) from the speech of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> Not one of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم could be found amongst them (i.e. to support them). [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/150)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> There are many amongst them that differ with one another. This is why they have divided into so many sects, some of which set out to fight against the other and at times, some of which deliver speeches against the other. Allaah spoke truthfully when He said: &#8220;If it (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) were from other than Allaah, you would have found many differences in it.&#8221; [Surah An-Nisaa: 82] [Al- Khawaarij- Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> They outwardly manifest the attributes of calling to good and forbidding evil, redirecting the religious texts concerning that towards disputing with the rulers, rebelling against them and fighting against those who oppose them. [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 22) and Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (P9- 37)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They speak using the speech and words of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin al-Husayn (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;It is not befitting for one who sees the tireless efforts of a Khaarijee that has rebelled against a ruler &#8211; whether just or tyrannical &#8211; thus setting out against him, rallying a group against him, unsheathing swords and deeming it lawful to fight against Muslims &#8211; it is not befitting for him to be deceived by such a person&#8217;s recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan nor by the length of his standing in prayer, nor by his perseverance in fasting, nor by his good words concerning knowledge, so long as he holds the views of the Khawaarij.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They use as evidence verses from the Qur&#8217;aan that deal with the wa&#8217;eed (Allaah&#8217;s threat of punishment) while abandoning the verses concerning the wa&#8217;ad (Allaah&#8217;s promise for forgiveness).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who has doubts concerning the well-established historical events. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 133)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to illiteracy and they make war against education, claiming that it is not possible to combine between the religious sciences and the practical secular sciences. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 134)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to splitting away from the Muslim community. So they boycott the schools, institutes, universities, government positions and residing with Muslims. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 137)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> From among them is he who believes that a person who holds that the consensus (Ijmaa&#8217;) of the scholars is proof is a disbeliever. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 143)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who disparages the Companions and rejects their statements. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 144)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They oppose those scholars that make blind- following permissible for the common person and the beginner student, claiming that blind-following (taqleed) is a cause for disbelief and the destruction of the nation of Islaam. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 146-147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They kill themselves in suicide operations basing that on false arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] This is a characteristic that is common with all innovators, since they go astray with regard to Allaah&#8217;s unclear verses. They do not try to combine between the clear and unclear verses, as those firmly-grounded in knowledge do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Meaning: They will seek to use evidences from the Book of Allaah but err in their manner of deriving the basis of proof from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Being amazed with oneself is one of the causes that lead the people of innovation astray. And it is one of the pathways that the Devil uses to enter into the affairs of worshippers, Mujaahideen and ascetics, so long as they do not adhere to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] I say: This is with respect to the later ones among them. As for the initial Khawaarij, then they rarely performed analytical deduction. Rather, they would apply their poor understanding to the religious texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] How similar does tonight resemble last night, for everyone that warns against their ways is accused (by them) as regards his Religion. They deem it permissible to fight against the police and security officers who are the cause for maintaining peace and safety.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: <strong><a title="Permanent Link to Sufism : Origin and Development  – Dr. Saleh As-Saleh" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/04/12/sufism-origin-and-development-dr-saleh-as-saleh/" rel="bookmark">Sufism : Origin and Development </a>– Dr. Saleh As-Saleh</strong> (e-Book)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call for Zuhd in Islam is to lead a pious life devoted to Allaah (Azza wa Jal) taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc. nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment [by wearing your clean clothes] while praying and going round [the Tawaaf of] the Ka’bah, and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He [Allaah] likes not the extravagants.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “Who has forbidden the adoration with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal things] of food?” Say: “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, [and] exclusively for them [believers] on the Day of Resurrection [the disbelievers will not share them].” Thus We explain the Aayaat [Islamic laws] in detail for people who have knowledge. </em></span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-’Araaf, 7:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Azza wa Jal) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>But seek with that [wealth] which Allaah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allaah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allaah likes not the Mufsideen [those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischiefmakers, corrupted people].</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Qasas 28:77].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas [33] asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) whether he can will all of his property in charity, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to give only one third of it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“One third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from others.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) invoked Allaah (Azza wa Jal) to grant abundant wealth to Anas Bin Maalik :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas : My mother said, “O Allaah’s Messenger! Please invoke Allaah on behalf of your servant (i.e. Anas ).” He said: “O Allaah! Increase his wealth and children, and bestow your blessings on whatever you give him.”35 There are many other texts in the Qur’aan and (or) Sunnah which teach the medium course of this Deen in its acts of worship as well as in its codes for living this life in the way that pleases Allaah (Azza wa Jal).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast, we find that the Soofee type of Zuhd opposes the essence of true Zuhd laid down in the Qur’aan, authentic Sunnah, and as understood by the Salaf, mainly that it is a renunciation of that which is of no benefit in the Hereafter. Consider, for example, some of the so-called Soofee Zuhd:(2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2) Poverty, hunger, abandonment of lawful things and of Hadeeth, and other strange things:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Soofee master said, “I like for the beginner not to make his heart busy with the matter of earning (i.e. a living), otherwise he would change.” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another master said, “I have attained this state (of Soofee knowledge) by means of a hungry stomach and a naked body.”37(!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A call to abandon marriage and the seeking of hadeeth−knowledge is attributed to the “Soofee master” AlJunayd.[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ghazaalee also related the same saying of AlJunayd: “I like for the starting Mureed (Soofee disciple) not to occupy his heart in three things, otherwise his condition will change (he then named them as): (1)-Seeking to gain sustenance, (2)-Seeking knowledge of Al-Hadeeth, and (3)- Marriage.”[39]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within Soofee sources we find the following statement: “Hunger is the food of the Zaahideen!” [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdul Wahaaab Ash-Sha’raanee, an authority on Soofism in the eyes of the Soofis reported that Rabaah Bin ‘Amr AlQayeesee said: “A man would not attain the levels of the Siddeeqeen [41] until he leaves his wife as if she was a widow, his kids as if they were orphans, and takes refuge in dog houses!” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ash-Sha’raanee, Ibraaheem Bin ‘Usayeefeer was, “A man having a great deal of Kashf &#8230;He used to come to the town riding a wolf or a hyena, and to walk on water having no need for a boat; his urine was as white as milk&#8230;Most often he slept in a church, and he used to say: the Christians, unlike Muslims, do not steal shoes in the church.”[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidated the fasting of the Muslims who ate chicken and mutton meat. Only those who, like the Christians, do not eat mutton meat, their fast is correct as far as ‘Usayeefeer is concerned! [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A story of another “Soofee”, Ibn Al-Kurainee, the teacher of Al-Junayd in which he says that he subdued himself into humiliation for twenty years until it became like that of a dog! [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Soofee sources, Abu Yazeed, an example for many Soofis, devoted himself to Allaah and he had the determination to restrain himself from drinking water and from sleeping for one year! [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Sha’raanee also reported that one of the celebrated Soofee so-called Awliyaa’ by the name of ‘Abdur Rahmaan Al-Majthoob, “Cut off his own private part in the beginning of his Jathbah (a mystic Soofee state of Jathb)”! [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also reported that another Soofee mystic by the name of Yaaqut Al-‘Arshee (d.707 AH/1307 C.E.) married the daughter of his sheikh Abul ‘Abbaas Al-Mursee. She stayed with him for eighteen years but he never touched her being shy from her father. He left her while she was still a virgin! [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are only few cases presented in order to expose this early deviation in Soofism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas, one of the early sahaabah who accepted Islam and one of the ten companions whom the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought good news that they would enter Al-Jannah. He shared in the battle of Badr and Uhud and was one of the six members of the Shoora counsel which ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab chose to appoint the new Khaleefah after ‘Umar was stabbed. He was the first to shoot an arrow at the Mushrikeen in Jihaad. He lead the Muslims in taking over ‘Iraaq from the Persians after defeating them in the battle of Al-Qaadisiyyah in the 15th year of Hijrah (634 C.E.) He died in 55th year of Hijrahh (675 C.E.).

Ihsaan quoted the text from Tabaqaat Ash-Sha’raanee, 1:7, printed by Daar Al-’Ilm Liljamee’ and Al-Matba’ah Al-’Aamiryyah Al-’Uthmaaniyyah, Cairo, 1305AH/1887 C.E.. This print of the Tabaqaat will be referred to as Tabaqaat-I.<br />

In Qutul Quloob (V. 4, p. 71) there is the story of “special people” in Basra who if they “would ask Allaah to hold off the establishment of the Hour, He would do so!” Al-Ghazaalee commented: “In themselves these are conceivable matters!” Reported in his Ihyaa’, vol. 4, p. 356.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Introduction of the Book:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">KNOW, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon me and you, that the issue of Soofism may be confusing to some and may be clear to others. Many have come to know about Soofism as the highest form of “Spiritual Islamic practices.” A kind of rich tradition, that only the special and very pious can adhere to and practice. Consequently, if Soofism is criticized, they see that as an insult to Islam. Some, however, consider Soofism as a “Spiritual” path which Muslims and non-Muslims can associate with. The fact, however, is that the reality of Soofism is known only to the few amongst Muslims. This is due, in part, to the very deceptive nature of the propagation of the teachings of Soofism as done by its advocates who present it as a very special way of worship that is linked to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his noble companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who follow their path in righteousness. Is it, however, the case?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Attempting to answer this question about “Soofism,” I ask Allaah, the Most High, to assist me in relating the truth and to make this effort sincerely done for His Most Honorable Face.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sensible person must not be deceived therefore in the deceptive ways of mystic Soofism which tries to present itself as ‘spiritual Islam.” <strong>True spiritual matters in Islam do not oppose the Sharee’ah in any way</strong>. The address of Islam to the actions of the hearts is based upon sincerity and following the path of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. This is the way that truly draws the person to Allaah.</p>
<p>May Allaah guide all Muslims to the Path of Righteousness.<br />
He is All-Able to do all things. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Following is posted from the E-Book : &#8220;<a title="Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij – Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/30/selected-examples-from-the-characteristics-of-the-extremist-khawaarij-aadil-bin-alee-al-furaydaan/">Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij</a>&#8221; &#8211; by&nbsp;Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan ,Read and Reviewed by The Noble Scholars Saalih Al-Fawzaan &amp; Muhammad Al-Khumayyis</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of the Khawaarij and a Warning against Them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Khawaarij is the plural of Khaarijee, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Guideline for Identifying a Khaarijee:</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or</p>
<p>(2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or</p>
<p>(3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil,</p></blockquote>
<p>then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Origin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the martyrdom of the Muslim Khaleefah, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab رضي الله عنه, the door to fitnah was broken, as is mentioned in the hadeeth. Then with the murder of the third Khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه in 35H, due to a conspiracy from Ibn Saba’ and those who were deluded by him, the fitnah (strife) was re-established – and we continue to see its evil effects up to this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه was given the oath of allegiance as the next Khaleefah after him, and so most of the Muslims gave their pledge of allegiance to him. However, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and those who were with him from the inhabitants of Syria did not give in to that, citing the reason for that as being the obligation of quickly bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee would tell Mu’aawiyah: “Enter into that which the people have entered into (of allegiance). And leave me to judge them. I will judge them with the truth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair رضي الله عنه&nbsp;set out for Basrah upset and seeking justice for the blood of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the <strong>Battle of the Camel</strong>, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه set out to fight against Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and the inhabitants of Syria. This is since he had called them to give the allegiance, however, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه refused to give it, claiming that they must first avenge the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee took this action of Mu’aawiyah as a rebellion against the religious rulership. So there occurred (between the army of the two of them) the <strong>battle of Siffeen</strong>. When ‘Alee and those with him were close to achieving victory, the army of Mu’aawiyah placed copies of the mus-haf high over the tips of their spears and appealed to the Book of Allaah for judgement…’Alee considered this to be a trick on their part, but he was coerced to accept the decision (for peace between the two fighting parties) on the part of some members of his army, especially the Qur’aanic reciters, out of their concern for the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the heels of this legislative decision (between the two factions), there appeared amongst the ranks of ‘Alee’s army some who opposed this decision. This opposition eventually ended up in their disobedience to the ruler and their rebelling against him. Rather, it even led them to declare ‘Alee رضي الله عنه a disbeliever as well as anyone that agreed with his decision. And they raised high their slogan: “There is no rule except for that of Allaah’s.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to reconcile with them by presenting them with arguments and proofs, and some of them returned back due to Ibn ‘Abbaas رضي الله عنه debating with them. So when the advice was not accepted by the remaining individuals that persisted in their rejection and fanaticism, ‘Alee mobilized against them and fought them. [4] This was known as the <strong>battle of Nahrawaan</strong>. ‘Alee رضي الله عنه was able to annihilate all of them except for a small portion among them that escaped to other lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After ‘Alee was murdered at the hands of some members from the Khawaarij, the danger of the Khawaarij increased. The scattered remnants of their army joined forces and spread their poison to the youth of the ummah to the point that they took on the shape of a force within the Islamic state that threatened its security and the security of the unified body of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This group did not cease attacking the Muslims from that time until now, as the Prophet صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم informed us. And they give themselves misleading names, when in reality they are just extensions of the first Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this current time, there have appeared many groups [5] that have adopted the ways and methods of the Khawaarij, and they have accepted many of their ideas and principles. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is one of the beneficial additions from Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan.<br />
[4] So ‘Alee رضي الله عنه did not fight them first, rather, it was only until they first shed innocent blood and commenced fighting with him.<br />
[5] Such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer wal-Hijrah, the Jamaa’ah Tawaqquf wa Tabayyun and other groups.<br />
[6] Such as deeming it permissible to shed unlawful blood and take unlawful wealth under the pretense of Takfeer. This refers to the rebellious and military groups..</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Audio Clip Courtesy : Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>In the lecture titled:</strong> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/01/07/the-danger-of-isis-upon-the-muslim-ummah-shaykh-muhammad-bin-ramzaan-al-haajiree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Danger of ISIS upon the Muslim Ummah &#8211; 11-03-1436 &#8211; Riyadh &#8211; Shaykh Muhammad bin Ramzaan al-Haajiree</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) told us a story of a young man.  He was a person who was involved in sinning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Normally when a person lives a life like this as soon as be becomes religious, if he lived previously in sin he wants to find the shortest or quickest path to Paradise.  And this individual arrived and sat in their localities.  He was their in their gatherings for 14 day.  One of the big players from them approached him and said:  &#8216;<strong>Ma shaa Allah, Allah has chosen you for a mission to go and blow yourself up</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8216;What?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The big player said: &#8216;We&#8217;ll put an explosive vest and you will go in the midst of these people and blow yourself up killing the kuffar and the apostates.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  They make takfeer for everything!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said:  &#8216;I want Jihaad, I want to fight. I shoot them they shoot me, back and forth, we trade fire, this is what I want.  Blowing myself up…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response of the big player was:  &#8216;Allah has chosen you to be a martyr for shahadah (martyrdom)!&#8217;<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8216;I just came, 14 days.&#8217;  He then asked the big player:  &#8216;How long have you been in Jihaad for?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response of the big player was:  &#8216;I have been in Jihaad for 14 years, when the Americans first came in to Iraaq…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8217;14 years and Allah hasn’t chosen you and 14 days and Allah has chosen me…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the leader saw the response of this young man in front of everybody. He said: &#8216;OK, the affair goes back to you, but we are going to consult amongst us and we will give you the final answer at Maghrib time.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual he recants after he escaped from them.  He knew that the Maghrib time meant that they were going to kill him at Maghrib time.  They would say that you have apostated from Islam and kill him like this. Simple as that!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  &#8216;Cold blooded murder!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said: &#8216;This young man saw them previously saw that they did this to some of the young men there.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said:  &#8216;I&#8217;m dead either way.  If I waited till Maghrib I&#8217;m dead. If I die on the way trying to escape, either way I am going to die!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he found an individual who knew somebody that he knew and this individual understood his circumstances and made easy for him an escape route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  &#8216;And of course he had no paperwork, because when he came he came as a mujahid wanting Paradise so he ripped up all of his paperwork.  Once he reached the border with Turkey, there were individuals who came from the Saudi Embassy and spoke to this individual and now he is being advised…&#8217;<strong> </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on some people who say: &#8220;O Allah, I worship You out of my love for You. If I worship You fearing Your Hell, let me enter it and if I worship You seeking to enter Your Paradise, let me enter Your Hell&#8221;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Worshiping Allah just by loving Him is the Manhaj (methodology) of misguided Sufis, which is of their own invention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loving Allah is the highest degree of Ibadah (worship), but not the sole act of Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Manhaj of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) is to worship Allah through love, fear, hope and other expressive forms of `Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord withhumility and in secret</strong></span>.&#8221; [Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about His Prophets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.&#8221;</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"> [</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about the angels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they stand in awe for fear of Him.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 28]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) elaborating on this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What do you say, may Allah preserve you, about a person who states that the issue of rebelling and opposing the ruler (king, president, government, etc.) is only a matter of Ijtihād (independent, personal interpretation) and says that there is a  difference of opinion regarding the issue among the Salaf. Therefore, it is not permissible  to accuse those who differ in this regard (those who allow political revolution and opposition) of being innovators or sinners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those Who Commit Suicide in the Name of “Jihad” are Actually Followers of Satan<br />
املنتحرون باسم اجلهاد أتباع للشيطان :Original Title<br />
Author: Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān, a member of Saudi Arabia’s council of senior scholars and the Permanent Committee of scholars, describes those who claim they are performing “Jihad” for the sake of Allah by committing suicide are actually fighting for the sake of Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who fall into this type of corruption never sought the council of any Islamic scholars, never learned anything from them. Instead, they isolate themselves from mainstream Muslims and privately accompany people who act as the worst “human idols.” Such people then began brain washing individuals until they eventually harbor enmity towards the public and thus carry out these types of attacks. They consider Muslims to be disbelievers, they murder them, blow up buildings indiscriminately killing both the young and old, male and female, Muslims and those non-Muslims guaranteed safety and living peacefully under Muslim laws (in Muslim nations) – all because of this corrupt ideology.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end result of all those who turn to wicked people for guidance and to the very callers and propagators that the messenger ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) told of when he was asked about certain trials and tribulations that will occur toward the end of time; he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ مَنْ أَطَاعَهُم قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Callers at the doors to Hell; whoever obeys them, they will cast him into it (Hell).</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the state of affairs now and it only confirms this statement of the messenger (.مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ). When such people align themselves with callers to misguidance, those callers lead others into it (misguidance or Hell). Everyone condemns them and hates their actions – both non-Muslims and believers. And no one supports their actions except those like them and those on the same methodology. This issue (of suicide attacks) is certainly a great tribulation and evil, and it is crucial that Muslims carefully understand the issue and not rush to act. Anyone (confused about the issue) should ask the people of religious knowledge to clarify the correct position and then ask Allah for guidance. People should not simply trust others with regards to this issue without knowing the reality of such propagators and whether they are established upon truth or not even though they may outwardly show good conduct, religious fervor, and honor for Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for everyone who outwardly shows good and truth yet is religiously ignorant, we must not hasten to him and give him our trust and reliance until we know the reality of him, his character, and his behavior. This only happens due to giving such a person the benefit of the doubt yet without really looking into his affairs or asking the people of knowledge, intellect, and good advice. As a result, these groups are formed because of people simply hastening to act and because of religious ignorance and mixing with evil people, trusting in them, relying on them and staying away from the mainstream Muslims and their scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Such people (suicide bombers) are always those who avoid religious lessons and the scholars so they naturally fall into these types of things. Similarly, they usually isolate themselves from their families and homes.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent especially on the Muslim youth to take a lesson from such people, for the successful people are those who learn lessons from the actions of others. We must learn from these incidents that we have to stick to our religious limits and stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and not split off from them and turn to others (for guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] This article was published in the Arabic newspaper, “Okaz,” on Thursday, April 23, 2009, issue no. 2867. For the full Arabic text, see: <a href="http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The full text of the ḥadīth is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ḥudhayfah Ibn al-Yamān said: People used to ask Allah’s messenger about good things, but I used to ask him about bad circumstances fearing that I may fall into them. So I said, “Oh messenger of Allah, we used to live in evil during the times before Islam then Allah brought us this good (Islam), so will there be more evil times after these good times?” He ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) replied, “Yes.” I further asked, “And will there then come good after that evil?” He answered, “Yes, but it will be tainted.” I asked, “Why will it be tainted?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» قَوْمٌ يَهْدُوْنَ بِغَيْرِ هَديي، تَعْرِفُ مِنْهُم وَتُنْكِرُ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be people who will guide with other than my guidance. You will recognize some things from them and reject other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, “And will there be after that good even more evil?” He replied:<br />
» نَعَم، دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ، مَنْ أَجَابَهُم إِلَيْهَا قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, there will be callers at the doors of Hell; whoever answers their call, they will cast him into it (Hell).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then said, “Oh messenger of Allah, describe them for us.” He said:<br />
» هُمْ مِنْ جِلْدَتِنَا وَيَتَكَلَّمُوْنَ بَأَلْسِنَتِنَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be from our skin (Arab) and speak our tongue (language). I asked, “So what do you instruct me to do if I reach those times?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» تَلْزِمُ جَمَاعَةَ املُسْلِمِيْنَ وَإِمَامَهُم «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stick with the mainstream group of Muslims and their leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What if there is no main group and no leader?” The prophet ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» فَاعَتَزِلْ تِلْكَ الفِرَقَ كُلَّهَا وَلَوْ أَنْ تَعُضًّ بِأْصِلِ شَجَرَةٍ حَتَّى يُدْرِكُكَ املَوْتُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى ذَلِكَ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the root of a tree and remain in that state until death comes to you.</p>
