—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [42]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from his attributes <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>خاتم الأنبياء </strong>– <strong>“The last (or seal) of the Prophets.”</strong>  The meaning of “<em><u>kh</u>aatam</em>” (خاتم &#8211; seal) is the one whom no Prophet will come after.  And the <em><u>kh</u>itaam</em> (ختام – seal) of anything is that which is placed upon it as a seal upon it so that nothing can be added to that thing and nothing can be taken away from it.  So Allaah sealed the Messengership with Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  He the Majestic, in His Highness, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men; but rather, he is the Messenger of Allaah and the seal (last) of the Prophets.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no need for the coming of any Prophet after him because the Qur.aan is present and the Prophetic Sunnah is present and the <em>`ulamaa. ar-rabbaaniyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people upon the correct way) are present – calling the people to Allaah and giving clarity to the people.  So therefore, the religion of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will remain until the establishment of the Last Hour.  It will not be changed, and it will not be abrogated, and it will not be altered because Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, has made it suitable and fitting for every time and every place.  And as for the revealed laws of the previous Prophets, then they were temporary for their nations in particular times and then Allaah abrogated those legislated laws from before, with other legislated laws suitable for other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For every people from you, we made a set of revealed laws and a clear way to proceed upon.</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>For every revealed Book there is a set time period</em></span> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, each Book (from the previous Books) has a set time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religion of Islaam is complete.  It does not need any Messenger after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And the scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.  So whoever holds the belief that there will come after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> any Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of the religion.  And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that there were going to come liars, falsely claiming Prophethood after him.  He <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سيأتي بعدي كذابون ثلاثون، كلهم يدعي أنه نبي، وأنا خاتم الأنبياء لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“There will come after me thirty great liars, each one of them claiming that he is a prophet and I am the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims Prophethood, or has Prophethood claimed on his behalf, or whoever follows them, then all of them are unbelievers (<em>kuffaar</em>).  And the Muslims have fought against them and have declared them to be unbelievers.  And the last of those whose followers claimed that he was a Prophet in this present time was that <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>.  And these people (the <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>) are called the <em>A<u>h</u>madees</em> as an ascription to his name because his name was A<u>h</u>mad <em>Al-Qaadiyaanee</em> (أحمد القادياني) and the scholars declared him to be an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and they repelled him from the lands of Islaam and the declared his followers to be unbelievers since this is a denial of Allaah and of His Messenger.  And their being unbelievers is by consensus of the Muslims; no one disagrees about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is essential that the Muslim believes that he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is the last of the Prophets and Messengers and he is the leader of those having <em>taqwaa</em> (those dutiful to Allaah); meaning, that he is the single example to be followed for those who are obedient and dutiful to Allaah, the Mighty and  Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed a fine example for you in Allaah’s Messenger for whoever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day</span></em>. (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for others besides the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he is only to be followed if he himself is following the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And as for a person who contradicts the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If you truly love Allaah then follow me, then Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.” </span></em>(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no way towards Allaah except by following the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and proceeding upon his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term: <strong>وسيد المرسلين</strong> – <strong>“And he is the noblest of the Messengers;” </strong>that is him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>; he is the noblest of the sons of Aadam just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said about himself,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏أنا سيد ولد آدم ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and that is not boasting.”</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the statement, <strong><em>“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and this is not a boast,”</em></strong> he informed his nation of that as part of giving thanks to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and also so that the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation) should give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for this favour – that He made its Messenger the noblest of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word “<em>sayyid</em>” (سيد – the noblest) means <em>al-muqaddim</em> (المقدم – the foremost one) and <em>al-imaam</em> (الإمام – the leader).  So he is the best of the Messengers `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and he is their <em>imaam</em> (leader) and he is at the head of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the term: <strong>حبيب رب العالمين</strong> – <strong>“the beloved one of the Lord of the whole of creation,”</strong> the term ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (حبيب) is a term which has a point of criticism against it because it is not sufficient to say (that the Messenger `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is) ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (the beloved one).  Rather, he is the ‘<em><u>kh</u>aleel</em>’ – the ‘especially close beloved one’ of the Lord of the creation (خليل رب العالمين).  And <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (خلة) is more excellent than just <em>ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (محبة &#8211; love) because <em>al-ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (love) is of levels and the highest of its levels is <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> which is the purest love. And no one attained this level except for two men from the creation: Ibraaheem `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (especially close beloved one)</span></em> (Sooratun-Nisaa.  (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, because he himself informed about that saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن الله اتخذني خليلًا كما اتخذ إبراهيم خليلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah took me as an especially close beloved one just as He took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (an especially close beloved one).” </em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it should not be said about him that he is <em><u>H</u>abeebullaah</em> – a beloved one of Allaah, because this term is suitable for every believer and there is nothing special for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it.  But as for being <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (an especially beloved one), then no one (from this Ummah) shares with him in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [42][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43] وكل دعوى النبوة بعده فغي وهوى‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43]     Every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous and baseless desires.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [43]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has preceded in the meaning of his being ‘the seal and last of the Prophets’.  So therefore, every claim to Prophethood after him is futile and is unbelief since there will not come any Prophet after our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  And as for `Eesaa `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, when he descends at the end of time, then it will not be upon the basis that he is a Prophet and a Messenger, nor upon the basis that he is coming with a new revealed Law.  Rather, he will come upon the basis that he is a <em>Mujaddid</em> (مجدد – Reviver) for the religion of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>on the basis that he is one following the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will judge with the Islaamic <em><u>Sh</u>aree</em>`<em>ah</em> (Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of  <u>Th</u>awbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> and the basis of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> Muslim but this full wording is reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee; declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee that <u>Th</u>awbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لا تقوم الساعة حتى تلحق قبائل من أمتي بالمشركين وحتى يعبدوا الأوثان وإنه سيكون في أمتي ثلاثون كذابون كلهم يزعم أنه نبي وأنا خاتم النبيين لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘The last hour will not be established until some tribes of my nation join with the mu<u>sh</u>riks and until they worship the idols and there will be in my nation thirty great liars, each one claiming that he is a prophet and I am the seal of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me’.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Sa`eed Al-<u>Kh</u>udree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>; declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>is reported by Muslim and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdillaah ibn Mas`ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لو كنت متخذًا من أهل الأرض خليلًا لاتخذت ابن أبي قحافة خليلًا، ولكن صاحبكم خليل الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“If I were to take a specially beloved friend from the people of the earth, I would have taken Ibn Abee Qu<u>h</u>aafah (Aboo Bakr) as an especially close beloved friend; however, your companion (meaning himself) is the <u>Kh</u>aleel of Allaah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: There is a narration that <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee points out is weak in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah.  It is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> and in it is quoted that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ألا وأنا حبيب الله ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“I am the <u>H</u>abeeb (beloved one) of Allaah and that’s not boasting.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions that this narration is <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak), not authentic.  It is weak because it has the narrator Zam`ah ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and also the narrator Salamah ibn Wahraam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
Al-‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah – Sharh wa Ta’leeq (pg. 39-40)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed his ummah in many ahaadeeth, advising and cautioning them, that there would be many imposters (Dajjaaleen) after him. In some narrations, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Everyone will claim to be a prophet, whereas I am the seal of the prophets – there being no prophet after me.”</b> [Reported by Muslim and others; See <i>al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</i>: no. 1683]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst these imposters was Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiyani who claimed prophethood for himself. He has followers spread throughout India, Germany, England and America. And they have masaajid which they use to misguide the Muslims. There were some individuals amongst them in Syria as well, but Allaah uprooted them and eradicated them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have many vile beliefs apart from their belief that prophethood continued after Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). The one who preceded them in this belief is Ibn ‘Arabee, the Sufi. They have authored a treatise on this subject in which they have collected statements from him that serve as support for this afore-mentioned belief of theirs. And the mashaayikh were not able to refute it because it was from that which Ibn ‘Arabee said (!!) even though they asserted with certainty that they were disbelievers. There is no room to mention their beliefs here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt they are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah intended when he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said in the hadeeth that has been authentically reported from him: <b>“There will be lying impostors during the Last Days that will bring you narrations, which neither you nor your forefathers heard of. So beware and let them beware, lest they misguide you and bring calamity upon you.”</b> [Reported by the author (i.e. At-Tahaawee) in <i>Mushkil-ul-Athaar</i> (4/104). It is also found in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> (1/9)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From their most distinguishing signs is that when they begin speaking about their Call (i.e. beliefs), before everything, they start out with affirming the death of ‘Eesaa (Jesus). When they are able to accomplish this – according to their perception – they proceed onto the next level, which involves mentioning the ahaadeeth that talk about the descent of ‘Eesaa, and make it clear that that they believe in these narrations. However, they then quickly move on to distorting their meanings by claiming that what is meant by them is the descent of someone similar to ‘Eesaa (Jesus), since they have already established and confirmed – according to their views – that ‘Eesaa (Jesus) died. So they claim that this person was Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadiyani!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have many, many other examples of distorting texts similar to this, which leads us to believe that they are a group from amongst the heretical Baatinees. We will point out some of their deviant beliefs soon by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the misguided beliefs of the Qadiyanis is that they reject the Jinn as being a creation apart from mankind. So they distort the apparent meaning of all the ayaat and ahaadeeth that clearly prove their existence and their distinction from mankind amongst creation, instead claiming that these texts refer to humans themselves or a specific group from amongst mankind. This is even the case with Iblees (i.e. the Devil) himself as they allege that he was a human being that was evil! So how misguided they are!!</p>

<p><b>Al-Qadianiyyah order</b></p>
<p><b>The third question of Fatwa no.</b><b> 1615</b></p>
<p>Q 3: What is the ruling on this new faith and its followers, I mean Al-Ahmadiyyah faith? Callers to this faith warn against memorizing any Ayahs from the Qur’an or the Names of Allah and prohibit invoking blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him). Where and when did this faith originate? What is the ruling on those who avoid it?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The<span id="ContentParagraph"> Pakistani </span>government, the Muslim World League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah </span>and the Organization of Islamic Conference held in the League in 1394 A.H. issued a declaration that this (Qadiani) sect is outside the fold of Islam. The Conference published a report on the origin of this sect, when and how it was founded, and many other details disclosing its reality.</p>
<p><span id="ContentParagraph"><b>In conclusion, </b>it is a sect claiming that the Indian leader Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (born in the thirteenth century) was a prophet who received revelation and that anyone who disbelieves in him is not considered a true Muslim. Allah (Exalted be He) states in His Book that our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Seal (Last) of the Prophets.<a title="Click here"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/margntip.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a> Muslim scholars are unanimously agreed upon this. Whosoever claims that after him there is a prophet receiving revelationfrom Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) commits an act of Kufr (disbelief). This is because such a person goes against the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Islamic Ummah (nation) and denies what is stated in the Qur’an and the authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) which affirm that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Last of all prophets.</span></p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Q: I hope you can explain the ruling on the Sufi order called Al-Qadyaniyyah and their alleged prophet Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadyany I ask you kindly to send me any books related to this order as I am very interested in studying it.</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace be upon him), and there is no prophet after him. This is authentically proved by the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and whoever claims otherwise, or claims Prophethood, then he is a <strong>liar</strong>. Foremost among those people is<span id="ContentParagraph"> Ghulam Ahmad Al-Qadyany </span>whose claim of Prophethood is nothing but falsehood, and so what his followers claim in this regard is also falsehood.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Council of Senior Scholars issued a decree regarding<strong><span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Qadyaniyyah </span>as a Kafir (disbelieving) sect</strong> for their claims.</p>

<p><strong>The difference between the Muslims and Al-Ahmadiyyin</strong></p>
<p><b></b><b>Q 3: </b>What is the difference between the Muslims and Al-Ahmadiyyin ?</p>
<p><b>A: </b><b>The difference between them </b>is that Muslims are people who worship Allah Alone, follow His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), and believe that Muhammad is the last of all prophets.
