<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 74 : Point 124</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The five daily prayers are permissible behind anyone except a <span style="color:#993300;"><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/"><em>Jahmee</em></a></span>, since he is one who totally negates </strong>(all of the attributes of Allah)<strong>. If you have prayed behind him, then repeat your prayer. And if he is your Imam on the day of <em>Jumu’ah</em>, and he is a ruler, then pray behind him, </strong>(but)<strong> repeat your prayer [1]. If your <em>Imaam</em>, whether a ruler or not, is a person of the Sunnah, then pray behind him and do not repeat the prayer.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] This is reported by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad as the saying of his father, Imaam Ahmad, in <em>as-Sunnah</em> (nos.4-5).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They </strong>(Jahmiyyah)<strong> continued in time and found rulers who were to assist them in this and who subjected those who refused it to the sword or the whip. Knowledge of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> was wiped away and weakened by them so that they became suppressed due to the manifesting of innovation and speech about it and their great number. They established sittings, manifested their opinions, wrote books about them, enticed the people and they sought leadership for them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It was a very great trial </strong></span>[2]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. Only those whom Allah protected were saved from it. The slightest that a person would be affected by sitting with them was that he would be caused to doubt about his religion, or to follow them, or to hold their saying to be true,not knowing whether it was the truth of falsehood, so he became one who doubted. So the people were ruined until the time of Ja’far, who was known as al-Mutawakkil </strong></span>[3]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>, through whom Allah extinguished innovation and manifested the truth and the people of the Sunnah. They spoke out, despite their small number and the great number of innovators, right up to this day of ours </strong></span>[4]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for their principles and misguidance, some of them have remained acting upon it and calling to it, with none to prevent them from their sayings and actions!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Proclamation was made that everyone had to adhere to the belief of the Mu’tazilah that the Qur’an was created! The scholars were threatened and ordered to agree to this. Those who refused to assent verbally were imprisoned, threatened with death and tortured. Imam Ahmad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) stood firm, despite months in prison, constantly being brought before those in authority and threatened with death and kept in chains. Eventually, he was lashed severely in public. ‘Alee ibn al-Madeenee said, “<strong>Indeed, Allah aided this religion through Abu Bakr on the Day of Apostasy (<em>riddah</em>) and through Ahmad ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial (<em>mihnah</em>)</strong>.” Reported by adh-Dhahabee in Tadhkiratul-Huffaadh (2/432).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The ‘Abbaasid caliph, al-Mutawakkil ‘alallaah: Abul-Fadl, Ja’far, son of al-Mu’tasim billaah, al-Qurashee. He died in the year 247 after the Hijrah. May the Mercy of Allah be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Refer to the letter of Ahmad ibn Hanbal to al-Mutawakkil, mentioned in <em>as-Sunnah</em> of his son, ‘Abdullah, as point number 84.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some of the scholars, amongst them Ahmad ibn Hanbal, declared the Jahmee to be a disbeliever and not from the people of the Qiblah. His blood is lawful. He does not inherit, neither is inheritance received from him, since he says that <em>there is no Jumu’ah or congregational prayer, no ‘Eid prayer, no charity (Sadaqah)</em> and because they say, “<em>One who does not say the Qur’an is created is a disbeliever</em>.” They allow fighting and killing within the nation of Muhammad (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). They contradict those who preceded them. They put the people to trial regarding something that neither the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) nor any of his Companions spoke about.</strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They desire to empty the Mosques and for the congregations to be neglected. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They weakened Islam, caused Jihaad to be left and busied themselves with sectarianism. They went against the narrations and spoke up with that which had been abrogated </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. They used verses of uncertain meaning as clear proof and so caused the people to have doubts about their religion. They disputed about their Lord and said, “<em>There is no punishment in the grave, nor any Pond (Hawd), nor any Intercession and Paradise and the Fire have not been created</em>.” They rejected much of what the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said. Those who permit the declaration of their being unbelievers declare them to be so and declare the spilling of their blood to be lawful because of these matters, since whoever rejects a verse from the Book of Allah has rejected the whole Book and whoever rejects a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) has rejected all of his sayings and is a disbeliever in Allah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Mu’tazilah and the Raafidah denied abrogation (<em>naskh</em>). Before them, the Jews had denied it.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Transcript of the Audio:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And some of the scholars; amongst them Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal said: ‘The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>, his blood can be lawfully shed, he does not inherit nor is inheritance received from him. Since he says, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer, no congregational prayer, no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no charity.” And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The saying of the scholars: “The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the Qiblah,”</strong> meaning <em>Kaafir</em>; he is a disbeliever on account of his blind sayings because he has negated Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And there is no doubt that this is the worst of disbelief. Their sayings of disbelief lead to <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (total negation), as was said by the Shaykh (the author) and it is denial of the existence of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And Imaam A<u>h</u>mad <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> has refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah,</em> and this is printed and verified &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. And a number of the people have refuted them. Shaykh ul-Islaam refuted them in his huge book <em>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He (the Jahmee), his blood is lawful to be shed, he does not inherit not is inheritance taken from him.”</strong> Because he is a <em>Murtad</em> (apostate), so therefore his blood is lawful to be shed because that which renders a person’s blood secure is Islaam whereas the <em>Kaafir</em>; his blood is lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because he says (the Jahmee; the follower of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan) that, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and there is no <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (congregational) prayer,” </strong>because Al-Jahm denied the <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and he denied the congregational prayer. All that is sufficient in his view is <em>al-ma`rifatu billaah</em> (a person has awareness of Allaah). So <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) with him is just <em>al-ma`rifah</em> (awareness). So if a person is aware of his Lord in his heart then he becomes a believer; <em>mu·min</em> who is perfect in his <em>eemaan</em> even if he doesn’t pray, even if he doesn’t fast, even if he doesn’t do anything from the acts of worship at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he said that, “There are no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no <em><u>S</u>adaqah</em> (charity). </strong>Because he held that deeds are not a part of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) nor its utterance upon the tongue nor is belief either. Rather, <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in his view is near <em>ma`rifah</em> (awareness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.” </strong>The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said, “Whoever doesn’t say that the Qur·aan is created and rather says that the Qur·aan is the speech of Allaah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has caused Allaah to resemble His creation and <em>Tashbeeh</em> (declaring resemblance to the creation) is <em>kuffar</em> (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they permitted use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>! And they contradicted those who came before them, they put the people to trial with something which neither Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor anyone from his companions spoke with. They sought for the emptying and abandonment of the mosques and the congregations. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they held as lawful the use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>!” </strong>They permitted killing the Muslims; those who disagreed with them in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). And therefore when they gained authority in the time of Al-Ma·moon, what did they do to the Muslims? They killed those of the scholars whom they killed and they tortured those who they tortured in order to try and force them to hold the saying that was the position of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they contradicted whoever came before them,”</strong> from the Muslims. So these sayings did not appear except from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“they put the people to trial with something which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not speak with.” </strong>They wanted to force the people to accept their saying as occurred in the time of Al-Ma·moon and those who came after him when they tried to force the people to accept the saying that the Qur·aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they wanted to empty out the mosques and the congregations. </strong>Because their position with regard to <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is that it is merely awareness, even if the person does not do any action, even if he does not speak with his tongue, even if he does not hold belief in his heart. So therefore, there would be no need for the mosques and the congregations because the prayer is not obligatory in their view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they weakened Islaam, caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left and busied themselves with causing separation, they contradicted the narrations and they spoke with that which had been abrogated, they utilised unclear text as proof and they caused the people to have doubts about their religion. And they disputed regarding their Lord and they said: “There is no punishment in the graves nor any great reservoir; <em>al-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> nor any intercession; <em>shafaa`ah;</em> and that Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” And they denied much of that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said. So therefore, those who permitted that they be declared disbelievers declared that their blood may be lawfully shed from this aspect. Since whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book and whoever rejects a single <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations. And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And they caused weakness in Islaam,” </strong>meaning, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> weakened Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left,” </strong>they left off Jihaad in the cause of Allaah because they do not hold that disbelievers are to be declared disbelievers because they have awareness of Allaah. And this means that Fir`awn was a Muslim then because he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the context of what Musa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to Fir`awn when he went to call him to the truth that he said to him: “You indeed know that no-one has sent these signs except the Lord of the heavens and the earth&#8230;” </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. And the people of <em>shirk</em>; the <em>mushrikoon</em> in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; they had awareness of Allaah in their hearts. Indeed they used to worship Him with different types of acts of worship so they believed that Allaah &#8211; the Perfect &#8211; is the Lord and that He deserves worship. However, they associated others in worship along with Him claiming that those others besides Him will draw them closer to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they contradicted the narrations,” </strong>meaning they contradicted the evidences and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they spoke with the abrogated texts,” </strong>they took a hold of evidences that had been abrogated and they do not act upon the text which abrogates in order to misguide just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…So as for those in whose hearts there is deviation then they follow that which is unclear from it… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the <em>Mutashaabih</em>, from that which is unclear on its own is the <em>Mansookh</em>, those texts that have been abrogated because it is necessary for the person to have awareness of the <em>Naasikh</em> and the <em>Mansookh</em> (the text which abrogates and the earlier text which was abrogated). And also <em>al-mu<u>t</u>laq w`al muqayyad</em> (to have awareness of the unrestricted text and the restricted texts) and the <em>khaa<u>s</u></em> and the `<em>aam</em> (the text which has been specified and the general text). He must have awareness of the branches of knowledge for the derivation of evidences. So, he does not use as evidence just any text, which he finds without seeing whether it is something abrogated or whether it is something which has been made specific by something or whether it is something which has been restricted by something; not examining this on account of deviation and in order to misguide the people. And they say that: “We use the Qur·aan as proof.” But they are not actually using the Qur·aan as proof. The Qur·aan is used as proof by those who accept all of it. But as for one who takes just a part of it and leaves the other parts then he is a disbeliever in it. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Do you believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in other parts?&#8230; </strong>(Sooratul Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who does not gather between the <em>Muhkam</em> and <em>Mutashaabih</em> (clear and clarifying texts along with the texts, which are unclear) combine the two then this one is taking a part of the Book and leaving a part. And therefore, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Whereas those firmly grounded in knowledge they say: “We believe in it, all of it.” … </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: “<em>Kullun</em>” (All of it); meaning the <em>Muhkam</em> (those texts which are clear and clarified) and the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which is not immediately clear with regard to its meaning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…They say: “All of it is from our Lord”… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, they refer the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those texts, which are unclear) to the <em>Muhkam</em> (to that text, which is clear and clarifies it) so therefore, it explains it and clarifies it. However, this requires a scholar; `<em>aalim</em>. It is not permissible for a pretender to knowledge to enter into it or a person who is a deviant intending to misguide. So, the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (the text, which is unclear) will not be taken hold of except by 1 of 2 kinds of men; either one who is <em>zaa·igh</em> (deviant) and intends to misguide like the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. And therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad said about them: “They use as evidence that which is unclear from the Qur·aan.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second type of person who uses the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those aayahs, which are not on their own clear with regard to their meaning) or otherwise a <em>Muta`aalim</em> (a false pretender to knowledge who doesn’t realise and speaks about Allaah without knowledge.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they used unclear texts as proof,” </strong>and therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em>. He brought the texts which they use as evidence, and he refuted their opinion about them, and he made clear the correct understanding of those texts and he harmonised between the <em>aayahs</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“so they caused the people to have doubts about their religion.”</strong> So there is no doubt that this is confusion in thoughts and ideas. So, it is not permissible to speak about matters of knowledge and especially matters of <em>`aqaa·id</em> (creed and beliefs) except one who firmly grounded in knowledge. It’s not permissible for them to be spoken about by half students or by false claimants to knowledge not to mention by people of deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they disputed concerning their Lord,” </strong>they innovated <em>al-jadal</em> (newly brought about argumentation, religious debating). He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No-one disputes about the signs (<em>aayaat</em>) of Allaah except for those who disbelieve. So do not let their travelling about upon the land deceive you. </strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer does not dispute about the <em>aayaat</em> of Allaah. Rather, he accepts them and he believes, he holds as his belief that they are the speech of Allaah and that they are good and guidance. But as for the person who just withholds about them and raises doubts then this is one who disputes about the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no punishment of the grave,” </strong>This fully confirms with their <em>madhhab</em> because in their view whoever has awareness of Allaah then he is a believer of it and it is not necessary that he has to pray and fast and perform <em>Hajj</em> and perform `<em>Umrah</em> nor carry out the deeds. And based upon this there will be no punishment in the grave because all of mankind have awareness of Allaah and therefore, there is no sin and obedience so those who are in the graves all have awareness of Allaah. So therefore, they will not be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Great Reservoir) nor any <em>shafaa`ah</em> (intercession),” </strong>All of the affairs of the hidden and the unseen; <em>ghaib</em>, they denied them because they place reliance upon their intellects alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” </strong>Meaning the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created despite the fact that Allaah has informed that they are already created. He, the Most High said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paradise has already been prepared for the <em>Muttaqeen</em> (People of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to Allaah). </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aw-Iddat</em> (already prepared); it shows that it’s already been prepared and is present and He said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It has already been prepared for the disbelievers. </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that the severe heat in the summer is from the breathing out of the Hellfire and this indicates that it is present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the fire has 2 breaths; a breathing in, in the winter and that is the severest cold that you find and it has a breath (breathing out) in the summer time and that is the severest heat that you find. The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The severest summer heat is from the breathing out of the Hellfire.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they denied much of that which was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong>They denied much of that which occurs in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> because it contradicts their opinion and what they believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So those who held it lawful to declare them as disbelievers declared their blood lawful to shed from this aspect.” </strong>Those of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> who declared them to be disbelievers; that he declared them to be disbelievers on account of all of these filthy sayings gathered because they result in there not being any religion left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book,” </strong>As has preceded that whoever takes as proof part of the Qur·aan; believes in other parts so regarding some he tends to cling onto it then he has believed only in a part of the Book and he has left the other part. So a person who uses as proof that which is unclear (the <em>Mutashaabih</em>) and leaves aside the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he is from those who believe in a part of the Book and reject other parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever rejects a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations.” </strong>Likewise, the <em>Sunnah</em> contains that which is <em>Muhkam</em> (clear and clarified) and it contains that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which on its own is unclear). So whoever takes that which is unclear from the <em>Sunnah</em> and leaves off the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he has rejected all of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.” </strong>This is the result and Allaah’s refuge is sought because the one who truly believes in Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The true believer says, “We have <em>eemaan</em> in all of it, we believe in it. All of it is from our Lord.” </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of deviation then he takes that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (unclear) because it is more fitting for his purpose. And as for the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear, clarifies) then it does not suit his purpose so he leaves it. This is the way of people of the desires, the way of the deviated sects always and it is not specific to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, its origin was from the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, the people of the deviated sects, all of them in every time, this is their way. They take hold of those proofs, only the ones that will conform to their desires and they leave whatever conflicts with their desires. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <em>Ar-Rad`alaa azzanaadiqah w`al-Jahmiyyah</em> (Imaam A<u>h</u>mad’s refutation of the <em>Zindeeqs</em> and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee<em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, `His saying, <strong>“they spoke with that which has been abrogated,”</strong> what he intended was that they deny abrogation; the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> deny <em>naskh</em> (deny that there is abrogation). So, the <em>Jahmiyyah </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em>Raafidah</em> and before them the Jews denied there being any abrogation and they said; “Abrogation does not occur, neither in the Qur·aan nor in the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Salaf</em> have refuted them.`</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (reference should be <u>h</u>adeeth no. 533/534) from Aboo Hurayrah and Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> and also reported by Muslim (615) from Aboo Hurayrah and likewise by Muslim (2209) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> A point that’s brought by some of the explainers, they mention Ibn al-Qayyim with regard to the declaration of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; the disbelievers, Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said in his famous poem; An-Nooniyyah that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> were declared to be disbelievers by 500 scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong><em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said on this point with regard to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is a disbeliever; “this saying where the author mentioned at great length then in summary it is that he passed the judgement that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> are disbelievers and there is no doubt of the disbelief of the first <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who founded it, the initial <em>Jahmiyyah</em> but as for the second (later <em>Jahmiyyah</em>) who had developed into the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> then those people no-one from the <em>Salaf</em> declared them to be disbelievers. So the speech of the author is not to be taken unrestrictedly. And then he intended here that the affair itself is disbelief. So as for one who is upon it; a particular individual then he is to be examined. Have the conditions meaning declaring him to be <em>kaafir</em> been fulfilled and have any preventing factors been removed or not? So if the conditions for him to be declared a disbeliever are present and any preventing factor is absent then the judgement will be passed upon anyone who denies anything that the author has already mentioned here or who rejects anything from the texts, he will be judged to be a disbeliever if the proof is established upon him; conditions for declaring him so are present and preventing factors are absent.” And then he mentioned the issue with regard to the individual as well-that detail is necessary, Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> was that they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. They introduced &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217;. They abandoned the narrations. And they applied analogy , they weighed the religion according to their opinion.

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> came about because they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>the reason which caused the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> to become misguided to this great extent of misguidance is that they entered into the affair of the Lord, they began searching into it. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to search into the matter of the Lord. Rather, what is upon him is to have eemaan in Him and His Names and in His Attributes and not to enter into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one knows about His Self and about how His Names and Attributes are except for Him, He, the Perfect. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah knows whatever is before them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with Knowledge.</span> </strong>(Soorah-<u>T</u>aa Haa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one can encompass Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; He is the one who knows best about Himself and about other than Himself. So, therefore, we do not speak about the affair of Allaah except for that about which there is a proof from the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the Sunnah. And we withhold from whatever does not occur; whatever is not reported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> denied the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and they entered with their intellects into the affair of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High to the extent that they said that: ‘<em>He is not within the Universe nor is He outside the Universe, He is not above nor is He beneath, He is not to the right nor is He to the left.</em>’ Therefore, He would not exist then &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above what they say. They said: ‘<em>He does not have hearing, He doesn’t hear and He doesn’t see and He doesn’t have knowledge and He doesn’t have will</em>.’ Therefore, He would be inanimate; non-living thing because an inanimate object is that which is described with these characteristics. So He would in that case be like the idols &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“They imagined and made analogies with regard to the religion based upon their own opinion,” </strong>They followed false analogy, they drew analogy between Allaah and His creation and therefore they denied His Names and His Attributes because in their view they necessitated resemblance. And they did not know that the Names of Allaah and His Attributes are particular to Him, He the Perfect and that the names of the created being and the attributes of the created being are specific to them and there is no resemblance between this and that. So, just as Allaah has a self, which does not resemble the selves of creation then likewise He has Names and Attributes, which do not resemble the names and attributes with the created being. Whoever takes hold of this will be at ease and proceed upon the correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they came with disbelief openly, it was not hidden.” </strong>They disbelieved in Allaah on account of these ugly sayings concerning Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they disbelieved and they declared the rest of the creation to be disbelievers.” </strong>They declared as disbelievers those people who describe Allaah with His Names and His Attributes because they say they are <em>mushabbihah</em> (they are ones who claim that Allaah resembles His creation) and <em>tashbeeh</em> (declaring the creator resembles the creation) is disbelief; <em>kufr</em>. So we say no, this is not <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance). Allaah the Majestic and Most High, He, the Perfect has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Allaah and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.</span> </strong>(Sooratus-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negated from Himself <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) and yet He affirmed for Himself Hearing and Seeing even though hearing and seeing are present amongst the created beings. So this shows that this does not resemble that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>&#8220;And the affair unnecessarily led them to stating total negation.” </strong><em>At-Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> is to deny the Creator, the Perfect and Most High. Because this leads to negation because one who does not hear and he does not see and he does not speak and has no will and has no wish and also is not inside the Universe nor is he outside the Universe and is not above and is not below. Therefore, there was no God who is worshipped in existence at all. So the affair ended up for them with apostasy and total negation.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side-point</strong>: If you read the story of Jahm ibn Safwaan exactly what happened to him. They say he debated with some people who doubted his Lord and he ended up doubting that they had a Lord so he even abandoned the prayer for a period of 40 days or something. They confused him so much with regard to his Creator, who are you going to pray to then? So the Shaykh said they refer the affair of Jahm and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, that’s what it lead to, it leads to this; <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation of the Creator) altogether; denial of the Creator.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah affirmed speech; <em>al-Kalaam</em> for Himself in many <em>aayahs</em>, from them is the saying; He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If the water of the ocean were ink to write down the words of My Lord then the ocean would be exhausted before the words of My Lord were finished&#8230;”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah</em> 109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the words of Allaah with which He commands and forbids and manages the creation with. Who can then enumerate the words of Allaah, He, the Perfect and Most High? They could not be written down by the oceans nor by all of the pens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the speech of Allaah, the <em>Kalaam</em> is as said by the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to its type; eternal, with respect to its individual instances, it newly comes about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Qadeemun-Nau`</em> means that Allaah, the Most High has always had the attribute of speech. However, with regard to individual instances, for example, Allaah, the Most High speaking to Aadam or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Moosaa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or speaking to Jibreel with the <em>Qur·aan</em> then these individual instances of the speech of Allaah; they newly occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is from the newly occurring instances of the speech of Allaah and some individual instances of the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of Allaah is confirmed by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And there is no doubt that sound intellect affirms speech for Allaah because it is <em><u>S</u>ifatul Kamaal</em> (hidden attribute of perfection) and negation of it is an attribute of deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan who was a foul person who appeared amongst the people and tried to cause them to doubt about the religion of Allaah and he commanded them with apostasy and disbelief. And from that is that he tried to cause them to doubt about the fact that Allaah speaks and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The speech of Allaah which is present is something created; <em>makhlooq</em>. He created it in the Preserved Tablet or He created it in Jibreel or He created it in Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is therefore just an ascription of a created thing to its creator just like saying <em>Baitullaah</em> (the House of Allaah) or <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (the she camel of Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said  ̶ may Allaah disfigure him. He said Allaah does not speak and the ascription of speech to Him is just an ascription of a created thing to its Creator. This is from his <em>mathhab</em> (position). And he also had the position of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Jabr</em> with regard to <em>Qadr</em> (predecree); that people are compelled to do their deeds, no free will. And he had the position of with regard to denying the names and attributes and he also had a position with regard to denying the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the <em>Qur·aan</em> also. So he was a filthy apostate who appeared with the likes of this falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>mathhab</em> was derived from the Jews as was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah in the introduction to <em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>. And Al-Jahm, he was not the one who began this <em>mathhab</em>. Before him, there was Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham; he is the one who initiated this repulsive saying. And he took it from <u>T</u>aaloot; the Jew and <u>T</u>aaloot took it from Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am, the Jew who did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this saying is derived from the Jews, those who distort the speech of Allaah, away from its correct meaning, so this foul <em>mathhab</em> should not be considered something inexplicable when its source is known that it is from the Jews. They infiltrated it amongst the Muslims by means of this foul man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham, the one who was killed by Khaalid al-Qasree on the Day of <em>Eid ul-A<u>d</u>haa</em> as Ibn-ul Qayyim mentioned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[1]</span></a> So therefore Ibn-ul Qayyim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>And on account of that, Khaalid Al–Qasree slaughtered </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ja`ad on the Day of the Sacrifice </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Since he said Ibraaheem was not Allaah’s chosen beloved one</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>No, and nor was Moosaa one who He spoke to and drew close </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>So every person of Sunnah is thanked for that sacrifice</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">What an excellent thing Allaah has brought about through the sacrifice of this brother</span> </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[2]</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was taken from him by Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and it became ascribed to him because he is the one who propagated it but he is not the one who initiated it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of the Sunnah rebuked and criticized them severely (the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>). And they spoke sternly in that regard and this will follow inshaaAllaah, the part that comes after. However, with us now we have a part of this foul <em>mathhab</em>, which is negation of speech for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a problem arose with the People of the <em>Sunnah</em>, should it be said, “My recital of the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is created or is not created?” This is something which they introduced also amongst the Muslims. So should you say: “My recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created or should you say my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is not created or should you <em>tatawaqqaf</em> (withhold)? And say if what you mean is what is recited, that which is recited, then it is the speech of Allaah, it is not created. And if what is meant is a person’s own particular recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> then his own recital is a created thing and his voice is created. So therefore it must be mentioned with detail and it must be given then with detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the detail, which was stated by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bukhaariyy and a group of the verifiers. So do not say: my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created unrestricted and do not say it’s not created unrestrictedly and do not withhold. Rather, mention the answer with detail that <span style="color:#333399;">if what you mean is what I’m reciting then that is the speech of Allaah, that is not created or if what is meant is the person’s own particular recitation, his own particular voice then that is created. That is the detail</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side-point: And he quotes three famous lines from the Nooniyyah of Ibn-ul Qayyim, poem on `<em>aqeedah</em>, each line ending in <em>noon</em>, concerning this event that this man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham that he was killed by Khaalid Al-Qasree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side-point: They mention this happened around the year 118 AH in Kufa that Khaalid Al-Qasree who was the governor in Iraq at that time that he slaughtered this evil person Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side-point: Some of the people of Knowledge mention is that this saying that we heard was taken by Jahm from Al-Ja`ad and he took it from Taaloot and he took it from Labeed. Then this Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am was a Jew. As we heard he did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his saying was taken from him by Taaloot; the Jew and from him, his student Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham took this saying, the saying of the Jahmiyyah. And from Al-Ja`ad was taken by his student Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and each was executed. We saw Al-Ja`ad being executed here and likewise Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, he was killed as well; his student but before that, each time before the person was executed or killed, he had a famous student who took the saying from him. So, Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, this saying was taken from him by Bishr al-Marisee and then he, Bishr al-Marisee, he taught this to A<u>h</u>mad ibn Abee Du`aad, the one who was at the head of those who tortured Imaam A<u>h</u>mad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just briefly with regard to the event; before the event that Khalid al-Qasree slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham on the Day of Sacrifices. He gave a <em>khutbah</em> to the people on the `<em>Eid</em> and he said: May Allaah accept your sacrifices for indeed I am going to sacrifice Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham and he came down and he slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this report: “There’s some speech from the scholars, is it established or not? This is reported by a number of the scholars in their books Ad-Daarimee in <em>Ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em> and Al-Bukhaariyy in his book <em>Khalq Af`alul-`Ibaad</em> and other books as well. Then Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>Mukhta<u>s</u>ar al-`Uluw</em>, Ath-Thahabee’s book <em>Al `Uluw</em>, the originate of it, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy comments, he mentions that the first chain of narration for this that there is weakness in it, there is unknown people in the chain. But then he said, however, the narration that comes after it, another narration with a different chain is better than it and perhaps therefore that is why the scholars state that this story definitely happened. Meaning, there is more than one chain of narration before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Translator’s side-point:  With regard to the explanation of Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after mentioning a number of evidences from the <em>Qur·aan</em> affirming that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is indeed the speech of Allaah, not created and the speech of Allaah is an attribute of His. Then he said: ‘And whoever says that anything from the attributes of Allaah is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> have affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Al-Laalikaa’ee referring to here Imaam Al–Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; famous book of `<em>aqeedah</em> mentioned from 550 scholars from the <em>Salaf</em> that they said: ‘Whoever says that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and whoever says that his recitation of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is something created then he is an innovator, a <em>Jahmi</em> (he is astray). And likewise, one who remains silent and doesn’t say whether it’s created or not created, he is also a <em>Jahmi</em> (astray). So what Allaah has informed is very clear that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is the speech of Allaah and whoever will not say that then he has belied Allaah in what He has informed of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s side point: Obviously the last part of the text here is taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times, <strong><em>“Whoever lives long amongst you will see great differing</em></strong>…<strong>”</strong> and the rest of the point taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Al-Irbaa<u>d</u> Ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, Abu Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 56: Point 98 (Start of Volume 2)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the scholars did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the lowly and despicable folk  (<em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah)</em> spoke concerning public affairs. And they spoke against the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared those who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/jahmiyyah-and-ruwaybidah-the-lowly-despicable-folk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the People of Knowledge did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah,” </strong></span>the Jahmiyyah; a definition of them has preceded already that they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan who propagated the foul saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and who openly proclaimed negation of the names of Allaah and His attributes and he had the saying of <em>Al-Irjaa`</em> (taking actions out of <em>eemaan</em>) and he had a foul <em>ma<u>dh</u>hab</em> (path).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his followers are called the Jahmiyyah as an ascription to al-Jahm. And from the worst, most ugly of their sayings is the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and denying the names and attributes of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and distorting the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger with falsehood; explaining it and distorting it with falsehood. So they (Jahmiyyah) are the most dangerous of the sects and the most ugly of the sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the People of Knowledge did not leave them alone, rather, they rebutted their doubts and refuted their sayings and demolished them. And this is present in the books of the People of Knowledge. From them is the refutation of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> upon the Jahmiyyah and this is present and is printed. And from them is the refutation of `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed ad-Daarimee upon Bishr al-Mareesee al-`Aneed and it is printed also. And from them is <em>Bayaanu Talbeesil-Jahmiyyah</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and from them is<em> Ijtimaa`ul Juyoosh Islaamiyyah `alaa Ghazwal Mu`attillah w’al Jahmiyyah</em> of Ibnul Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“until in the <em>Khilaafaa </em>(caliphate) of <em>Banul `Abbaas </em>(`Abbaasids),” </strong></span>in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon who was from the <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, evil occurred. And those who are not suitable to speak, spoke. They spoke with regard to knowledge and with regard to the fundamentals; those who are not suitable to speak. And if a person speaks about something other than his own speciality, then the affairs will be corrupted. So it is essential that no-one speaks about the affairs of the religion and of knowledge except the people who are specialised in it and the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affairs will not be rectified by chaos; by everyone speaking and claiming to have knowledge as is present now from those <em>muta`aalimeen</em> (pretenders to knowledge); those who ruminate (think deeply) upon questions of <em>`aqeedah</em> and speak about <em>eemaan</em> and what is the reality of <em>eemaan</em>. And they speak about things which they have no right to speak about at all. They have no knowledge and they do not learn with the scholars. Rather, they just learned by themselves and they rely upon their own understandings and they start laying down principles from themselves and from their own understandings. So, the affair is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“so then in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) started speaking about <em>amaril `aammah</em> (affairs of the masses and the people).”</strong></span> This occurs in a narration; meaning this will be from the signs of the Last Hour that public affairs are spoken about by those who are not known for `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) and their speaking is one of the signs of the Hour. So it is not right that such a person should speak about the public affairs and about the general matters, which affect everybody. No-one should speak about that except for the People of Knowledge; those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And this should not be entered into by everyone just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if some matters relating to public safety or fear come to them, they broadcast it, and if only they had referred it back to the Messenger and to those in charge with authority amongst them, then the reality of the matter would be known to those who are able to verify and deduce.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa·(4), <em>aayah</em> 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So public affairs affecting the nation (<em>ummah)</em> are not to be spoken about except by the people who are specifically qualified to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they spoke against the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.”</span> </strong>They interfered even in the <em>A<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>, they make attacks upon them and they write works and declare things authentic and declare things weak. And they are not known for knowledge and they did not learn knowledge and they are not from the narrators of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> nor from the Imaams of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>. So they are therefore, <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>; these lowly despicable folk. They stand up and they start speaking about the most dangerous thing, which is the science of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the knowledge of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared anyone who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>What is meant by <em>qiyaa<u>s</u></em> (analogy) here is <em>al-qiyaas ul-baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false analogy). As for <em>al-qiyaas u<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct analogy) then that is from the underlying fundamental evidences with the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, false analogy such as drawing analogy between the Creator and the creation or making analogy between a matter and another matter, which has no connection to it and does not have a common underlying factor. The like of that is false analogy. Because <em>al-qiyaas</em> (analogy) is joining a matter (<em>far·`a)</em> which we do not find a text for, joining it to a matter which there is a text for (<em>asl)</em> and so applying a ruling to it on account of there being an underlying factor (`<em>illah)</em>, common to both of them. So if there is no <em>`illah</em> (common underlying factor) common to both things then it will be a false and futile analogy.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Point Number 98 continued]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the ignorant, the inattentive and the ones having no knowledge entered into their saying. So therefore they entered into disbelief without knowing. And the <em>ummah</em> was ruined in a number of ways, committed disbelief in a number of ways, committed heresy in a number of ways and went astray in a number of ways and it split and innovated in a number of ways. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and what his companions were upon who did not go beyond what they had been upon and did not overstep their affair. Whatever sufficed them sufficed him and he did not wish to turn away from their way and their position. He knew that they were upon the correct Islaam and the correct true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>. So he followed them in his religion and found peace. And he knew that the religion lies in following; <em>taqleed</em> and that those who are meant to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the ignorant people, the inattentive ones and the one having no knowledge entered into their saying.” </strong></span>Meaning, the door was opened for everyone. They began speaking about the affairs of knowledge right until now as you know on account of these satellite channels and this speech and this chaos with regard to knowledge has reached the extent that the common masses of people speak about the matters of knowledge and they raise doubts about the matters of knowledge. They raise doubts about the Islamic rulings. They raise doubts about the verdicts of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as has preceded, they declare those who disagree with them to be disbelievers to the extent that they declare the earlier Imaams to be disbelievers and to being ignorant people and to the extent that some of them say, “I am a person and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal was a person. We are men and they were men. Maalik was a man and I am a man!” This is the level that the situation has reached with them that there is no special distinction for the saying of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“To the extent that they committed disbelief in a way which they did not know.”</span> </strong>They committed disbelief in a way that they did not know. So a person may say a saying of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and he does not know that it is a saying of disbelief on account of his being ignorant. So he says that which is disbelief and he promotes disbelief and he doesn’t even know that it is disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> on account of his having entered into something which he is not proficient in. So the danger is very great for him and for the nation (<em>ummah)</em>. If the danger were just restricted to him; the one who is speaking, it would be easier but the problem is that this spreads throughout the <em>ummah (</em>nation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>ummah</em> (nation) became ruined through a number of different ways and committed disbelief in a number of different ways,” </strong></span>meaning, they confused and deceived the <em>ummah</em> (nation) and they entered weaknesses into it until there came to be from them those people who adopt sayings of disbelief and they say, “<em>these are sayings of scholars</em>” just as they say about the saying of Al-Jahm and the Mu`tazilah to the extent that they write in the newspapers, then they say about the true scholars (`<em>ulemaa)</em>, “<em>you people, you restrict the truth to just yourselves and you throw away the sayings of the Imaams such as Ibn Seenaa and Ibn `Arabee and Al-Jahm Ibn <u>S</u>afwaan. And those people are scholars who have their value</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they committed heresy in different ways and went astray in different ways and they split and they innovated in different ways.” </strong></span>All of these calamities were on account of the ignorant people entering into the matters of knowledge and on account of having little fear of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So when they had very little fear of Allaah, they entered into these matters. And therefore one of the <em>Salaf</em> said: &#8220;<em>Their wara`(piety) was very slight so that is why they spoke</em>.” As for a person who fears Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then he doesn’t enter into anything if he is not proficient in it and not from its people, in particular the affairs of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and upon what his companions were upon and do not step beyond any of them.” </strong></span>They were not secure from these calamities, from disbelief and deviation and misguidance and diverting from the correct way and from mutual enmity and from cutting off ties with each other. No-one was safe from these calamities <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except</strong> </span>those who adhered to that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who are upon that which I and my companions are upon.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And who found sufficiency in whatever sufficed them,” </strong></span>and it is the Book and the Sunnah and that which the <em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h </u></em><u>(</u>the righteous predecessors) were upon, from the companions and the <em>taabi`een </em>and the most excellent generations and the Imaams. However, the problem lies in those people who say, “<em>They were men and we are men. And their speech has no distinction over our speech</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he knows that they were upon the correct Islaam and upon the correct <em>eemaan</em> (true faith).” </strong></span>Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the <em>Muhaajireen</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and those who followed them upon goodness.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever wants salvation then this is the path to it. And the one who does not want salvation will have whatever he chooses for himself but the harm is not restricted to him; rather, he will also carry the sins of the people along with his own sin. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لِيَحْمِلُوا أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۙ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they will carry their burdens of sin completely on the Day of Resurrection and they will carry from the sins of those whom they misled also without knowledge. Indeed what an evil burden they will bear! </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the companions and the most excellent generations are the ones who were upon correct Islaam and the correct religion. So how can you abandon them and go instead for those for whom there is no guarantee that he is upon the correct religion and that he is upon the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So this person followed them in his religion and was at peace.”</span> </strong><em>Qalladahum</em>; meaning he followed them, <em>ittaba-’ahum</em>.</p>
<p><strong> وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… and those who followed them upon good. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is <em>ittibaa</em>`; following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this person knows that the religion is just in following and that the ones to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong></span>As we have mentioned, what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is correct <em>taqleed</em>; following, which is <em>ittibaa`</em> just as Yusuf `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُون</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have left the religion of a people who do not truly believe in and worship Allaah alone and who deny the Hereafter. And I have followed the religious way of my forefathers; Ibraaheem and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yusuf (12), <em>aayah </em>37 and 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>` (following) of the righteous predecessors (<em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h)</u></em>, this is the truth and there is no blame at all for following them. Indeed blameworthiness is only for those who follow the people who are not deserving of being followed and who take as an example those who are not befitting to be taken as examples.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and by al-Bazzaar in his <em>Musnad</em> and by at-Ta<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Anas that he said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Before the Last Hour, there will be years of deception in which a liar will be believed and a truthful person will be taken to be a liar and in which a treacherous person will be trusted and in which a trustworthy person will be taken to be treacherous. And in it the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> will speak. So it was said, “Who are the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>?” So he said, “The little evil one who speaks about the public affairs.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafi<u>dh</u> ibn Katheer said in <em>an-Ni<u>h</u>aayah fil-Fitan w`al-Milaa<u>h</u>im</em>; its chain of narration is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for one of the verifiers of the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad; Shuayb al-Arna`ut, he said in his checking of the <em>Musnad</em> of A<u>h</u>mad, the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> is <em><u>h</u>asan</em>, this particular chain is weak as it contains Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin Is<u>h</u>aaq who is <em><u>h</u>asan</em> in <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> but he was a <em>mudallis</em> and he reports it here, he just says, “from”, he doesn’t say that he directly heard it from his Shaykh, he said, “from him”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an addition to what occurs here, this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> also occurs as a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Ibn Maajah (4,042) and by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad also and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (1,887) because it has a number of chains which support it. He also authenticates a <em>hadeeth</em> of Aws ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar wording, reported by al-Bazzaar and a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and he brings that in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aheehah</em> (2,253).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said, literally the beginning here that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the people of knowledge continue rebutting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until it was the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>,” </strong></span>he was here narrating the condition that was present and the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul Abbaas</em>, the beginning of it was upon good but then the affairs changed after the year 200 when the <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon accepted the call of the Mu`tazilah and became convinced that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created and he called the People of Knowledge to accept this innovation and to accept this saying, which is <em>kufr </em>(disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore fitnah; tremendous trial occurred, which continued from the year 200 onwards and for 12 years of the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon and Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and Al-Waathiq until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was taken on by Al-Mutawakkil `ala-Allaah and then the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> and the carriers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> had some respite then and it was the People of Falsehood who were then curbed of doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Al-Mutawakkil passed away, after that time then the <em>Khaleefas</em> began to lose their authority and the <em>Khilaafah</em> became just a name without any reality. They became an outer form without a true reality behind it and that was because the Turks gained ascendancy and they took hold of the reality of authority and came to actually control the <em>Khulafaa</em>·. They could bring whoever they wanted and appoint him and they could kill this one as they wished and then after that authority passed away from the Turkish people and passed to <em>Banu Booyaa</em>. [Translator’s side point: <em>Banu Booyaa</em> ruled roughly from the year 325 AH till about the year 450 AH.]. Then to <em>Al-Jaraakisaa</em> (the Circassians) until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was ended in the year 656.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the saying of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was realised that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“We are a people who used to be the most humiliated people but then Allaah gave us strength and honour through Islaam so whenever we seek to attain honour by other than that which Allaah gave us honour through, then Allaah will humiliate us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and he declared it authentic from `Umar and likewise Ath-<u>Th</u>ahabee agreed.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad finished by saying, “Except for the fact that the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al-Jamaa`ah</em> and the people of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the people of true `<em>aqeedah</em> have not ceased to be established upon their `<em>aqeedah</em>, not being harmed by whoever opposes them. And therefore, he (meaning the author; al-Barbahaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) therefore made an exception by saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his command what he was upon and his prohibition…”</strong></span> to the end of the saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Checking has preceded and the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as we had before was reported by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and al-<u>H</u>aakim and others and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> being part of the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of `Irbaa<u>d</u> ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and being declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> makes a point here, he said the point of slight objection to a wording, he said, the author’s saying here, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and you should know that the religion is just <em>taqleed</em>,” </strong></span>the point of objection is to be raised against here for the wording because <em>taqleed</em> means to follow without a proof. So if he had said the <em>deen</em> is <em>ittibaa</em>`; used this word, the religion is to follow the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> upon the understanding of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>ummah</em> from the companions and <em>taabi`een</em> and those who followed them upon good from the bearers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and narrations. This wording would’ve been what is correct because it conforms to what Allaah has commanded with in His Book when He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is My straight way so therefore follow it and do not follow the divergent paths, which will take you away from His path. He has enjoined you with that so that you are a people who are dutiful to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p><strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what is being sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any others besides Him in disobedience to Allaah. Little it is that you take admonition.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>`; following for the <em>Salaf</em>, those who were before us; upon the narration, upon proof, upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, this is the truth and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>..So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu so and so then the times changed. The people deteriorated greatly and innovations became widespread, and there came to be many callers to other than the way of the truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu (tribe) of so and so. Then the times changed greatly and innovations became widespread,” </strong></span>Differing increased and <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations; discord) increased after the excellent generations had passed away until there came the time of the `<em>Abbaasiyyeen</em>; the `Abbaasid Khaleefahs and Al-Ma`moon al-`Abbaasee appeared amongst them.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> And he was followed by Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and by Al-Waathiq and they adopted the saying of the <strong><em>Jahmiyyah</em></strong>; this deviant sect and they wanted to force the people of the Sunnah upon the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And they killed some of the <em>Imaams</em> and they lashed others from them. However, the truth remains firm and all praise is for Allaah; it does not depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the callers to other than the way of the truth and of the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> became many.&#8221; </strong></span>Many people today say that they are <em>du</em>`<em>aat</em> (callers) and that they are <em>Jama`aat</em> (groups) and there are sects beneath this cover of <em>da`wah</em> (calling); being <em>du`aat</em> (callers) and what they want is to call the people to misguidance except for those whom Allaah has mercy upon from those who remain upon the call to the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology; way of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his call. Then this one is upon truth and this is the call of truth. Not everyone who carries the name of giving <em>da`wah</em> will be correct until his methodology (<em>manhaj)</em> is looked into, the methodology, which he precedes upon. So if he precedes upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, then he is a caller to truth. And if he is contrary to that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was upon in the methodology of <em>da`wah</em> then he is upon <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (falsehood). So a person should not be deceived by someone saying that he is from the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) for indeed there are <em>du`aat</em> (callers) who are at the gates of the Hellfire and whoever obeys them, they will throw him into it just as he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> And therefore, the author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“</strong><strong>and there became many callers to other than the way of truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.” </strong></span>Just as is the case now. There are many who claim that they are calling to Islaam underneath this cover. So if their <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) is looked into and their activities then they are found to be in total opposition to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And trials came about with regard to everything, which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> had not spoken about nor anyone from his companions </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em></strong><strong> (may Allaah be pleased with them). </strong></span>Speech became plentiful and differing and rumour mongering and claims of knowledge. However, all of this will fade into insignificance and what is indicated by the Book and the Sunnah will remain and it is the sound methodology and the straight path. However, this requires two matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>Al-`ilmu-Naafi’</em>: Beneficial Knowledge; <em>`ilm</em> by which that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions and those who followed them upon good were upon.</li>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> <em>As-<u>S</u>abaru Wath-Thabaat</em>: Patience and firmness and that you do not move away; depart along with the discord; trials and tribulations or along with the callers to misguidance. Rather, that you should be <em>thaabit</em> (firm) and be patient upon whatever strikes you from rebukes and blame or threats. As long as you are upon the truth then be patient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>وَاصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا أَصَابَكَ ۖ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have patience upon whatever befalls you. Indeed that is from those affairs which Allaah has firmly commanded. </strong></span>(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He said within that <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I said, so will there be any evil after this good?” So he </strong><em><strong><u>s</u></strong><strong>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</strong></em><strong> said, “Yes, there will be callers at the gates of the Hellfire, whoever responds to them in that, they will cause him to be cast into it.” He said, “I said, O Messenger of Allaah, describe them to us.” So he said, “They have our skin and they speak with our tongue.” So, I say, “What do you command me if that reaches me?” He said, “That you adhere to the united body of the Muslims upon the truth and to their ruler.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 32 &amp; 33 : Point 42</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وكل ما سمعت من الآثار شيئا مما لم يبلغه عقلك نحو قول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قلوب العباد بين إصبعين من أصابع الرحمن عز وجل وقوله إن الله ينزل إلى السماء الدنيا وينزل يوم عرفة وينزل يوم القيامة وإن جهنم لا يزال يطرح فيها حتى يضع عليها قدمه جل ثناؤه وقول الله تعالى للعبد إن مشيت إلي هرولت إليك وقوله خلق الله آدم على صورته وقول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأيت ربي في أحسن صورة وأشباه هذه الأحاديث فعليك بالتسليم والتصديق والتفويض والرضا ولا تفسر شيئا من هذه بهواك فإن الإيمان بهذا واجب فمن فسر شيئا من هذا بهواه ورده فهو جهمي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And whenever you hear something from the narrations, which your intellect cannot fully comprehend such as the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and His saying:</span>  <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allaah descends to the lowest heaven and He descends on the Day of `Arafah and He will descend on the Day of Resurrection and that the Hellfire will continue to have people cast into it until He, the Majestic and Praise will place His foot upon it”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and the saying of Allaah the Most High to the servant: </span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“if you come towards Me walking, I will comes towards you running.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His saying <strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon His image.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the most excellent form” </strong></span><span style="color:#993300;">and the like of these <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then upon you is to submit and to believe and to consign the how to Allaah and to be pleased and do not explain anything from this based upon your desires since having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory so whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a <em>Jahmee</em>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-attributes-of-allaah-the-creed-of-ahlus-sunnah-wal-jamaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts of the <em>sifaat</em> (attributes) that are established for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them just as they come upon their reality without interfering with them with your intellect and saying this does not befit Allaah. Allaah is declared free of that and this is resemblance; <em>tashbeeh</em>, as is said by the <em>Mu’attilah</em>; deniers of the attributes or that you believe that Allaah resembles His creation as is said by the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who declare the Creator to be like the creation. So each of the two groups are upon misguidance.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Mu`attilah</em>;</strong> those who deny the attributes, they went beyond the limit in <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Allaah free) to such an extent that they denied the names and attributes in order to flee away from <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) they claimed.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mumaththilah</em>;</strong> those who liken Allaah to the creation, they went beyond the limit in affirming to such an extent that they likened Allaah to His creation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">Both of these positions are <em>baatil</em> (false and futile).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the position of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is <em>al-wasa<u>t</u></em> (the middle and justly balanced position), they affirm the names and attributes for Allaah with affirmation without <em>tashbeeh</em> (without likening Allaah to the creation) and they negate from Him any resemblance to a created being declaring Him free of imperfections but without denying the attributes. This is the position of the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah W`al Jama`ah</em>. In accordance with His saying He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who liken Allaah to the creation, <strong>“there is nothing like Him.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He, Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mu`attilah</em>; those who deny the attributes and the <em>aayah</em> proves that affirming the names and attributes does not necessitate <em>tashbeeh </em>(resemblance) to the creation nor <em>tamtheel </em>(His being like) the creation and the fact that the people affirm whatever attributes He has affirmed for Himself or His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, we affirm those attributes and that in no way necessitates that we have likened Him to the creation or declared Him to be resemblance to the creation. This is the correct methodology with regard to the matter of <em>Al-Asma Wa-Sifaat</em> (names and the attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like such as <strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> you should affirm <em>a<u>s</u>aabi`</em> (the fingers) for the Most Merciful as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth and you should not say that they are like the fingers of the created being for this is <em>tashbeeh</em> (likening) Him to the creation, we declare Allaah free of it. Rather, we affirm it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High not like the fingers of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we affirm the <em><u>H</u>adeeth Qudsee</em> in which Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever comes to me walking, I come to him running.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning whoever hastens towards My pleasure and towards obedience to Me then I will hasten to forgive his sins and to carry out his needs. so the meaning of <em>harwalah</em> (running) is not the meaning that is well-known with us but rather it is explained by the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth by His saying, <strong>“If he were to ask Me, I would certainly give to him and if he were to ask My refuge, I would certainly grant him refuge.” </strong>So, the meaning of <em>al-harwalah</em> here is hastening to carry out the needs of His servant just as the servant hastens to the obedience to Allaah. So, does the servant run in reality or in meaning?<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains a refutation of some of those who are overhasty in affirming <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) for Allaah and this is the case of actions which are done as a response just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ ۙ سَخِرَ اللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So they (the disbelievers) mock at the believers, Allaah will mock at them.</span></strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah</em> 79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ</p>
<p>اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the hypocrites) say, “We were only mocking.” Allaah will mock them.</span></strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 14-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plotted and Allaah planned.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 154)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to have awareness of these tremendous principles so that a person may be upon clear insight and be aware of the position of the <em><strong>Salaf</strong> </em>with regard to it; those who are more firmly grounded than you and had more knowledge than you and a person should not try and make himself independent with his own understanding and his own intellect and affirm for Allaah things that he does not know about based upon what is apparent or based upon some unclear things, when there are decisive evidences, which explain and clarify them. So, it is obligatory to refer that which is unclear back to that which is clear and only those who are firmly grounded in knowledge will be guided to doing this. So, it is obligatory upon the student of knowledge and the beginner that he should not be hasty in these matters. Rather, he should withhold with regard to them and he should learn how he is to understand them upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf </em>and upon the clear, correct way. The <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) did not fall short in making the truth clear and in laying down principles and regulations. However, this requires learning and understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this also is his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And He descends on the evening of Arafah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they but await that Allaah should come to them screened by clouds and the angels come and the affair will be finished and to Allaah return all affairs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise with regard to Allaah, the Most High’s coming on the Day of Resurrection, it occurs also as a side point in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection to carry out judgement upon His servants.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We affirm these matters for Allaah upon their reality (<em><u>h</u>aqeeqah)</em> without interfering by defining the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). So, we do not burden ourselves with awareness of how He will descend and how He will come. So, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how), we do not enter into it but as for the meaning then it is <em>ma’qool</em> (understood) and therefore, when Imaam Maalik was asked about how <em>al-istiwaa</em>; how the ascending is when the questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner said to Imaam Maalik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“How did He ascend?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asking about <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said to him:</p>
<p><strong>الاستواء معلوم</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ascending is known.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning known with regard to its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik said:</p>
<p><strong>والكيف مجهول , والإيمان به واجب , والسؤال عنه بدعة</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And how is unknown and having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking about it is bid’ah (innovation).” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the sound methodology in the like of these affairs.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">soorah</span></em> (a form) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic in his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon his image.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Upon the form of the Most Merciful one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we affirm <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (a form or image) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic just as His Messenger affirmed it for Him in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the best form.”</strong></span> <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e this was in the world seeing Him in a dream in the best form. It contains affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (form or image) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High as befits His Majesty, not like the images of the created beings but rather, it is the <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (image or form) of the Most Merciful, the Majestic and Most High. So, these matters, we affirm them and we do not enter into them nor raise doubts about them nor delve further into them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>We consign or surrender the matter,” </strong>what is correct is to perform <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the <em>kayfiyyah</em></span> (how) it is, not <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Do not explain anything from these with your desires,”</strong> rather you must explain them with the correct meaning that befits Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. It should not be said that they are not to be explained. Rather, they are to be explained and their meaning is to be made clear and <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (surrender, consigning) is just with regard to how only. So, therefore you affirm <em>an-nuzool</em> (His descending) but you negate the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High comes on the Day of Resurrection to carry out the judgement just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah comes to them screened by clouds and the angels and the affair is concluded.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect will come to carry out judgement upon His servants. However, it is not like the coming of the created being and the coming of one of the creation. Rather, it is coming as befits His Majesty however He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>You should not explain any of this <em>Bi Hawaaka</em> (with your desires),” </strong>meaning do not explain them without knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> but as for your explaining them as necessitated by the evidences and referring that which is unclear back to that which is clear then there is no harm in it. But as for a person who is a beginner or an ignorant person then he should not enter into these very grave matters and these tremendous matters because this is a mistake and something very dangerous and I see many of the youth who feign knowledge being bold upon the matters of <em>`aqeedah</em> and they start to derive things from them and to speak about them and then they have enmity towards each other based upon these things and they break ties with each other when they disagree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, oh brothers, Allaah did not burden us with these matters. Upon you is to proceed upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf</em> and to say what they said. The books of <em>`aqeedah</em> are precisely written and all praise is for Allaah and printed and corrected and being studied and carefully checked so do not introduce things from yourselves and understandings from yourselves, you have been  sufficed having to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory,”</strong> having <em>eemaan</em> in the names of Allaah and attributes and His actions is obligatory. It is obligatory upon the servant and from having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is to have <em>eemaan</em> in His names and His attributes as befits His Majesty, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, the person who interferes in the matters of names and attributes, either with <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation) or with <em>tamtheel </em>(likening the Creator to the creation) or with <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (claiming ignorance about the meaning) or by bringing explanation from himself then this person has not believed in Allaah with true and full <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, his <em>eemaan</em> is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>So, whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a Jahmee,” </strong>the Jahmiyyah negated the names and attributes because they explain them in accordance with what befits the created being. There is no doubt that Allaah is declared free of that which befits the created being. So, they <strong>initially</strong> likened Him and then <strong>secondly</strong>, they negated based upon their <em>tamtheel</em> (having likened Him to the creation) since nothing was apparent to them from these texts except that which resembles the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore they denied them on account of that but as for if they had just said these texts contain attributes and names of Allaah in reality, that they are as befit Him, they are not like the names of the created beings nor like the attributes of the created beings, if they’d just followed this methodology, they would have been safe and sound but they were afflicted on account of their understanding and their desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Jahmiyyah, this is an ascription to Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan at-Tirmidhiyy or As-Samar Qandee, this well-known deviant, ascribed to the town of Tirmidh or the area of Samar Qand and he was the first one who manifested the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created and who had the saying that the names and the attributes are to be negated and who said that <em>eemaan</em> is just merely awareness in the heart to the rest of his sayings of misguidance and disbelief. So, whoever holds this belief then he is ascribed to him or it is to be said this person is a Jahmee in ascription to Al-Jahm.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Part of a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (2,654) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (7,405) and Muslim (2,675) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Whether <em>ar-harwalah</em> (running) is to be understood literally or it’s to be explained as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned in the likes of what occurs at the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth then as Shaykh al-Fowzaan <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, <span style="font-size:1rem;">This is also what was said by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Majmoo` al-Fataawa</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> and likewise you’ll find in the explanation of Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh upon </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> of Ibn Taymeeyah, the same explanation, he explained it that here in this particular hadeeth </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">al-harwalah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> means </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;">Allaah, the Most High’s hastening to carry out the needs of His servant and to forgive him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are others from the People of Knowledge who affirm <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) as an attribute for Allaah, the Most High as is apparent. From them was Imaam Ad-Daranee in his refutation of Al-Mareesee. Likewise, from the present day scholars Shaykh bin Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his <em>fataawa</em>; <em>Fataawa Noor `Alaa al-Darb</em>. Likewise, Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen in his fataawa and in his fataawa of al-`aqeedah in his book <em>Al-Qawaa`id al-Muthlaa</em> and Shaykh `Ubayd in his explanation, he agreed with that as well. Likewise, the <em>Saudi Lajna</em> also and likewise, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em>Silsilatul Huda Wan-Noor</em> tape series, all of them affirming this as an attribute for Allaah as befits His Majesty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation &#8211; &#8220;So, the <em>Salaf</em> had a great deal of speech concerning it, however, what has most right in the matter is that we should have eemaan in it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, meaning we affirm it as an attribute for Allaah as it stands and it is a proof for His responding to His creation, we affirm the attribute and what’s necessitated by the attribute is that Allaah indeed responds to His creation. So what is indicated by the attribute and its affect is His reward. So affirming the attribute <em>ar-harwalah</em> has more right than the saying of those who say that it means giving reward alone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (6,321) and Muslim (758) from Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Reported by Muslim (1,348) from `Aa`ishah that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no day when Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the day of Arafah and He indeed draws close then He boasts about them to the angels and says “what do those people want?”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (806) and Muslim (182), a long <u>h</u>adeeth containing the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And Allaah will come to them, He, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come and the angels in ranks.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> in his explanation mentioned a number of attributes and he applied the same principle to each one with regard to Allaah’s hand for example, he says, “The hand the meaning is known, the how is unknown, having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking how is an innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (6,227) and reported by Muslim (2,841) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> Reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer</em> and by Al-Haarith ibn `Abee Usaamah in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Ibn Khuzaymah in <em>Kitaab at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and it was declared authentic by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahaweyh as occurs in <em>Meezaan al-I’tidaal</em> of Imaam a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>Th</u>ahabiyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge such as Ibn Khuzaymah and some others declare this wording to be weak and likewise Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared this wording weak in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em>, <u>h</u>adeeth number 1,176 because of four weaknesses in the chain of narration. Ibn Khuzaymah himself pointed out three of the weaknesses and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentions the 4<sup>th</sup> weakness as well, Allaahu `Aalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and it should be volume 5, page 243 and by At-Tirmidhiyy in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mu`aadh <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it was declared authentic by At-Tirmidhiyy and he mentioned Al-Bukhaariyy declared it authentic also and likewise it was declared  <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> <strong>Side Point:</strong> The position of the People of the Sunnah is with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High then we say just as Imaam Maalik said as for the meaning of the attributes then we affirm the meaning but as regards to how the attribute is then we do not know so that is what we consign to Allaah, we give up on that, how it is; we do not know, we leave that to our Lord, Allaahu `Aalam. Whereas, as regards to the <em>Mufawwidah</em>; the deviant group then they  do the <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning i.e  they say we don’t know what the meaning is.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58] (continued from Lesson 16)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) except the people of innovation such as the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> – those who negate the <em>ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen by the believers). They say: This (affirming seeing Allaah) would necessitate that Allaah is in a direction (جهة &#8211; <em>jihah</em>). And it is their view that Allaah is not in a direction; and in their view He is not within the creation, nor is He outside it, nor is He above, nor is He below, nor is He to the right, nor is He to the justify; He is not in any direction. And the meaning of this is that He does not exist, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  So, they deny seeing Allaah because of this futile opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>A<u>sh</u>aa`irah</em>, when they were not able to deny the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah then they affirmed seeing Allaah, but they said: He will be seen, but not in any direction. And this is an amazing contradiction! Because, there is nothing that is seen which is not in a direction; and therefore the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> refuted them for this because it is something impossible. Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> (the people of the Sunnah), they say: He the Perfect and Most High will be seen and He is in the direction of <em>al-`uloo</em> (العلو – being elevated) and above them. Because the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (الجهة – direction), if what is meant by it is a direction within the creation, then in that sense Allaah is not in any such direction because Allaah is not incarnate within His creation, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if what is meant by it, is that He is Exalted and above all of the creation then this is something confirmed for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, Allaah is indeed Exalted and High above the heavens. So the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (direction) is neither affirmed nor denied directly in text. However, it can be spoken of with the previous details.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <strong>“…without their encompassing Him and without saying how”</strong>: They cannot encompass Allaah the Mighty and Majestic; they will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. And Allaah is <em>A<u>z</u>eem</em> (عظيم – Tremendous); it is not possible that He can be encompassed. He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And they do not encompass Him in Knowledge</em></span> (Soorah <u>T</u>aaHaa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot grasp Him</span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: sight cannot encompass Him; it doesn’t mean that He cannot be seen, because Allaah the Perfect and Most High did not say, “Sight will not see Him (لا تراه الأبصار).” Rather, He said, “<strong>Sight will not grasp Him</strong>.” So, reaching and grasping is something and <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing) is something else. So sight will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. So this contains a refutation of those who seek to use this <em>aayah</em> as a proof to deny <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen) – those who say that seeing Allaah is not possible, saying: because Allaah said, “<strong>Sight will not encompass Him.</strong>” So we say to them: You do not know the meaning of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight </span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>aayah,</em> “<strong>Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight,</strong>” its meaning is: He will not be encompassed by that. It doesn’t mean that He won’t be seen; and He the Perfect did not say: “Sight will not see Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they also use as evidence, saying: Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Lord, show me Yourself, let me look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me.”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They say) this is a proof negating <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say to them: This refers to this world because Moosaa asked for that in this world and no one will see Allaah in this world – neither any Prophet nor anyone else. But as for in the Hereafter, then the believers will certainly see their Lord. And the conditions in the world are not the same as the conditions in the Hereafter. So the people in this world are weak in their bodies and weak in their senses; they are not able to see Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. But as for in the Hereafter, then Allaah will give them the ability by which they will be able to see their Lord, the Majestic and Most High, (He would give this) as an honour for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, when Moosaa asked his Lord in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He said, “You will not see Me; however, look at the mountain and if it remains in its place then you shall see Me.” So when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He caused it to shatter to dust. </span></em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountain shattered and turned to dust; and the mountain is inanimate and solid, so how about the created being who is composed of flesh and blood and bones? He is not able to see Allaah in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this question that Moosaa asked, to see Allaah, is a proof that it is permissible to see Him and possible (to see Him); because Moosaa would not ask his Lord for anything which is not permissible. Rather, he asked Him for something which is permissible; but, it would not occur in this world. So therefore, Allaah the Perfect said, “<strong>You will not see Me,</strong>” and He did not say “I cannot be seen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed be seen in the Hereafter,[2] and those who have the most right to this seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) are the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And we do not say how this will be</strong>” meaning: it is not to be said, “How will they see Allaah?” because this is just like the rest of the Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – we do not know how they are. So, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them (we believe in them) and we know their meaning and we affirm them. However, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (كيفية– how they are) is unknown; we do not know it. So Allaah knows better about that, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> End of explanation of point [58] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[59]     Just as is stated by the Book of our Lord: “On that Day some faces will be radiant, shining, looking at their Lord.” (Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75) <em>aayaat</em> 22-3).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clearly states that it is looking upon Allaah with sight since the term for ‘looking’ is used with <em>ilaa</em> (إلى – the particle ‘towards’). So its meaning is ‘looking with sight’. Whereas the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say: ﭽ ﭝ  ﭞﭼ <em>‘ilaa’</em> (إلى) here is a plural and it means ‘blessings’; so (they say) it means: ‘they will be looking at the Blessings of their Lord’ and this is foolish delusion which people of intellect would laugh at since a particle doesn’t become plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60] وتَفْسيرُهُ عَلى ما أرادَهُ اللهُ تَعالَى وَعَلِمَه‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60]     And its explanation is as Allaah the Most High, wanted and knew.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the explanation of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking upon their Lord </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (its explanation) is just as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic wanted, and that is that it means ‘seeing with sight’. Its explanation is not as the innovators want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61] وكلُّ ما جاءَ في ذَلِكَ مِنَ الحديثِ الصَّحيحِ عَنِ الرسولِ صلَّى الله عليه وآله وسلَّم فهو كما قال‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61]     And every authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported from the Messenger, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em> (may Allaah extol him and his true followers and grant him perfect peace and security), then it is just as he said.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: everything reported from the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> affirming that Allaah will be seen, then it is true upon its reality – just the same as what occurs in the Qur.aan. It is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> in it because it is the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>which is <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he (the Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) does not speak from his own desires; it is just revelation inspired. </span></em>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it (the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is called ‘the second Revelation’. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed in many <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people) that the believers would see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in that, without <em>ta<u>h</u>reef </em>(تحريف – altering the meaning) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل – negating) and without <em>tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (تمثيل<em> – </em>likening Him to His creation) and without <em>takyeef</em> (تكييف<em> – </em>saying ‘how’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62] وَمَعناهُ على ما أرادَ‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62]     And its meaning is as He intended.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: as the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended (when he said it), not as those innovators and deviants intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [62][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In Shaykh Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen’s abridgement of Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah, Talqees Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah (تلخيص الحموية) of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, he mentioned a point right near the beginning, which was: that the people of the Sunnah in affirming Allaah’s Attributes, (first principle:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we affirm for Allaah whatever He affirmed for Himself or whatever His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> affirmed for Him, (second principle:) and we deny/negate for Allaah whatever He negated for Himself or the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>negated for Him. Thirdly, where there is something that is not denied in text, nor is it affirmed in text, from those things which the people disagree about, such as the term ‘a body’ (جسم – <em>j</em><em>ism</em>) or ‘<em>al-<u>h</u>eez</em>’ (being in a place) and ‘<em>al-jihah’</em> (being in a direction) and the like of that, then their way (the people of the Sunnah) is <em>at-tawaqquf</em> – to stop and withhold with regard to its wording. So they don’t affirm its wording and they don’t deny it since it is not reported. And as for its meaning, then we ask for the detail of what is meant by it, and if we find that what is meant by it is something futile and false – something which Allaah is declared free of, then we reject it; and if what is meant by it is something true – something which is not prohibited for Allaah, then we accept it. This is their way and this is the obligatory way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on in the book (page 45) he actually goes into detail about <em>al-jihah. </em>He mentioned that the later people brought this term up (<em>al-jihah</em> – direction) and he deals with it in this way i.e. if what they mean is a direction within the creation then we deny that for Allaah and if what they mean by that is that Allaah is above the heavens, then we affirm that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] On the authority of Aboo Moosaa Al-A<u>sh</u>`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْنٍ‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>“There will be two gardens containing silver – their utensils and whatever they contain, and two gardens of gold &#8211; their utensils and whatever they contain, and nothing will be between the people in the eternal garden and their looking upon their Lord, except the cloak of rightful pride upon His Face.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in the Book of <em>Tafseer</em>, <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 4878 and 4880 and reported by Muslim in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made a fairly small point on this point here. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know that the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported affirming the believers seeing their Lord on the Day of Resurrection are very many – to the extent that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> as has been clearly stated by a group of the <em>imaams</em>. From them, the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz), and he mentioned some of them and then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about the <em>ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) are reported by around thirty companions and whoever acquired comprehensive knowledge of them will state with certainty that the Messenger (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) definitely said it and if I had not put it upon myself to write this book in abridged form, then I would quote more of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> </em>here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, “The declaration that seeing Allaah the Most High will be like seeing the Sun and the Moon is not <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (تشبيه) of Allaah (causing Allaah to resemble His creation). Rather, it is a statement that the ‘act’ of seeing is like ‘that’ act of seeing – not that the One seen is like the thing which is seen. However, it does contain an evidence that Allaah is above His creation; since, can any seeing be comprehended without facing? And as for those people who say, ‘He will be seen, but not in a direction,’ then this person should look back and check his own intellect because either he is opposing obstinately his correct intellect or his intellect has got something wrong with it. Or otherwise a person saying, ‘He will be seen but He will not be in front, He will not be behind, He will not be to the right, He will not be to the justify, He will not be above and He will not be below;’ (then this is not correct) anyone who hears this, whose nature is sound, then he will reject it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: And as for His, He the Most High, being seen in this world, then the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said in the authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that none of us will see Him until he dies. <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim. And as for him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then there is nothing reported to affirm that he even saw his Lord. Indeed, there is something authentic from him which indicates a denial of this because when he was asked about this he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">نور، أنى أراه</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Meaning:  <span style="color:#339966;"> “Light, how could I see Him”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And along with this, the noble lady `Aa.ishah (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>) clearly denied this (that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw his Lord) as occurs in the two <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>’s; and that is the basic principle which we cling to.”</p>
