<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The following is posted from Riyadus Saliheen Published by Dar-us-Salam</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;One of the earlier Prophets who was out on an expedition proclaimed among his people that no man should follow him who had married a woman with whom he wished to cohabit but had not yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the roofs, or who had bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and was expecting them to produce young. He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man&#8217;s hand stuck to his, he said: &#8220;There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me&#8221;. (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: &#8220;The thief is among you&#8221;. They brought him a head of gold like a cow&#8217;s head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Commentary</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1. In the opinion of Imam As-Suyuti, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) referred to in this Hadith was Prophet Yusha` bin Nun (Joshua). His conduct shows that it is necessary to make suitable arrangements for the worldly needs of those who are engaged in the Cause of Allah so that they can concentrate on their struggle without any distraction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2. The lawfulness of the booty of war fought in the way of Allah is a specialty of the Muslim Ummah. Before the advent of Islam (the Shar&#8217;iah of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)), the booty of war which was free from dishonesty used to be consumed by fire. This Hadith also confirms the miracle of the Prophet Yusha&#8217; (Joshua) in which the movement of the sun was stopped until he had conquered the village.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">As sallamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago (13<sup>th</sup> Ramadaan), in the masjid of the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi  wa sallam</i>) in Medina, in his explanation of Usool-us-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad, Sheikh Saaleh bin Sa’d as-Suhaymee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“My brothers, do not forget your brothers in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and in every place in your supplications because of these well-known conspiracies which have been agreed upon by all from amongst the disbelievers from the Jews and the Christians, the hizb-ul-Iblees (the party of Iblees), the Raafidah and other than them. They are agreed upon in concocting these conspiracies to divert the Muslims away from Tawheed and to put them to trial and so that they can reach their goals of completely eradicating the Muslims of Ahlus-Sunnah. </b><b><br>
</b></span><br>
<span style="color:#008000;"> <b>However, they will bring in loss (upon themselves) – by the permission of Allah – whether it is the Jews and the Christians of the west and the east, or the party of Iblees, or the Raafidah or those who conspire with them against Ahlus-Sunnah, or the Khawaarij or other than them. All of these (groups) will come to an end – by the permission of Allah. Every time a tentacle from amongst them appears, it will be cut off, and Allah will cut off their tentacles – by the permission of Allah, The Most High&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then stressed the importance of the Muslims returning back to Allah and to have reliance upon Him alone. He mentioned how the day before someone in Gaza had even called upon Salaah-ud-Deen al-Ayubee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) to help them and that this is the very essence of Shirk. The Sheikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“How do you expect to be rescued (from these trials) whilst you are calling upon other than Allah?”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then advised the Muslims to call upon Allah alone and not upon anyone else, including the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi wa sallam</i>). He then supplicated for the destruction of all these groups, whether it is the ‘devils’ of the Khawaarij and The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, or the ‘devils’ of the Jews and the Christians in the east and the west or the ‘devils’ of the Raafidah or the hizb of Iblees. He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“&#8230;By Allah, the Jews and the Christians and the west and the east are not the enemies of the Raafidah. They are not the enemies of the Khawaarij. They are the ones who brought them in, they are the ones who armed them and they are the ones who sold weapons to them. This is because the goal which they have in mind is to completely eradicate Ahlus-Sunnah, the Salafees, Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jammah. However, they will bring in loss, failure and disappointment (upon themselves) by the permission of Allah, The Most Merciful&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transcription of the Sheikh’s words can be found at:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah save the Muslims from the conspiracies of the Jews and Christians, the Raafidah and the Khawaarij. Aameen.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh AbdusSallaam bin Salim bin Raja’ as-Suhaymee</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdusSallaam as-Suhaymee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the issue of speaking about Suicide missions, is that whether the person who is fought against, is he actually from the combatants, and that <em>Jihad</em> in reality is facing the <em>Kuffar</em> in  a battle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suicide Missions have become a modern day fashion, and many people are sympathetic with the one who carries it out by looking at the goal behind these missions.  The sympathetic person finds it sufficient from these missions that the intent of executing these missions is to raise the statement of <em>Tawheed</em>, and to aid Islaam and humble the<em>Kuffar</em> as they claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is the <em>Sharia’</em> ruling regarding these Suicide Missions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Ends Do not Justify the Means]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is known from the <em>Sharia’</em> that a good intention on its own is not sufficient to allow an action to be permissible according to the <em>Sharia’</em>.  These people, who carry out Suicide Missions, propel themselves by saying that the means to the end take the same rulings of the intended goals, so if the goal is legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> then its means are also legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em>.  However this is not acceptable, because the ends do not justify the means absolutely, rather it is obligatory that the means also have to be legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> to fulfill the goals in the <em>Sharia’</em>.  As for, if the means are not legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> then it is not sufficient for the goal to be legislated.  The principle for this is mentioned in Bukhari and Muslim from the saying of the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ( من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action which is not in accordance with the command of Allaah or His Messenger then it is rejected (Allaah does not accept it) from the one who does it, no matter how good his intention was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now that this point has been established, then indeed the well regarded scholars of today hold the view that these acts of suicide are not permissible, and from these scholars are: the respected Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Baz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>, and the noble Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen, the respected Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Abdullaah Alaa-Shaykh, the noble Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan, and Shaykh AbdulAzeez ar-Rajihi, and Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Ubaykan and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sharia’</em> proofs from the Book and the Sunnah and the intellect, show that these operations are <em>Haram</em> according to the <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Book of Allaah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  إِنْ يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ الْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِثْلُهُ وَتِلْكَ الْأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ النَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنْكُمْ شُهَدَاءَ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الظَّالِمِينَ   &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allaah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allaah likes not the <em>Zâlimûn </em>(polytheists and wrong­doers).&gt;&gt;[Ala-Imraan: 140]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being: that this <em>Ayaah</em> contains the evidence for a principle, which is, that seeking martyrdom in the path of Allaah is a selection made by Allaah and the choice of Allaah Subhanahu, and it is not for everyone who wants to be a martyr. The view that it is permissible to carry out suicide missions to kill the enemy nullifies this principle. The proof for this point in this <em>Ayaah</em> is the saying of Allaah Subhanahu: &lt;&lt; آمَنُوا وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنْكُمْ شُهَدَاءَ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;and that He may take martyrs from among you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the One who chooses who is martyred in His Way. As for the one who commits suicide to kill the enemy then he is not a martyr, because he himself has appointed the time in  which to die, and this in the <em>Sharia’</em> is defined as suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, Allaah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties; for the price that theirs shall be Paradise. They fight in Allaah’s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. &gt;&gt; [Tawbah:111]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَوْ يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;and whoso fights in the Cause of Allaah, and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being from these two <em>Ayaat</em>: that the one who kills himself with explosives or in other ways wanting to kill the enemy then it is not correct to label him as a martyr;<strong>because the martyr is the one who is killed by the enemy. </strong>In the first <em>Ayaah</em>those that have been promised Paradise are two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The combatant and the one killed by the enemy. And in the second <em>Ayaah</em>: the one promised with great reward is the one who is killed by the enemy or the one who is victorious, however whoever kills himself with explosives does not enter under the meaning of these two <em>Ayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا () وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ عُدْوَانًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:29-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being: This <em>Ayaah</em> generally includes a person committing suicide, and these type of suicide operations include killing the innocent, from women, old people and children, and there is no doubt that this is from transgression and oppression, and the one who carries out a suicide mission is deserving of this severe warning and it applies to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Sunnah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From Abu Huraira &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu- </em>who said: That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قتل نفسه بحديدة فحديدته في يده يتوجأ بها في بطنه في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا و من شرب سما فقتل نفسه فهو يتحساه في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا و من تردى من جبل فقتل نفسه فهو يتردى في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever jumps off a mountain and kills himself, he will be jumping off into the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From Thaabit bin Dhihak that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قتل نفسه بشيء عذب به يوم القيامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever kills himself with something  then he will be punished with that thing on the day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- From Abu Huraira &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu- </em>who said: That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الذي يخنق نفسه يخنقها في النار و الذي يطعنها يطعنها في النار</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever strangles himself then he will strangle himself in the Hell-Fire, and whoever stabs himself then he will stab himself in the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being from these <em>Ahadeeth</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That these <em>Ahadeeth</em> generally show that it is prohibited for a person to kill himself no matter what the reasons are, and this includes everyone that kills himself with whichever means used.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Intellect:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That these operations indeed bring a backlash with a greater evil consequence upon Islaam and the Muslims, whether that is in Palestine or in any other place.  These operations in reality show contempt and scorn of the blood of the Muslims, and sacrifices for these operations are with no benefit worth mentioning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- That these operations actually <strong>fulfill the aims of the enemies of Islaam</strong> in an indirect way, by giving the enemies of Islaam the excuse by which they have fulfilled their aims in the easiest way, along with the clear weakness of the Muslims in defending themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- That these suicide missions which are aimed at other than those who are combatants from women, children and old people are a deterrent against the  <em>Deen</em> of Allaah, because of the oppression of these suicide missions and their harshness, cheating, treachery, lying and all of these are contradictory to the <em>Sharia’</em> of Islaam, all of them are contradictory and the explanation of that is from the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First point: that the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is the <em>Deen</em> of justice even in dealing with the enemy, so their oppression against the Muslims does not in turn justify oppressing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَنْ صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَنْ تَعْتَدُوا وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from <em>Al-­Masjid­ al-­Haraam </em>(in Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help one another in <em>Al-­Birr </em>and <em>At-­Taqwa </em>(virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment.&gt;&gt; [Maidah:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Well­Acquainted with what you do.&gt;&gt; [Maidah:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the Hadeeth <em>Qudsi</em> that Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O My worshippers, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.’ [Collected by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that aiming for innocent people and killing them due to the crime of someone else is from the severest of <em>Dhulm</em> (oppression).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second point: that the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is the <em>Deen</em> of mercy and doing goodness, and this is not just to human beings alone, but even to animals, and these suicide missions are in contradiction to mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third point: That the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is a <em>Deen</em> of courage and sacrifice, and it is not courage to hide behind treachery and deception. Indeed Allaah ordered us at the inception of fighting a people, between whom we have a contract with or at the time we fear from them an action, Allaah ordered us to give them an announcement of war before launching war against them.  Allaah – Subhanahu – said: &lt;&lt; وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِنْ قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَانْبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَى سَوَاءٍ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْخَائِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;If you fear treachery from any people throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms (that there will be no more covenant between you and them). Certainly Allaah likes not the treacherous.&gt;&gt; [Anfal:58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah obligated upon us that even in war with them that we do not kill except those who fight us from amongst their men. And these people who carryout suicide missions commit a great crime against Islaam and the Muslims, so they ascribed Islaam to oppression, treachery and cheating. Islaam is not aided with oppression nor with cheating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What becomes clear from what has preceded, from the clear, authentic evidence that suicide operations are not allowed, which some have entitled: ‘martyr missions’ and that those who hold it to be permissible do not have any clear authentic proof what so ever, and what they use as proof for its permissibility is either a proof which is not authentic or it does not indicate to what they claim, and no one rejects this point except an ignorant person or someone who follows his desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken From: ‘Jihad fee Islaam’ by Shaykh AbdusSallaam as-Suhaymee p.112 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br>
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br>
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Major sin – Twenty-Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The One Who Commits Suicide which is from the Greatest of Sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves, indeed Allaah is Most Merciful to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah. If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall remit from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden……&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">191 – Narrated by Jundub ibn Abdullaah <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said, “Amongst the nations before you was a man who had a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop until he died. Allaah said, ‘My Slave hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">192 – Narrated Abu Huraira <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever; “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">193 – In an authentic hadeeth: A person was wounded, he hurried death and killed himself with the tip of his sword, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “He is from the people of the fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">194 – It is narrated on the authority of Yahya bin Abee Katheer, on the authority of Abee Qilaaba, on the authority of Thabit bin al-Dahhak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  said : “Cursing a believer is like killing him, and whoever accuses a believer of <em>Kufr</em> then he is like his killer, and he who killed himself with something in this world then Allaah will punish him with that (very thing) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 234<br>
Obligation of Jihad</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And fight against the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious).</b></span><b>&#8221; (9:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Jihad (holy fighting in Allah&#8217;s Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know</b></span><b>.&#8221; (2:216)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allah</b></span><b>&#8221; (9:41)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Jannah. They fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Qur&#8217;an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success</b></span><b>.&#8221; (9:111)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Jannah), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward. Degrees of (higher) grades from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:95, 96)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment? That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives: that will be better for you, if you but know! (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn (Eden) Jannah; that is indeed the great success. And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love: help from Allah (against your enemies) and a near victory. And give glad tidings (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) to the believers</b></span><b>.&#8221; (61:10-13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic Ayat relating to the subject under study are many. The Ahadith are also many; these include the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1285.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked, &#8220;Which deed is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Faith in Allah and His Messenger.</span>&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Jihad (holy fighting) in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221; Then he was asked: &#8220;What is after that (in goodness)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Hajj Mabrur (which is accepted by Allah)</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1286.</b>   Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;Which action is dearest to Allah?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Performing As-Salat (the prayer) at its earliest fixed time</span>.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next (in goodness)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Kindness towards parents</span>.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next (in goodness)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">To participate in Jihad in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1287.</b>  Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;Which deed is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Faith in Allah and Jihad (fighting, struggle) in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1288.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily! Setting out in the early morning or in the evening in order to fight in Allah&#8217;s way is better than the world and what it contains</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1289.</b>   Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Who is the best among men?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A believer who strives in the way of Allah with his wealth and life</span>.&#8221; The man asked again, &#8220;Who is next to him (in excellence)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Next to him is a man who is engaged in worshipping his Rubb in a mountain valley, leaving the people secure from his mischief</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1290.</b>  Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Observing Ribat (e.g., guarding the Islamic frontier for the sake of Allah) for a single day is far better than the world and all that it contains. A place in Jannah as small as the whip of your horse is far better than the world and all that it contains. An endeavour (fighting) in the Cause of Allah in the evening or in the morning is far better than the world and all that it contains.</span>&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1291.</b>   Salman (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Observing Ribat in the way of Allah for a day and a night is far better than observing Saum (fasting) for a whole month and standing in Salat (prayer) in all its nights. If a person dies (while performing this duty), he will go on receiving his reward for his meritorious deeds perpetually, and he will be saved from Al-Fattan</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>1292.</b>  Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The actions of every dead person come to a halt with his death except the one who is on the frontier in Allah&#8217;s way (i.e., observing Ribat). This latter&#8217;s deeds will be made to go on increasing for him till the Day of Resurrection, and he will be secure from the trials in the grave</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1293.</b>  `Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Spending a day on the frontier in Allah&#8217;s way is better than one thousand days in any other place</span>.&#8221;<br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1294.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah guarantees that he who goes out to fight in His way believing in Him and affirming the truth of His Messenger, will either be admitted to Jannah or will be brought back to his home (safely) from where he has set out, with whatever reward or share of booty he may have gained. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if a person is wounded in the way of Allah, he will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wound in the same condition as it was on the day when he received it; its colour will be the colour of blood but its smell will be the smell of musk. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if it were not to be too hard upon the Muslims, I would not lag behind any expedition to fight in the Cause of Allah, but I have neither abundant means to provide them conveyance (horses) nor all other Muslims have it, and it will be hard on them to remain behind when I go forth (for Jihad). By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, I love to fight in the way of Allah and get killed, to fight again and get killed and to fight again and get killed</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1295.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#800000;">Whoever is wounded while fighting in the way of Allah, will come on the Day of Resurrection with blood oozing from his wound having the colour of blood but with the fragrance of musk</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1296.</b>   Muadh (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Jannah becomes incumbent for a Muslim who fights for the Cause of Allah for a period as long as the time between two consecutive turns of milking a she-camel. He who receives a wound or a bruise in the Cause of Allah will appear on the Day of Resurrection as fresh as possible, its colour will be the colour of saffron and its fragrance will be that of musk</span>.&#8221;<br>
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1297.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions came upon a valley containing a rivulet of fresh water and was delighted by it. He reflected: `I wish to withdraw from people and settle in this valley; but I won&#8217;t do so without the permission of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8217; This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he said (to the man), &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not do that, for when any of you remains in Allah&#8217;s way, it is better for him than performing Salat (prayer) in his house for seventy years. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you and admit you to Jannah?

Martyrdom without Fighting</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1353.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The martyrs are of five kinds: One who dies of plague; one who dies of disease of his belly; the drowned; one who dies under the debris (of construction, etc.), and one who dies while fighting in the way of Allah</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1354.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whom do you reckon to be martyr amongst you?</span>&#8221; The Companions replied: &#8220;The one who is killed in Allah&#8217;s way.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In that case, the martyrs among my people would be few</span>.&#8221; The Companions asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Then who are the martyrs?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who is killed in the way of Allah  is a martyr; he who dies naturally in the Cause of Allah is a martyr; he who dies of plague is a martyr; and he who dies of a belly disease is a martyr; and he who is drowned is a martyr.</span>&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith shows the care Allah has for this Ummah, which is the best Ummah of mankind. (<span style="color:#800000;">Editor&#8217;s Note</span>)</p>

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1356.</b>   Sa`id bin Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail (May Allah be pleased with him) reported, one of the ten Companions who were given the glad tidings of entering Jannah reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who dies while defending his property is a martyr; he who dies in defence of his own life is a martyr; and he who dies on defense of his faith is a martyr, he who dies in defence of his family is a martyr</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1357.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What shall I do if someone comes to me with the intention of taking away my property?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not hand over it to him.</span>&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;What shall I do if he fights me?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then fight him</span>.&#8221; &#8220;What will be my position in the Hereafter if he has killed me?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In that case you are a martyr</span>.&#8221; The man asked: &#8220;What if I killed him?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He will be in the Hell-fire</span>.&#8221;<br>

Chapter 11<br>
The Struggle (in the Cause of Allah)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely, guide them to Our paths (i.e., Allah&#8217;s religion &#8211; Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun (gooddoers)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (29:69)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And worship your Rubb until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (15:99)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And remember the Name of your Rubb and devote yourself to Him with a complete devotion.&#8221;</b></span><b> (73:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it&#8221;.</b></span><b> (99:7)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatever good you send before you for yourselves (i.e., Nawafil &#8211; non-obligatory acts of worship: prayers, charity, fasting, Hajj and Umrah, etc.), you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward.&#8221;</b></span><b> (73:20)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatever you spend in good, surely, Allah knows it well.&#8221;</b></span><b> (2:273)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>95.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah the Exalted has said: &#8216;I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>96.</b>   Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Allah says:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216; When a slave of Mine draws near to Me a span, I draw near to him a cubit; and if he draws near to Me a cubit, I draw near to him a fathom. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.&#8221;&#8217;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>97.</b>  Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are two blessings in which many people incur loss. (They are) health and free time (for doing good)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>98.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would stand (in prayer) so long that the skin of his feet would crack. I asked him, &#8220;Why do you do this while your past and future sins have been forgiven?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Should I not be a grateful slave of Allah?&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>99.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> With the start of the last ten days of Ramadan, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would pray all the night, and would keep his family awake for the prayers. He tied his lower garment (i.e., avoided sleeping with his wives) and devoted himself entirely to prayer and supplication.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>100.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A strong believer is better and dearer to Allah than a weak one, and both are good. Adhere to that which is beneficial for you. Keep asking Allah for help and do not refrain from it. If you are afflicted in any way, do not say: `If I had taken this or that step, it would have resulted into such and such,&#8217; but say only: `Allah so determined and did as He willed.&#8217; The word `if&#8217; opens the gates of satanic thoughts&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>101.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The (Hell) Fire is surrounded with all kinds of desires and passions, while Jannah is surrounded with adversities.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>102.</b>  Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I offered Salat (Tahajjud &#8211; optional night prayer) with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) one night, and he started reciting (Surat) Al-Baqarah. I thought that he would bow at the end of one hundred Verses, but he continued reciting; I, then, thought that he would perhaps recite the whole (Surah) in a Rak`ah, but he proceeded on, and I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this Surah); he then started (reciting Surat) An-Nisa&#8217;; he then started (Surat) Al-`Imran and his recitation was unhurried. And when he recited the Verses which referred to the Glory of Allah, he glorified Him (<span style="color:#0000ff;">by saying Subhan Allah &#8211; My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed from every imperfection</span>), the Great, and when he recited the Verses that mention supplication, he supplicated, and when he recited the Verses that mention seeking Refuge of the Rubb, he sought (His) Refuge. Then he bowed and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed from every imperfection (Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim);</span>&#8221; his bowing lasted about the same length of  time as his standing (and then on returning to the standing posture after Ruku<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span>) he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah listened to him who praised Him (Sami` Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal hamd).</span>&#8221; Then he stood about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He then prostrated himself and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed from every imperfection (Subhana Rabbiyal-A`la),&#8221;</span> and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>103.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> One night I joined the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in his (optional) Salat. He prolonged the standing so much that I thought of doing something evil. He was asked: &#8220;What did you intend to do?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;To sit down and leave him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>104.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three follow a dead body: members of his family, his possessions and his deeds. Two of them return and one remains with him. His family and his possessions return; his deeds remain with him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>105.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jannah is nearer to anyone of you than your shoe-lace, and so is the (Hell) Fire&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>106.</b><span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>Rabi`ah bin Ka`b Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span>a servant of the Messenger of Allah and also one of the people of As-Suffah) said: I used to spend my night in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and used to put up water for his ablutions. One day he said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ask something of me.</span>&#8221; I said: &#8220;I request for your companionship in Jannah&#8221;. He inquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is there anything else</span>?&#8221; I said, &#8220;That is all.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then help me in your request by multiplying your prostrations&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>107.</b> Thauban  (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Perform Salah more often. For every prostration that you perform before Allah will raise your position one degree and will remit one of your sins&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>108.</b> `Abdullah bin Busr Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The best of people is one whose life is long and his conduct is good&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>109.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr (May Allah be pleased with him) was absent from the battle of Badr and he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans, and if Allah let me participate in a battle against the pagans, Allah will see what I do.&#8221; So he encountered the day of  Uhud Battle. The Muslims left the positions (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told them to keep) and were defeated, he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah! excuse these people (i.e., the Muslims) for what they have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done</span>&#8220;. Then he went forward with his sword and met Sa`d bin Mu`adh (fleeing) and said to him:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By the Rubb of the Ka`bah! I can smell the fragrance of Jannah from a place closer than Uhud Mount</span>&#8220;. Sa`d said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what he did was beyond my power&#8221;. Anas said: &#8220;We saw over eighty wounds on his body caused by stabbing, striking and shooting of arrows and spears. We found that he was killed, and mutilated by the polytheists. Nobody was able to recognize him except his sister who recognized him by the tips of his fingers.&#8221; Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;We believe that the Ayah<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah [i.e., they have gone out for Jihad (holy fighting), and showed not their backs to the disbelievers]&#8230;&#8217;</span> (33:23), refers to him and his like&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>110.</b> Abu Mas`ud `Uqbah bin `Amr Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Ayah enjoining Sadaqah (charity) was revealed,* we used to carry loads on our backs to earn something that we could give away in charity. One person presented a considerable amount for charity and the hypocrites said: &#8220;He has done it to show off.&#8221; Another one gave away a few Sa` of dates and they said: &#8220;Allah does not stand in need of this person&#8217;s dates&#8221;. Thereupon, it was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Those who defame such of the believers who give charity (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) voluntarily, and such who could not find to give charity (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) except what is available to them&#8230;&#8221;</span> (9:79)<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* This is the A&#8217;yah in which Allah says!<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and suppliate Allah for them.</span>..&#8221; (9:103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>111.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious, said; &#8216;O My slaves, I have prohibited Myself injustice; and have made oppression unlawful for you, so do not oppress one another. O My slaves, all of you are liable to err except the one whom I guide on the Right Path, so seek guidance from Me so that I will guide you to the Right Path. O My slaves, all of you are hungry except the one whom I feed, so ask food from Me, I will feed you. O My slaves, all of you are naked except those whom I clothe, so ask clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My slaves, you commit sins night and day and I forgive all sins, so seek My forgiveness and I shall forgive you. O My slaves, you can neither do Me any harm nor can you do Me any good. O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any man of you, that would not increase My domain a thing. O My slaves, were the first of you, and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any man of you, that would not decrease My domain in a thing. O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to stand in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more than a needle decrease the sea if put into it. O My slaves, it is but your deeds that I reckon for you and then recompense you for, so let him who finds good (i.e., in the Hereafter) praise Allah and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.&#8221;&#8217;.</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 19: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Jihad and Expedition (Kitab Al-Jihad wa&#8217;l-Siyar) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The word Jihad is derived from the verb jahada which means:&#8221; he exerted himself&#8221;. Thus literally, Jihad means exertion, striving; but in juridico-religious sense, it signifies the exertion of one&#8217;s power to the utmost of one&#8217;s capacity in the cause of Allah. This is why the word Jihad has been used as the antonym to the word Qu, ud (sitting) in the Holy Qur&#8217;an (iv. 95). Thus Jihad in Islam is not an act of violence directed indiscriminately against the non-Muslims; it is the name given to an all-round struggle which a Muslim should launch against evil in whatever form or shape it appears. Qital fi sabilillah (fighting in the way of Allah) is only one aspect of Jihad. Even this qital in Islam is not an act of mad brutality. It has its material and moral functions, i. e. self-preservation and the preservation of the moral order in the world. The verdict of all religious and ethical philosophies-ancient and modern-justify war on moral grounds. When one nation is assailted by the ambitions and cupidity of another, the doctrine of non-resistance is anti-social, as it involves non-assertion, not only of one&#8217;s own rights, but of those of others who need protection against the forces of tyranny and oppression. A Muslim is saddled with the responsibilities to protect himself and all those who seek his protection. He cannot afford to abandon the defenceless people, old man, women and children to privation, suffering and moral peril. Fighting in Islam, therefore, represents in Islamic Law what is known among Western jurists as&#8221; just war&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The very first revelation in which the permission to wage war against the forces of evil sums up the aims and objects of qital in Islam: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Permitted&#8217;are those who are fought against, because they have been oppressed. and verily God is more Powerful for their aid. Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: &#8216;Our Lord is Allah, &#8216; for had it not been for &#8216;Allah&#8217;s repelling someone by means of others, cloisters and churches and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft-mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helps one who helps Him. Lo! Allah is Strong. Almighty&#8221; (xxii. 39. 41). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>These verses eloquently speak of &#8216;the fact that it is neither for the acquisition of territory nor for the love of power and distinction that the Muslims have been permitted to raise arms against the enemy. They were allowed to do so because their very existence had been made difficult by the high-handedness of the Meccans. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has elucidated this point in the following verse: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah and for the oppressed among men and women and children who say: Our Lord! take us forth from the town whereof the people are oppressors and grant us from Thee a friend and grant us from Thee a helper&#8221; (iv. 75). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The war in Islam is waged with a view to securing liberty and freedom for those who are groaning under the oppression of heartless tyrants. It is the bounden duty of the Muslims to alleviate their sufferings and create for them an atmosphere of peace and security. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then in the succeeding verse a distinction is also drawn between two types of war: one which is fought for the sake of Allah and the other which is waged for evil ends: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of devil. So fight against the friends of Satan; verily weak indeed is the strategy of the devil&#8221; (iv. 76). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been made clear that those people who fight for self-glorification or for the exploitation of the weak are in fact friends of the devil; wheres those who raise arms to curb tyranny and aggression, to eradicate evil from the human society, fight in the way of Allah. Mere fighting is not, therefore, Jihad in Islam; it is the noble objective alone which makes it a sacred pursuit like devotion and prayer. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari that once a man went to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: One man fights for the sake of spoils of war, the second one fights for fame and glory and the third to display his courage and skill; which among them is the fighter for the cause of Allah? Upon this the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) replied: He who fights with the sole objective that the word of Allah should become supreme is a Mujahid in the cause of the Lord. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A Mujahid is thus a noble person who offers his life for the achievement of lofty ends. He is actuated by human considerations lifts arms not under the impulse of fury and revenge, but with will, fore-thought, tenacity and fellow-feeling, and his conduct bears the imprint of human intellect, human sympathy and sense of justice. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has explained this point in Sura Anfal in these words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; O you who believe, when you meet an enemy, be firm, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful. And obey Allah and His Apostle. And fall with no disputes, lest ye falter and your strength fail; but be steadfast! For Allah is with those who patiently persevere. Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully. And to be seen of men and debar (men) from the way of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do&#8221; (viii. 45-46). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Here the Muslims have been exhorted to observe five principles of war: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be steadfast in the face of the enemy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have full reliance on the help of Allah and remember Him much. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have the unity of purpose and solidarity of corporate life always before your eyes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be fully aware of the lofty purpose before you in fighting. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Don&#8217;t be proud and boastful in your attitude and behaviour. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Islam has purified even war of all its cruelty and horrors and has made it a&#8221; reformative process&#8221; to deal with evil. The Holy Qur&#8217;an bserves: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you and transgress not the limits. Verily Allah loves not the transgressors&#8221; (ii. 190). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has given clear instructions about the behaviour of the Muslim army. He observed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Set out for Jihad in the name of Allah and for the sake of Allah. Do not lay hands on the old verging on death, on women, children and babes. Do not steal anything from the booty and collect together all that falls to your lot in the battlefield and do good, for Allah loves the virtuous and the pious.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So great is the respect for humanly feelings in Islam that even the wanton destruction of enemy&#8217;s crops or property is strictly forbidden. The righteous Caliphs followed closely the teachings of Allah and those of His Apostle in letter and spirit the celebrated address which the first Caliph Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) gave to his army while sending her on the expedition to the Syrian borders is permeated with the noble spirit with which the war in Islam is permitted. He said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman. nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not ary of the enemy&#8217;s flock. save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monast ic services; leave them alone&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is said that once at the time of conquest, a singing girl was brought to al-Muhajir b. Abu Umayya who had been publicly singing satirical poems about Hadrat Abu Bakr. Muhajir got her hand amputated. When the Caliph heard this news, he was shocked and wrote a letter to Muhajir in the following words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; I have learnt that you laid hands on a woman who had hurled abuses on me, and, therefore, got her hand amputated. God has not sought vengeance even in the case of polytheism, which is a great crime. He has not permitted mutilation even with regard to manifest infidelity. Try to be considerate and sympathetic in your attitude towards others in future. Never mutilate, because it is a grave offence. God purified Islam and the Muslims from rashness and excessive wrath. You are well aware of the fact that those enemies fell into the hands of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who had been recklessly abusing him; who had turned him out of his home; and who fought against him, but he never permitted their mutilation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Another letter written by hadrat &#8216;Umar the Second Caliph, which is addressed to sa&#8217;d b. Abu Waqqas, speaks eloquently of the noble spirit with which the Muslims have bear exhorted to take up arms: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Always search your minds and hearts and stress upon your men the need of perfect integrity and sincerity in the cause of Allah. There should be no material end before them in laying down their lives. but they abould deem it a means whereby they can please their Lord and entitle them. selves to His favour: such a spirit of selflessness should be inculcated in the minds of those who unfortunately lack it. Be firm in the thick of the battle as Allah helps man according to the perseverance that he shows in the cause of His faith and he would be rewarded in accordance with the spirit of sacrifice which he displays for the sake of the Lord. Be careful that those who have been entrusted to your care receive no harm at your hands and are never deprived of any of their legitimate rights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Such in fact is the humane and noble attitude which Islam exhorts its followers to adopt on the battlefield where passions are generally let loose. It is an attitude the like of which is not to be found in the history of any other nation. Has the world any code of military ethics more noble and compassionate than this?&#8221; The moral tone adopted by the Caliph Abu Bakr in his instructions to the Syrian army was,&#8221; says a Christian historian,&#8221; so unlike the principles of the Roman government that it must have commanded profound attention from the subject people-such a proclamation announced to Jews and Christians sentiments of justice and principles of toleration which neither Roman emperors nor orthodox bishops had ever adopted as the rule of conduct.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Western scholars have indulged in a good deal of mud-slinging on the question of the use of the sword in Islam. But if one were to reflect calmly on this point one would be convinced that the sword has not been used recklessly by the Muslims; it has been wielded purely with humane feelings in the wider interest of humanity. Utmost regard was always shown to human life, honour and property even on the battlefield. That is why in all the eighty-two encounters between the Muslims and the non-Muslims during the life of the Holy Prophet (may peace he upon him), only 1018 persons lost their lives on both sides. Out of this 259 were Muslims, whereas the remaining 759 belonged to the opposite camp. One wonders at the audacity of these writers only when one compares the religious wars of Charles the Great, in which 4300 pagan Saxons were killed in cold blood, when one recalls the&#8221; famous answer by which the Papal Legate, in the Albigensian war, quieted the scruples of a too conscientious general, &#8216;Kill all, God will know His own&#8217;&#8230;. When we recall the Spanish Inquisition, the conquest of Mexico and Peru, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the sack of Magdeburg by Tilly.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is indeed strange that the criticism on the use of sword by Muslims emanates from those whose hands are soiled in the blood of countless innocent human beings, by those who exult in the techniques of homicide, who have depersonalised warfare to such an extent that millions of innocent men and women are put to death and numberless are thrown into concentration camps and flogged with steel rods and ox-hide whips, and all this is done without any qualm of conscience. As human beings. we hang our heads down in shame when we think of the horrifying atrocities which have been perpetrated by the modern civilised men. It is estimated that. in the First World War, ten million soldiers were killed and an equal number of civilians lost their lives, and twenty million died on account of widespread epidemics and famines throughout the world as an aftermath of this war. Economic costs are estimated at $ 338,000,000,000 of which $ 186,000,000,000 were direct costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The losses in the Second World War were staggeringly greater as compared to those in the first one. Twenty-two million persons were killed and thirty-four million were wounded. The estimated cost of the war was $ 1, 348. 000,000,000 of which $ 1, 167,000,000,000 consisted of direct military costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is significant that in the Korean War, the first instance in which an international organisation for establishing peace utilised military force to suppress aggression, more than one million persons were killed which added to the civilian deaths in Korea and totalled about five millions. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been reported from Sulaiman b. Buraid through his father that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him. He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai&#8217; except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&#8217;s help and fight them. When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah&#8217;s Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah&#8217;s behest with regard to them.</span></p>

When we encountered the enemy, (some of the Muslims turned back (in fear). I saw that a man from the polytheists overpowered one of the Muslims. I turned round and attacked him from behind giving a blow between his neck and shoulder. He turned towards me and grappled with me in such a way that I began to see death staring me in the face. Then death overtook him and left me alone. I joined &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who was saying: What has happened to the people (that they are retreating)? I said: It is the Decree of Allah. Then the people returned. (The battle ended in a victory for the Muslims) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat down (to distribute the spoils of war). He said: One who has killed an enemy and can bring evidence to prove it will get his belongings. So I stood up and said: Who will give evidence for me? Then I sat down. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said like this. I stood up (again) and said: Who will bear witness for me? He (the Holy Prophet) made the same observation the third time, and I stood up (once again). Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you, O Abu Qatada? Then I related the (whole) story, to him. At this, one of the people said: He has told the truth. Messenger of Allah 1 The belongings of the enemy killed by him are with me. Persuade him to forgo his right (in my favour). (Objecting to this proposal) Abu Bakr said: BY Allah, this will not happen. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will not like to deprive one of the lions from among the lions of Allah who fight in the cause of Allah and His Messenger and give thee his share of the booty. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He (Abu Bakr) has told the truth, and so give the belongings to him (Abu Qatada). So he gave them to me. I sold the armour (which was a part of my share of the booty) and bought with the sale proceeds a garden in the street of Banu Salama.

The latter asked Khalid: What prevented you from giving the booty to him? Khalid said: I thought it was too much. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Hand it over to him. Now when Khalid by Auf, the latter pulled him by his cloak and said (by way of chafing him): Hasn&#8217;t the same thing happened what I reported to you from the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him)? When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) heard it. he was angry (and said): Khalid, don&#8217;t give him, Khalid, don&#8217;t give him. Are you going to desert the commanders appointed by roe? Your similitude and theirs is like a person who took camels and sheep for grazing. He grazed them and when it was time for them to have a drink, he brought them to a pool. So they drank from it, drinking away its clear water and leaving the turbid water below So the clear water (i. e. the best reward) is for you and the turbid water (i e. blame) is for them.</span></p>

(One day) when we were having our breakfast with the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), a man came riding a red camel. He made it kneel down, extracted a strip of leather from its girth and tethered the camel with it. Then he began to take food with the people and look (curiously around). We were in a poor condition as some of us were on foot (being without any riding animals). All of a sudden, he left us hurriedy, came to his camel, untethered it, made it kneel down, mounted it and urged the beast which ran off with him. A man on a brown rhe-camel chased him (taking him for a spy). Salama (the narrator) said: I followed on foot. I ran on until I was near the thigh of the she-camel. I advanced further until I was near the haunches of the camel. I advanced still further until I caught hold of the nosestring of the camel. I made it kneel down. As soon as it placed its knee on the ground, I drew my sword and struck at the head, of the rider who fell down. I brought the camel driving it along with the man&#8217;s baggage and weapons. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came forward to meet me and the people were with him. He asked: Who has killed the man? The people said: Ibn Akwa&#8217;. He said: Everything of the man is for him (Ibn Akwa&#8217;).</span></p>

He had been appointed by the Messenger oi Allah (may peace be upon him). When we were onlv at an hour&#8217;s distance from the water of the enemy, Abu Bakr ordered us to attack. We made a halt during the last part of the night tor rest and then we attacked from all sides and reached their watering-place where a battle was fought. Some of the enemies were killed and some were taken prisoners. I saw a group of persons that consisted of women and children. I was afraid lest they should reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow between them and the mountain. When they saw the arrow, they stopped. So I brought them, driving them along. Among them was a woman from Banu Fazara. She was wearing a leather coat. With her was her daughter who was one of the prettiest girls in Arabia. I drove them along until I brought them to Abu Bakr who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize. So we arrived in Medina. I had not yet disrobed her when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) met me in the street and said: Give me that girl, O Salama. I said: Messenger of Allah, she has fascinated me. I had not yet disrobed her. When on the next day. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ag;tin met me in the street, he said: O Salama, give me that girl, may God bless your father.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is reported by Zuhri that this tradition was narrated to him by Malik b. Aus who said: Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sitting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa&#8217; came in and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abd al-Rabman b. &#8216;Auf, Zubair and Sa&#8217;d (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they entered. Then he (Yarfa&#8217;) came again and said: What do you say about &#8216;Ali and Abbas (who are present at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas said: Commander of the Faithful, decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. Malik b. Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by &#8216;Ali and Abbas). &#8216;Umar said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They said: Yes. Then he turned to Abbas and &#8216;Ali and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the heavens and earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They (too) said: Yes. (Then) Umar said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger (may peace be upon him) a special favour that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is for Allah and His Messenger&#8221;. The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous verse or not. Umar continued: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distrbuted among you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and never appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was left over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would meet from its income his annual expenditure, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and &#8216;All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed away, Abu Bakr said:&#8221; I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).&#8221; Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadrat &#8216;Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to &#8216;Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; So both of you thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn&#8217;t it like this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjudge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is narrated on the authority of Urwa b. Zubair who narrated from A&#8217;isha that she informed him that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), sent someone to Abu Bakr to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; The household of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will live on the income from these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upun him) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, &#8216;All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a person to Abu Bakr requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the presence of Umar). &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr said: What will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. &#8216;All recited Tashahhud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognise your moral excellence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favour (i. e. the Catiphate) which Allah nas conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr (in this vein) until the latter&#8217;s eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is dearer to me than the kinship of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. So &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr: This aftetnoon is (fixed) for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of &#8216;Ali, his delay in swearing allegiance and the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God&#8217;s forgiveness. Then &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr and (said that) his action was nott prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr on his part or his refusal to accept the high position which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding: ) But we were of the opinion that we should have a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (explanation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favourably inclined to &#8216;Ali since he adopted the proper course of action.</span></p>

I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, &#8216;Umar handed them over to &#8216;All and Abbas, but &#8216;Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned &#8216;Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who said: When it was the day on which the Battle of Badr was fought, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at the infidels, and they were one thousand while his own Companions were three hundred and nineteen. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) turned (his face) towards the Qibla Then he stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord:&#8221; O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth.&#8221; He continued his supplication to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his shoulders. So Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he embraced him from behind and said:. Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice you, and He will fulfil for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed (the Qur&#8217;anic verse):&#8221; When ye appealed to your Lord for help, He responded to your call (saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession.&#8221; So Allah helped him with angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Zumail said that the badith was narrated to him by Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said: While on that day a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him&#8217; the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizi&#8217;m! He glanced at the polytheist who had (now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related this (event) to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that day (i. e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them): What is your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should release them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infidels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What is your opinion. Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah. I do not hold the same opinion as Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may cut off their heads. Hand over &#8216;Aqil to &#8216;Ali that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such relative to me that I may but off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr and did not approve what I said The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep ate, if not, I will at least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He pointed to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse:&#8221; It is not befitting for a prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed&#8230;&#8221; to the end of the verse:&#8221; so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them.&#8221;</span></p>

He was from the tribe of Banu Hanifa and was called Thumama b. Uthal. He was the chief of the people of Yamama. People bound him with one of the pillars of the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out to (see) him. He said: O Thumama, what do you think? He replied: Muhammad, I have good opinion of you. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be pon him) lefthim (in this condition) for two days, (and came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) left him until the next day when he (came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on the earth more hateful to me than your face, but (now) your face has become to me the dearest of all faces. By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than your religion, but (now) your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on &#8216;Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). By Allah, you will not get a single grain of wheat from Yamama until it is permitted by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated by Anas that (after his migration to Medina) a person placed at the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) disposal some date-palms growing on his land until the lands of Quraiza and Nadir were conquered. Then he began to return to him whatever he had received. (In this connection) my people told me to approach the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and ask from him what his people had given him or a portion thereof, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had bestowed those trees upon Umm Aiman. So I came to the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and he gave hem (back) to me. Umm Aiman (also) came (at this time). She put the cloth round my neck and said: No, by Allah, we will not give to, you what he has granted to me. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Umm Aiman, let him have them and for you are such and such trees instead. But she said: By Allah, there is no god besides Him. No, never! The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) continued saying: (You will get) such and such. until he had granted her ten times or nearly ten times more (than the original gift).</span></p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="019.4380"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan. The latter said: I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi who delivered it to the governor of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated usbefore him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:&#8221; In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects.&#8221; O People of the Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to our being Muslims [iii. 64].&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When he hid finished the reading of the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would triumph until God imbued me with (the spirit of) Islam.</span></p>

I and Abd Sufyan b. Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib stuck to the Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we did not separate from him. And the Messenger of Allah (may place be upon him) was riding on his white mule which had been presented to him by Farwa b. Nufitha al-Judhami. When the Muslims had an encounter with the disbelievers, the Muslims fled, falling back, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to spur his mule towards the disbelievers. I was holding the bridle of the mule of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) checking it from going very fast, and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of the (mule of the) Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who said: Abbas, call out to the people of al-Samura. Abbas (who was a man with a loud voice) called out at the top of the voice: Where are the people of Samura? (Abbas said: ) And by God, when they heard my voice, they came back (to us) as cows come back to their calves, and said: We are present, we are present! &#8216;Abbas said: They began to fight the infidels.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Anas that when (the news of) the advance of Abu Sufyan (at the head of a force) reached him. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) held consultations with his Companions. The narrator said: Abu Bakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke &#8216;Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak). By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so. If you order us to goad our horses to the most distant place like Bark al-Ghimad, we would do so. The narrator said: Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) caught him and interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say&#8217;, I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. &#8216;Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let him go when he tells you a lie. The narrator said: Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: This is the place where so and so would be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here and here; (and) none of them fell away from the place which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had indicated by placing his hand on the earth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated by &#8216;Abdullah b. Rabah from Abu Huraira, who said: Many deputations came to Mu&#8217;awiya. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Huraira was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira said: Should I not tell yon a tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched Abu Ubaida with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: Abu Huraira. I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira continued: Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from this day on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he will be safe. Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. Abu Huraira said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufyan and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba. He reached near an idol by the side of the Ka&#8217;ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa&#8217;, ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka&#8217;ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with the following additions: (i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in your way)&#8230;. (ii) They (the Ansar) replied: We said so, Messenger of Allah! He said: What is my name? I am but Allah&#8217;s bondman and His Messenger.</span></p>

Each of us would prepare food for his companions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira, it is my turn today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira: I wish you could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the food was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid b. Walid as commander of the right flank, Zubair as commander of the left flank, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida as commander of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Huraira, call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left and said: You will meet us at as-Safa&#8217;. (Abu Huraira continued): Whoever was seen by them that day was put to death. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ascended the mount of as-Safa&#8217;. The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspiration descended upon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: You were saying that the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I left my native place for the take of Allah and joined you. So I will live with you and die with you. Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.</span></p>

We said: We do not intend to go to him, but we wish to go (back) to Medina. So they took from us a covenant in the name of God that we would turn back to Medina and would not fight on the side of Muhammad (may peace be upon him).

A man said: If I were in the time of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I would have fought by his side and would have striven hard for his causes. Hudhaifa said: You might have done that, (but you should not make a flourish of your enthusiasm). I was with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the night of the Battle of Abzib and we were gripped by a violent wind and severe cold. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) said: Hark, the man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted).

We kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgtuent by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted) Then he said: Get up Hudhaifa, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by name I had no alternative but to get up. He said: Go and bring me information about the enemy, and do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm as if I were walking in a heated bath untill I reached them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his back against fire I put an arrow in the middle of the bow. intending to shoot at him, when I recalled the words of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)&#8221; Do not provoke them against me.&#8221; Had I shot at him, I would have hit him. But I returned and (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting myself before him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold, so the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrapped me in a blanket that he had in excess to his own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while saying his prayers. So I continued to sleep until it was morning. When it was morning he said: Get up, O heavy sleeper.</span></p>

The one most accursed among the people got up, brought the foetus and, when the Prophet (may peace be upon him) went down in prostration, placed it between his shoulders. Then they laughed at him and some of them leaned upon the others with laughter. And I stood looking. If I had the power, I would have thrown it away from the back of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Prophet (may peace be upon him) had bent down his head in prostration and did not raise it, until a man went (to his house) and informed (his daughter) Fatima, who was a young girl (at that time) (about this ugly incident). She came and removed (the filthy thing) from him. Then she turned towards them rebuking them (the mischief-mongers). When the Prophet (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he invoked God&#8217;s imprecations upon them in a loud voice. When he prayed, he prayed thrice, and when he asked for God&#8217;s blessings, he asked thrice. Then he said thrice: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the Quraish. When they heard his voice, laughter vanished from them and they feared his malediction. Then he said: O God, it is for Thee to deal with Abu Jahl b. Hisham, &#8216;Utba b. Rabi&#8217;a, Shaiba b.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Usama b. Zaid that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) rode a donkey. It had on it a saddle under which was a mattress made at Fadak (a place near Medina). Behind him he seated Usama. He was going to the street of Banu Harith al-Khazraj to inquire after the health of Sa&#8217;d b. Ubada This happened before the Battle of Badr. (He proceeded) until he passed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the Jews and among them were &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and &#8216;Abdullah b. Rawaha. When the dust raised by the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said: Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur&#8217;an. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubida. He said: Sa&#8217;d, haven&#8217;t you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa&#8217;d said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Holy Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.</span></p>

Ubayy (to persuade him to accept Islam). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) (accordingly) went to him, riding a donkey, and (a party of) Muslims also went (with him). On the way they had to walk over a piece of land affected with salinity. When the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approached him, he said: Do not come near me. By Allah, the obnoxious smell of your donkey has offended me. (As a rejoinder to this remark), a man from the Ansar said: By God, the smell of the donkey of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is better than your smell. (At this), a man from the tribe of &#8216;Abdullah got furious. Then people from both sides got furious and exchanged blows with sticks, hands and shoes. (The narrator says) that (after this scuffle) we learnt that (the Qur&#8217;anic verse):&#8221; It two parties of the Believers have a quarrel, make ye peace between them&#8221; (xlix. 9) was revealed about these fighting parties.</span></p>

He said: Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit). He said: Talk (as you like). So, Muhammad b. Maslama came to Ka&#8217;b and talked to him, referred to the old friendship between them and said: This man (i. e. the Holy Prophet) has made up his mind to collect charity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship. When be heard this, Ka&#8217;b said: By God, you will be put to more trouble by him. Muhammad b. Maslama said: No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to forsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give me a loan. He said: What will you mortgage? He said: What do you want? He said: Pledge me your women. He said: You are the most handsome of the Arabs; should we pledge our women to you? He said: Pledge me your children. He said: The son of one of us may abuse us saying that he was pledged for two wasqs of dates, but we can pledge you (cur) weapons. He said: All right. Then Muhammad b. Maslama promised that he would come to him with Harith, Abu &#8216;Abs b. Jabr and Abbad b. Bishr. So they came and called upon him at night. He came down to them. Sufyan says that all the narrators except &#8216;Amr have stated that his wife said: I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder. He said: It is only Muhammad b. Maslama and his foster-brother, Abu Na&#8217;ila. When a gentleman is called at night even it to be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call. Muhammad said to his companions: As he comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: We sense from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So he caught it and smelt. Then he said: Allow me to do so (once again). He then held his head fast and said to his companions: Do your job. And they killed him.</span></p>

We journeyed during the night. One of the people said to (my brother) &#8216;Amir b. al-Akwa&#8217;: Won&#8217;t you recite to us some of your verses? Amir was a poet. So he began to chant his verses to urge the camels, reciting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>O God, if Thou hadst not guided us</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We wish to lay down our lives for Thee; so forgive Thou our lapses,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Bestow upon us peace and tranquillity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this driver (of the camels)? They said: It is &#8216;Amir. He said: God will show mercy to him. A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Behold, God has conquered it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many fires. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What are these fires? And what are they cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic asses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew themselves up in battle array &#8216;Amir caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and &#8216;Amir died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What&#8217;s the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mother be thy ransom, people presume that &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said that? I said: So and so and Usaid b. Hudair al-Ansari. He said: Who has said that has lied. For him (for &#8216;Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.</span></p>

The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) permitted him. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: I know what you will recite. I recited:</span></p>

I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God&#8217;s mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He died as God&#8217;s devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (b.

Abu &#8216;Ubaid who said that he heard Salama b. al-Akwa&#8217; say: I went out before the Adhan for the morning prayer had been delivered. The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) were grazing at Dhu Qarad. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf&#8217;s slave met me and said: The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had been taken away. I said: Who has taken them away? He said: (the people belonging to the tribe of) Ghatafan. I cried thrice: Help! I made the whole city between the two lavas hear my cry. Then I ran straight in their pursuit until I overtook them at Dhu Qarad where they were just going to water their animals. I, being an archer, began to shoot them with my arrows and was saying: I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;. And today is the day when the cowards will meet their doom. I continued to chant until I rescued the milch she-camels from them, and snatched from them thirty mantles. Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and some other people came along. I said: Prophet of Allah, I have prevented them from water while they were thirsty. So you should send a force (to punish them). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ibn al-Akwa&#8217;, you have taken (what, you have taken). Now let them go. Then we returned and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made me mount behind him on his she-camel until we entered Medina.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said: We arrived at Hudaibiya with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats for them which could not be watered (by the small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well The water welled up. We drank and watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the vow. Then other people took the vow. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the vow, Salama. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (You may do) again. Then the Messenger. of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to me): Won&#8217;t you swear allegiance, Salama? I said: Messenger of Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said: (Doesn&#8217;t matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salama, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah, my uncle &#8216;Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O God. I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I was a dependant of Talha b. Ubaidullah. I watered his horse, rubbed its back. I served Talha (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (may peace be uron him). When we and the people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base; (while I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons (to the branches of the tree) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaim has been murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). (At the same time). my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from&#8221; Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forgave them. On this occasion. God revealed the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had granted you a victory over them&#8221; (xlviii. 24). Then we moved returning to Medina, and halted at a place where there was a mountain between us and Banu Lihyan who were polytheists. The Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked God&#8217;s forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Compinions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night. (At last) we reached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent his camels with his slave, Rabah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talha along with the camels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the day dawned, Abd al-Rahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah and Inform the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help I Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogatory) verse in the Iambic metre:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And today is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his shoulder. and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And tody is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances. lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until They came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now) sat down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him (and kill him). (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who are thou? I said: I am Salama, son of al-Akwa&#8217;. By the Being Who has honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) I can kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behind him was Abu Qatada al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad al-Kindi. I caught hold of the rein of Akhram&#8217;s horse (Seeing this). they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his Companions join you. He said: ) Salama, if you believe In Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you kaow that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. so I let him go. Akhram and Abd al-Rahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung Abd al-Rahman&#8217;s horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. Abd al-Rabman turned about riding Akhram&#8217;s horse. Abu Qatada, a horse-man of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), met &#8216;Abd al-Rahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace oe upon him), I followed them running on my feet (so fast) that I couldn&#8217;t see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (may peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;; and today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was wounded) said: May his mother weep over him! Are you the Akwa&#8217; who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa&#8217;. They left two horses dead tired on the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I met &#8216;Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had driven them away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had captured those camels and everything else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists and Bilal had slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and hump for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in the light of the fire, and he said: Salama, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. (At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. When they were exposing its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: They (Akwa&#8217; and his companions) have come. So. they went away fleeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman today is Salama. Then he gave me two shares of the booty-the share meant for the horseman and the share meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-Adba&#8217;. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is there anyone who could compete (with me) in race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He continued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don&#8217;t you show consideration to a dignified person and don&#8217;t you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: It you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I am coming to thee, I then turned my feet. sprang up and tan and gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead of him. By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And descend tranquillity upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this? &#8216;Amir said: it is &#8216;Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed, and well-tried warrior.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar certainly knows that I am &#8216;Amir,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>They exchanged blows. Marbab&#8217;s sword struck the shield of &#8216;Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and beard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for &#8216;Amir there is a double reward. Then he sent me to &#8216;Ali who had tore eyes, and said: I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to &#8216;Ali, brought him beading him along and he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave him the banner (and &#8216;Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). The latter advanced chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows certainly that I am Marhab,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8216;Ali chanted in reply:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the one whose mother named him Haidar, (And am) like a lion of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa&#8217; (i. e. return thir attack with one that is much more fierce).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The narrator said: &#8216;Ali struck at the head of Mirhab and killed him, so the victory (capture of Khaibar) was due to him. This long tradition has also been handed down Through a different chain of transmitters.</span></p>

And the of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not kill the children of the enemy, so thou shouldst not kill the children. Also you have written to me asking me when the orphanhood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a man has become bearded but is still incapable of getting his due from others as well u meeting his obligation towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated you such), but when he can look after his interests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan. And you have written to me inquiring about Khums as to whom it is meant for. (In this connection) we (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah) used to say: It is for us, but those people (i. e. Banu Umayya) have denied it to us.</span></p>

Hurmus) through a different chain of transmitters with the following difference in the elucidation of one of the points raised by Najda in his letter to Ibn Abas: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used not to kill the children, so thou shouldst not kill them unless you could know what Khadir had known about the child he killed, or you could distinguish between a child who would grow up to he a believer (and a child who would grow up to be a non-believer), so that you killed the (prospective) non-believer and left the (prospective) believer aside.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said: Najda b. &#8216;Amir al-Haruri wrote to Ibn Abbas asking him about the slave and the woman as to whether they would get a share from the booty (it they participated in Jihad) ; about the killing of (enemy) children (in war) ; about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end; about kinsmen (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. He said to Yazid: Write to him. (If he were not likely to fall into folly, I would not have written to him.) Write: You have written asking about the woman and the slave whether they would get a share of the booty if they participated in Jihad. (You should know that) there is nothing of the sort for them except that they will be given a prize. And you have written asking me about the killing of the enemy children in war. (You should understand that) the Messenger of Allah (may peare be upon him) did not kill them. and thou shouldst not kill them unless thou knew what the companion of Moses (i. e. Khadir) knew about the boy he had killed. And you have written asking me about the orphan as to when the period of his orphanhood comes to an end, so that the sobriquet of&#8221; orphan&#8221; is dropped from him. (In this regard, you should know that) the sobriquet&#8221; orphan&#8221; will not be dropped from him until he attains maturity of body and mind. And you have written asking me about the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. We think that it is we, but our people have denied us this (position and its concomitant privileges).</span></p>

I was sitting in the company of Ibn &#8216;Abbas when he read his letter and wrote its reply. Ibn Abbas said: Were it not for preventing him from falling into wickedness. I would not have replied to his letter, may he never be joyful. He wrote in reply to him referring to the share of the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) (from the booty) whom God has mentioned. (I have to tell you that) we thought we were the close relatives of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), but our people have refused to recognise us as such. You have asked about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end. (I have to say that) when he reaches the age of marriage, attains maturity of mind, and his property is returned to him, then he is no longer an orphan. You have inquired whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upo him) used to kill anyone from the children of the polytheists in the war. (You should know that) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used not to kill any one of their children, and you (too) should not kill any one of them, except when you knew about them what Khadir had known about the boy whom he killed. And you have inquired whether there is a fixed share of the booty for women and slaves when they participate in a battle. (I have to tell you that) there is no fixed share for them except that they will be given some reward from the spoils of war.</span></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Military Expeditions led by the Prophet(Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) (Al-Maghaazi) </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.059.285">Volume 5, Book 59, Number 285: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Ishaq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was sitting beside Zaid bin Al-Arqam, he was  asked, &#8220;How many Ghazwat did the Prophet undertake?&#8221; Zaid replied,  &#8220;Nineteen.&#8221; They said, &#8220;In how many Ghazwat did you join him?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Seventeen.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Which of these was the first?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Al-&#8216;Ashira or Al-&#8216;Ashiru.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.059.286"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 286: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>From Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh: Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh was an intimate friend  of Umaiya bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay with Sad,  and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived  at Medina, Sa&#8217;d went to perform &#8216;Umra and stayed at Umaiya&#8217;s home in Mecca. He said to  Umaiya, &#8220;Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to  perform Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met  them and said, &#8220;O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;He is Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, &#8220;I see you wandering about  safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter to the people who have  changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and  support them. By Allah, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be  able to go your family safely.&#8221; Sad, raising his voice, said to him, &#8220;By Allah,  if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent  you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through  Medina.&#8221; On this, Umaiya said to him, &#8220;O Sad do not raise your voice before  Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;O  Umaiya, stop that! By Allah, I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle predicting that the Muslim will  kill you.&#8221; Umaiya asked, &#8220;In Mecca?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;  Umaiya was greatly scared by that news. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife,  &#8220;O Um Safwan! Don&#8217;t you know what Sad told me? &#8220;She said, &#8220;What has he told  you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He claims that Muhammad has informed them (i.e. companions  that they will kill me. I asked him, &#8216;In Mecca?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I do not know.&#8221; Then  Umaiya added, &#8220;By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca.&#8221; But when the day of (the  Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, &#8220;Go and protect your  caravan.&#8221; But Umaiya disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said,  &#8220;O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief of the  people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.&#8221; Abu Jahl kept on urging  him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, &#8220;As you have forced me to change my mind, by  Allah, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). &#8220;O Um  Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey).&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;O Abu Safwan!  Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I do  not want to go with them but for a short distance.&#8221; So when Umaiya went out, he used  to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on doing that till Allah caused him to be  killed at Badr. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I never failed to join Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any of his  Ghazawat except in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. However, I did not take part in the Ghazwa of  Badr, but none who failed to take part in it, was blamed, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out  to meet the caravans of (Quraish, but Allah caused them (i.e. Muslims) to meet their enemy  unexpectedly (with no previous intention) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad in a scene which would  have been dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene. He (i.e.  Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the Muslims to fight with the  pagans. Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;We will not say as the People of Moses said: Go you and your  Lord and fight you two. (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in  front of you and behind you.&#8221; I saw the face of the Prophet getting bright with  happiness, for that saying delighted him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the battle of Badr, the Prophet said, &#8220;O  Allah! I appeal to You (to fulfill) Your Covenant and Promise. O Allah! If Your Will is  that none should worship You (then give victory to the pagans).&#8221; Then Abu Bakr took  hold of him by the hand and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for you.&#8221; The Prophet came  out saying, &#8220;Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their  backs.&#8221; (54.45) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;I had an agreement with Umaiya bin Khalaf (that he  would look after my relatives and property in Mecca, and I would look after his relatives  and property in Medina).&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then mentioned the killing of Umaiya and his  son on the day of Badr, and Bilal said, &#8220;Woe to me if Umaiya remains safe (i.e.  alive) . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet recited Surat-an-Najm and then prostrated  himself, and all who were with him prostrated too. But an old man took a handful of dust  and touched his forehead with it saying, &#8220;This is sufficient for me.&#8221; Later on I  saw him killed as an infidel. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa (the son of Az- Zubair): Az-Zubair had three  scars caused by the sword, one of which was over his shoulder and I used to insert my  fingers in it. He received two of those wounds on the day of Badr and one on the day of  Al-Yarmuk. When &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair was killed, &#8216;Abdul-Malik bin Marwan said to me,  &#8220;O &#8216;Urwa, do you recognize the sword of Az-Zubair?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;What marks does it have?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;It has a dent in its sharp  edge which was caused in it on the day of Badr.&#8221; &#8216;Abdul- Malik said, &#8220;You are  right! (i.e. their swords) have dents because of clashing with the regiments of the  enemies Then &#8216;Abdul-Malik returned that sword to me (i.e. Urwa). (Hisham, &#8216;Urwa&#8217;s son  said, &#8220;We estimated the price of the sword as three-thousand (Dinars) and after that  it was taken by one of us (i.e. the inheritors) and I wish I could have had it.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of (the battle) of Al-Yarmuk, the companions of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;Will you attack the enemy so that we shall attack  them with you?&#8221; Az-Zubair replied, &#8220;If I attack them, you people would not  support me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, we will support you.&#8221; So Az-Zubair attacked  them (i.e. Byzantine) and pierced through their lines, and went beyond them and none of  his companions was with him. Then he returned and the enemy got hold of the bridle of his  (horse) and struck him two blows (with the sword) on his shoulder. Between these two  wounds there was a scar caused by a blow, he had received on the day of Badr (battle).  When I was a child I used to play with those scars by putting my fingers in them. On that  day (my brother) &#8220;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was also with him and he was ten years old.  Az-Zubair had carried him on a horse and let him to the care of some men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Badr, the Prophet ordered that the corpses of  twenty four leaders of Quraish should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr.  (It was a habit of the Prophet that whenever he conquered some people, he used to stay at  the battle-field for three nights. So, on the third day of the battle of Badr, he ordered  that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his companions followed him saying  among themselves.&#8221; &#8220;Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet) is proceeding for some  great purpose.&#8221; When he halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of  the Quraish infidels by their names and their fathers&#8217; names, &#8220;O so-and-so, son of  so-and-so and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so! Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed  Allah and His Apostle? We have found true what our Lord promised us. Have you too found  true what your Lord promised you? &#8220;&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You are  speaking to bodies that have no souls!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, you do not hear, what I say better than they do.&#8221; (Qatada  said, &#8220;Allah brought them to life (again) to let them hear him, to reprimand them and  slight them and take revenge over them and caused them to feel remorseful and  regretful.&#8221;) </font></p>

If he is in Paradise, I shall remain patient,  and hope for reward from Allah, but if it is not so, then you shall see what I do?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Abu Marthad and Az-Zubair, and all  of us were riding horses, and said, &#8220;Go till you reach Raudat-Khakh where there is a  pagan woman carrying a letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta&#8217; a to the pagans of Mecca.&#8221; So  we found her riding her camel at the place which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned. We said  (to her),&#8221;(Give us) the letter.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter.&#8221; Then we  made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we  will strip you naked.&#8221; When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below  her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter,  and we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This  Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!&#8221;  The Prophet asked Hatib, &#8220;What made you do this?&#8221; Hatib said, &#8220;By Allah, I  did not intend to give up my belief in Allah and His Apostle but I wanted to have some  influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Allah might protect my family and  property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through  whom Allah protects his family and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has spoken  the truth; do no say to him but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He as betrayed Allah, His  Apostle and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and  said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, &#8216;I have forgiven  you.&#8221;&#8216; On this, tears came out of Umar&#8217;s eyes, and he said, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know better.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was fighting in the front file on the day (of the  battle) of Badr, suddenly I looked behind and saw on my right and left two young boys and  did not feel safe by standing between them. Then one of them asked me secretly so that his  companion may not hear, &#8220;O Uncle! Show me Abu Jahl.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O nephew!  What will you do to him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have promised Allah that if I see him  (i.e. Abu Jahl), I will either kill him or be killed before I kill him.&#8221; Then the  other said the same to me secretly so that his companion should not hear. I would not have  been pleased to be in between two other men instead of them. Then I pointed him (i.e. Abu  Jahl) out to them. Both of them attacked him like two hawks till they knocked him down.  Those two boys were the sons of &#8216;Afra&#8217; (i.e. an Ansari woman). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 325: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent out ten spies under the command of  &#8216;Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari, the grand-father of &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Umar Al-Khattab. When they  reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, their presence was made known  to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent about one hundred archers after  them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of  dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, &#8220;These  dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),&#8221; and went on tracing the Muslims&#8217; footsteps. When  &#8216;Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the  enemy encircled them and said, &#8220;Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise  and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit said, &#8220;O  people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O  Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.&#8221; So the archers threw their arrows at them and  martyred &#8216;Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise  and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers  got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with  them. The third man said, &#8220;This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not  go with you for I follow the example of these.&#8221; He meant the martyred companions. The  archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid  bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca  after the event of the Badr battle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sons of Al-Harit bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for  he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin &#8216;Amr on the day (of the battle)  of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him.  One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his public  hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers  went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the  razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said,  &#8220;Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.&#8221; Later on  (while narrating the story) she said, &#8220;By Allah, I had never seen a better captive  than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while  he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca.&#8221; She  used to say,&#8221; It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to  martyr him, Khubaib requested them. &#8220;Allow me to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221;  They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, &#8220;By Allah! Had I not been  afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.&#8221; Then he  (invoked evil upon them) saying, &#8220;O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and  do not leave anyone of them&#8221;&#8216; Then he recited: &#8220;As I am martyred as a Muslim, I  do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake, for this is for the Cause of  Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body.&#8221; Then Abu Sarva, &#8216;Ubqa  bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of  praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet  told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were  martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit&#8217;s death, sent some  messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for  he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a  swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of &#8216;Asim, and they shielded him from the  messengers who could not cut anything from his body. </font></p>

He died while she wa pregnant during Hajjat-ul-Wada.&#8217; Soon after his  death, she gave birth to a child. When she completed the term of deliver (i.e. became  clean), she prepared herself for suitors. Abu As-Sanabil bin Bu&#8217;kak, a man from the tribe  of Bani Abd-ud-Dal called on her and said to her, &#8220;What! I see you dressed up for the  people to ask you in marriage. Do you want to marry By Allah, you are not allowed to marry  unless four months and ten days have elapsed (after your husband&#8217;s death).&#8221; Subai&#8217;a  in her narration said, &#8220;When he (i.e. Abu As-Sanabil) said this to me. I put on my  dress in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him about this problem. He gave  the verdict that I was free to marry as I had already given birth to my child and ordered  me to marry if I wished.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Said bin Malik Al-Khudri returned from a journey and  his family offered him some meat of sacrifices offered at &#8216;Id ul Adha. On that he said,  &#8220;I will not eat it before asking (whether it is allowed).&#8221; He went to his  maternal brother, Qatada bin N i &#8216;man, who was one of the Badr warriors, and asked him  about it. Qatada said, &#8220;After your departure, an order was issued by the Prophet  cancelling the prohibition of eating sacrifices after three days.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I met Ubaida bin Said bin Al-As on  the day (of the battle) of Badr and he was covered with armor; so much that only his eyes  were visible. He was surnamed Abu Dhat-al-Karish. He said (proudly), &#8216;I am Abu-al-Karish.&#8217;  I attacked him with the spear and pierced his eye and he died. I put my foot over his body  to pull (that spear) out, but even then I had to use a great force to take it out as its  both ends were bent.&#8221; &#8216;Urwa said, &#8220;Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Az-Zubair for  the spear and he gave it to him. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, Az-Zubair took it back. After  that Abu Bakr demanded it and he gave it to him, and when Abu Bakr died, Az-Zubair took it  back. &#8216;Umar then demanded it from him and he gave it to him. When &#8216;Umar died, Az-Zubair  took it back, and then &#8216;Uthman demanded it from him and he gave it to him. When &#8216;Uthman  was martyred, the spear remained with Ali&#8217;s offspring. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair  demanded it back, and it remained with him till he was martyred. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had a she-camel which I got in my share from the booty of  the battle of Badr, and the Prophet had given me another she camel from the Khumus which  Allah had bestowed on him that day. And when I intended to celebrate my marriage to  Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani  Qainuqa &#8216;that he should go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by  gold-smiths) which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on the  marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack saddles for my two  she-camels which were kneeling down beside an Ansari&#8217;s dwelling and after collecting what  I needed, I suddenly found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their  flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken out. On seeing that,  I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done that?&#8221; They (i.e. the people)  said, &#8220;Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib has done it. He is present in this house with some  Ansari drinkers, a girl singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, &#8220;O  Hamza, get at the fat she-camels!&#8221; On hearing this, Hamza rushed to his sword and cut  of the camels&#8217; humps and cut their flanks open and took out portions from their  livers.&#8221; Then I came to the Prophet, with whom Zaid bin Haritha was present. The  Prophet noticed my state and asked, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I have never experienced such a day as today! Hamza attacked my two  she-camels, cut off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in a  house along some drinkers.&#8221; The Prophet asked for his cloak, put it on, and  proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he reached the house where Hamza  was. He asked the permission to enter, and he was permitted. The Prophet started blaming  Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the  Prophet then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves more to look at his  face and then said, &#8220;You are not but my father&#8217;s slaves.&#8221; When the Prophet  understood that Hamza was drunk, he retreated, walking backwards went out and we left with  him. </font></p>

Some days later, Allah&#8217;s Apostle demanded her hand in marriage and I married  her to him. Later on Abu Bakr met me and said, &#8220;Perhaps you were angry with me when  you offered me Hafsa for marriage and I gave no reply to you?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr  said, &#8216;Nothing prevented me from accepting your offer except that I learnt that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle had referred to the issue of Hafsa and I did not want to disclose the secret of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle , but had he (i.e. the Prophet) given her up I would surely have accepted  her.&#8221; </font></p>

You are addressing dead people.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied,  &#8216;You do not hear what I am saying, better than they.&#8217; The total number of Muslim fighters  from Quraish who fought in the battle of Badr and were given their share of the booty,  were 81 men.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;When their shares were distributed, their number  was 101 men. But Allah knows it better.&#8221; </font></p>

He exiled all the Jews from Medina. They  were the Jews of Bani Qainuqa&#8217;, the tribe of &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam and the Jews of Bani  Haritha and all the other Jews of Medina. </font></p>

You will  see who is far from it (i.e. Al-Buwaira) And which of our lands will be Harmed by it (i.e.  the burning of Al-Buwaira).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus Al-Hadathan An-Nasri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That once &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab called him and while he was  sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Uthman,  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, AzZubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) who are waiting for your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes, let them come in.&#8221; After a while, Yarfa-  came again and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas who are asking your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So, when the two entered, &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali). &#8220;Both of them  had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle  as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas started reproaching each  other. The (present) people (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the  believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;Wait I beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the  earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets) our properties are  not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,&#8217; and he said it  about himself?&#8221; They (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his company) said, &#8220;He did say it.  &#8220;&#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both, by  Allah! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said this?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative.  He said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His  Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give  to anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And what Allah gave to His Apostle  (&#8220;Fai&#8221;&#8221; Booty) from them&#8211;For which you made no expedition With either  Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And  Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; (59.6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  . But by Allah, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it,  but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of  it. And from this Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and  whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&#8217;s Property is spent (i.e. in  charity), Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and  Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge  of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and  all of you (at that time) knew all about it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and  &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of it in the way you have  described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and  the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for  the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere,  pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you  (i.e. &#8216;Ali and Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O  &#8216;Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our  property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; Then when I  thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you  will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or  else you should not speak to me (about it).&#8217; So, both of you said to me, &#8216;Hand it over to  us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now  to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, with Whose Permission both the  sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision)  till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that  property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf.&#8221; The sub-narrator  said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, &#8216;Malik bin Aus has told  the truth&#8221; I heard &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet saying, &#8216;The wives of the Prophet  sent &#8216;Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted  to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don&#8217;t  you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we  leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added:  &#8216;The family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the  Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of that.&#8217; So, this property (of Sadaqa) was  in the hands of Ali who withheld it from &#8216;Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the  hands of Hasan bin &#8216;Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin &#8216;Ali, and then in the hands of  Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn,  then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is willing to kill Ka&#8217;b bin  Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah and His Apostle?&#8221; Thereupon Muhammad bin Maslama got up  saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would you like that I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;Then allow me to say a (false) thing  (i.e. to deceive Kab). &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;You may say it.&#8221; Then Muhammad  bin Maslama went to Kab and said, &#8220;That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e.  Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from  you.&#8221; On that, Kab said, &#8220;By Allah, you will get tired of him!&#8221; Muhammad  bin Maslama said, &#8220;Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless  and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or  two of food.&#8221; (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab  said, &#8220;Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied,  &#8220;Mortgage your women to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women to  you and you are the most handsome of the &#8216;Arabs?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Then mortgage your  sons to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would  be abused by the people&#8217;s saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of  food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He  came to Kab at night along with Kab&#8217;s foster brother, Abu Na&#8217;ila. Kab invited them to come  into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, &#8220;Where are you  going at this time?&#8221; Kab replied, &#8220;None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster)  brother Abu Na&#8217;ila have come.&#8221; His wife said, &#8220;I hear a voice as if dropping  blood is from him, Ka&#8217;b said. &#8220;They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and  my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if  invited to be killed.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators  mention the men as &#8216;Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin  Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, &#8220;When Ka&#8217;b comes, I will  touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him.  I will let you smell his head.&#8221; Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his  clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama said. &#8221; have never smelt a  better scent than this. Ka&#8217;b replied. &#8220;I have got the best &#8216;Arab women who know how  to use the high class of perfume.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka&#8217;b &#8220;Will you  allow me to smell your head?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Muhammad smelt it and made  his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka&#8217;b again, &#8220;Will you let me  (smell your head)?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; When Muhammad got a strong hold of  him, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Get at him!&#8221; So they killed him and went to  the Prophet and informed him. (Abu Rafi) was killed after Ka&#8217;b bin Al-Ashraf.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 371: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent some men from the Ansar to ((kill) Abu  Rafi, the Jew, and appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin Atik as their leader. Abu Rafi used to hurt  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and help his enemies against him. He lived in his castle in the land of  Hijaz. When those men approached (the castle) after the sun had set and the people had  brought back their livestock to their homes. Abdullah (bin Atik) said to his companions,  &#8220;Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the  gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdullah proceeded towards the  castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending  to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered  &#8216;Abdullah as one of the castle&#8217;s servants) addressing him saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Servant!  Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added in his story,  &#8220;So I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the  gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the  keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu Rafi for a  pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly entertainment went  away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to  myself, &#8216;Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till  I have killed him.&#8217; So I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his  family, I could not recognize his location in the house. So I shouted, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; Abu  Rafi said, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the  sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, and I came out  of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, &#8216;What is this  voice, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a  sword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the  sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized  that I have killed him. I then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase,  and thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg  broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till I sat at the  gate, and said, &#8216;I will not go out tonight till I know that I have killed him.&#8217; So, when  (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall  saying, &#8216;I announce the death of Abu Rafi, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my  companions and said, &#8216;Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi,&#8217; So I (along  with my companions proceeded and) went to the Prophet and described the whole story to  him. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it  and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment whatsoever.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Atik and &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Utba with a group of men to Abu Rafi (to kill him). They proceeded till they approached  his castle, whereupon &#8216;Abdullah bin Atik said to them, &#8220;Wait (here), and in the  meantime I will go and see.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said later on, &#8220;I played a trick in order  to enter the castle. By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a  flaming light to search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my  head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, &#8216;Whoever  wants to come in, should come in before I close the gate.&#8217; So I went in and hid myself in  a stall of a donkey near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi and  had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. When the voices  vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the  gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked  the gate of the castle, saying to myself, &#8216;If these people should notice me, I will run  away easily.&#8217; Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside while they were  inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi by a staircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with  its light off, and I could not know where the man was. So I called, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; He  replied, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my  blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a different tone  of my voice, &#8216; What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you not surprised? Woe  on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!&#8217; So again I aimed at him and  hit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi cried loudly and his wife  got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi lying  straight on his back, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the  sound of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase  to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to  my companions limping. I said (to them), &#8216;Go and tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle of this good news,  but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi&#8217;s) death.&#8217;  When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, &#8216;I convey to you  the news of Abu Rafi&#8217;s death.&#8217; I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I  caught up with my companions before they reached the Prophet to whom I conveyed the good  news.&#8221; </font></p>

The Muslims started saying, &#8220;The booty, the  booty!&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;The Prophet had taken a firm promise from me  not to leave this place.&#8221; But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused  (to stay there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they  suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, &#8220;Is Muhammad  present amongst the people?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abd Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab  amongst the people?&#8221; He then added, &#8220;All these people have been killed, for,  were they alive, they would have replied.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar could not help saying,  &#8220;You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy.&#8221;  Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Superior may be Hubal!&#8221; On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have  (the idol) Al-&#8216;Uzza, whereas you have no &#8216;Uzza!&#8221; The Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is  always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead  men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.&#8221; Narrated  Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as  martyrs. </font></p>

Then worldly wealth was bestowed upon  us and we were given thereof too much. We are afraid that the reward of our deeds have  been given to us in this life.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then started weeping so much that he  left the food. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We migrated in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, seeking  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. So our reward became due and sure with Allah. Some of us have been dead  without enjoying anything of their rewards (here), and one of them was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar  who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, and did not leave anything except a  Namira (i.e. a sheet in which he was shrouded). If we covered his head with it, his feet  became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet  said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over  his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet.&#8221; But some amongst us have got the fruits of  their labor ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: His uncle (Anas bin An-Nadr) was absent from  the battle of Badr and he said, &#8220;I was absent from the first battle of the Prophet  (i.e. Badr battle), and if Allah should let me participate in (a battle) with the Prophet,  Allah will see how strongly I will fight.&#8221; So he encountered the day of Uhud battle.  The Muslims fled and he said, &#8220;O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these  people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done.&#8221;  Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh (fleeing), and asked him,  &#8220;Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud.&#8221; Then he  proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister  recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds  caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their  Covenant with Allah, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Allah (i.e. they  have been Killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting&#8221; (33.23) So  we wrote this in its place in the Quran. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet set out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of  those who had gone out with him, returned. The companions of the Prophet were divided into  two groups. One group said, &#8220;We will fight them (i.e. the enemy),&#8221; and the other  group said, &#8220;We will not fight them.&#8221; So there came the Divine Revelation:&#8211; &#8216;(O  Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about  the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.&#8217;  (4.88) On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;That is Taiba (i.e. the city of Medina) which  clears one from one&#8217;s sins as the fire expels the impurities of silver.&#8221; </font></p>

My father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left nine (orphan) daughters who  are my nine sisters; so I disliked to have another young girl of their age, but (I sought)  an (elderly) woman who could comb their hair and look after them.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;You have done the right thing.&#8221; </font></p>

Jabir, added, &#8220;When the season  of plucking the dates came, I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;You know that my  father was martyred on the day of Uhud, and he was heavily in debt, and I would like that  the creditors should see you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and pile every kind of  dates apart.&#8221; I did so and called him (i.e. the Prophet ). When the creditors saw  him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had  never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates  thrice, and then sat over it and said, &#8216;O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the  creditors).&#8217; Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till  Allah paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of  those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts of my father. But Allah saved  all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet had been  sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof.&#8221; </font></p>

If a man carrying a quiver full of arrows passed by, the Prophet would say  (to him), put (scatter) its contents for Abu Talha.&#8221; The Prophet would raise his head  to look at the enemy, whereupon Abu Talha would say, &#8220;Let my father and mother be  sacrificed for you ! Do not raise your head, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you.  (Let) my neck (be struck) rather than your neck.&#8221; I saw &#8216;Aisha, the daughter of Abu  Bakr, and Um Sulaim rolling up their dresses so that I saw their leg-bangles while they  were carrying water skins on their backs and emptying them in the mouths of the (wounded)  people. They would return to refill them and again empty them in the mouths of the  (wounded) people. The sword fell from Abu Talha&#8217;s hand twice or thrice (on that day). </font></p>

Hudhaifa looked, and on seeing his father  Al-Yaman, he shouted, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Worshippers, my father, my father!&#8221; But by  Allah, they did not stop till they killed him.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to perform the Hajj to (Allah&#8217;s) House. Seeing  some people sitting, he said, &#8220;Who are these sitting people?&#8221; Somebody said,  &#8220;They are the people of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man?&#8221; They  said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He went to him and said, &#8220;I want to ask you about  something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of  this (Sacred) House, do you know that &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan fled on the day of Uhud?&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you know that he (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) was  absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance  (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Come along;  I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked. As for the flight (of &#8216;Uthman)  on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr  (battle), he was married to the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was ill, so the  Prophet said to him, &#8216;You will have such reward as a man who has fought the Badr battle  will get, and will also have the same share of the booty.&#8217; As for his absence from the  Ridwan Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than  &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan, the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of &#8216;Uthman. So the  Prophet sent him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman to Mecca) and the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance took place  after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. &#8216;This is the  hand of &#8216;Uthman,&#8217; and clapped it over his other hand and said, &#8220;This is for  &#8216;Uthman.'&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then said (to the man), &#8220;Go now, after taking this  information.&#8221; </font></p>

We enquired about him and somebody said to  us, &#8220;He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin.&#8221; So  we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he  greeted us in return. &#8216;Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except  his eyes and feet. &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;O Wahshi! Do you know me?&#8221; Wahshi looked  at him and then said, &#8220;No, by Allah! But I know that &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a  woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at  Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with  his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child&#8217;s  feet.&#8221; Then &#8216;Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), &#8220;Will you tell  us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?&#8221; Wahshi replied &#8220;Yes, Hamza killed  Tuaima bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said to  me, &#8216;If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free.&#8221; When the  people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of &#8216;Ainain ..&#8217;Ainain is a mountain  near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the  people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba&#8217; came out and said, &#8216;Is  there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?&#8217; Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib came out  and said, &#8216;O Siba&#8217;. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge  Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant  like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near  me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his  buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with  them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and  when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I was told that the  Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. When he saw me, he said, &#8216;Are you Wahshi?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was it you  who killed Hamza?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;What happened is what you have been told of.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Can  you hide your face from me?&#8217; So I went out when Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, and Musailamah  Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, &#8216;I will go out to Musailamah so  that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza. So I went out with the people (to  fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that  battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked  like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him,  driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders,  and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers  (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave.&#8221; </font></p>

When Fatima saw that the water aggravated the  bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burnt it, and inserted its ashes into the wound so  that the blood was congealed (and bleeding stopped). His canine tooth got broken on that  day, and face was wounded, and his helmet was broken on his head.&#8221; </font></p>

Then he said, &#8220;I will be a witness  for them on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; He ordered them to be buried with their blood  (on their bodies). Neither was the funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed.  Jabir added, &#8220;When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his face.  The companions of the Prophet stopped me from doing so but the Prophet did not stop me.

He did not leave behind except a sheet of striped woolen cloth. If we  covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his  head became naked. The Prophet said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir  (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet,&#8221; or said, &#8220;Put some Idhkhir over his  feet.&#8221; But some of us have got their fruits ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent a Sariya of spies and appointed &#8216;Asim bin  Thabit, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set  out, and when they reached (a place) between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one  of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed  their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. &#8216;Asim  and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey  food from Medina. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The archers said, &#8220;These are the dates of  Medina,&#8221; and followed their traces till they took them over. When &#8216;Asim and his  companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers  encircled them and said, &#8220;You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to  us, we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim said, &#8220;As for me, I will never come  down on the security of an infidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us.&#8221; So they  fought with them till they killed &#8216;Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows,  and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a  covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When  they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The  third man who was with them said, &#8220;This is the first breach in the covenant,&#8221;  and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but  he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they  sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was  Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for  a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib  borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave  it to him. She said later on, &#8220;I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved  towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my  distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said &#8216;Are you afraid that I will  kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,&#8217; &#8221; Later on she used to say, &#8220;I  have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes  although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron  chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.&#8221; So they  took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, &#8220;Allow me to offer a  two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221; Then he went to them and said, &#8220;Had I not been afraid that  you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time.&#8221; So it  was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He  then said, &#8220;O Allah! Count them one by one,&#8221; and added, &#8216;When I am being  martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake,  because this death is in Allah&#8217;s Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.&#8221;  Then &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish  (infidels) sent some people to &#8216;Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his  death might be known for certain, for &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day of  Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who  could not harm his body consequently. </font></p>

The people (i.e. Al-Qurra) said, &#8216;By  Allah, we have not come to harm you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something  for the Prophet.&#8217; But (the infidels) killed them. The Prophet therefore invoked evil upon  them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the beginning of Al Qunut and we used  not to say Qunut before that.&#8221; A man asked Anas about Al-Qunut, &#8220;Is it to be  said after the Bowing (in the prayer) or after finishing the Recitation (i.e. before  Bowing)?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;No, but (it is to be said) after finishing the  Recitation.&#8221; </font></p>

When they were at  the well of Ma&#8217;una, the infidels killed them by betraying them. When this news reached the  Prophet , he said Al-Qunut for one month In the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of  the &#8216;Arab tribes, upon Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Libyan. We used to read a verse of  the Qur&#8217;an revealed in their connection, but later the verse was cancelled.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet sent his uncle, the brother of Um Sulaim  at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail proposed three  suggestions (to the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the  bedouins will be under your command and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or  that I will be your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand from  Bani Ghatafan.&#8221; But &#8216;Amir was infected with plague in the House of Um so-and-so. He  said, &#8220;Shall I stay in the house of a lady from the family of so-and-so after having  a (swelled) gland like that she-camel? Get me my horse.&#8221; So he died on the back of  his horse. Then Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man from  so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of &#8216;Amir). Haram said (to his  companions), &#8220;Stay near to me, for I will go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should  give me protection, you will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go  back to your companions. Then Haram went to them and said, &#8220;Will you give me  protection so as to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So, he started talking  to them&#8217; but they signalled to a man (to kill him) and he went behind him and stabbed him  (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded, by the Lord of  the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; The companion of Haram was pursued by the infidels, and then they (i.e.  Haram&#8217;s companions) were all killed except the lame man who was at the top of a mountain.  Then Allah revealed to us a verse that was among the cancelled ones later on. It was: &#8216;We  have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased.&#8217; (After this event)  the Prophet invoked evil on the infidels every morning for 30 days. He invoked evil upon  the (tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle </font></p>

I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our)  going out.&#8221; So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet and it was Al-Jad&#8217;a  . They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where  they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of &#8216;Abdullah bin Al-Tufail bin  Sakhbara &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s brother from her mother&#8217;s side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir  used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them  before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and  then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his  job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. &#8216;Amir) too went  along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns  till they reached Medina. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma&#8217;una. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma&#8217;una were  martyred and &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya Ad-Damri was taken prisoner, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail, pointing at  a killed person, asked Amr, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya said to him, &#8220;He  is &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira.&#8221; &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail said, &#8220;I saw him lifted to the sky  after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought  down upon the earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet and he  announced the news of their death saying, &#8220;Your companions (of Bir Ma&#8217;una) have been  killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us  as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us.&#8221; So Allah informed them (i.e.  the Prophet and his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that day, &#8216;Urwa bin Asma bin As-Salt who was one of  them, was killed, and Urwa (bin Az-Zubair) was named after &#8216;Urwa bin Asma and Mundhir (bin  AzZubair) was named after Mundhir bin &#8216;Amr (who had also been martyred on that day). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet invoked evil upon those (people) who killed his  companions at Bir Mauna for 30 days (in the morning prayer). He invoked evil upon (tribes  of) Ril, Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle. Allah revealed a Quranic  Verse to His Prophet regarding those who had been killed, i.e. the Muslims killed at Bir  Ma&#8217;una, and we recited the Verse till later it was cancelled. (The Verse was:) &#8216;Inform our  people that we have met our Lord, and He is pleased with us, and we are pleased with  Him.&#8221; </font></p>

Anas replied, &#8220;Yes (Al-Qunut was said by the Prophet in the prayer).&#8221; I  said, &#8220;Is it before Bowing or after Bowing?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;(It was said)  before (Bowing).&#8221; I said, &#8220;So-and-so informed me that you told him that it was  said after Bowing.&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He was mistaken, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  Al-Qunut after Bowing for one month. The Prophet had sent some people called Al-Qurra who  were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . But those who had concluded the treaty with Allah&#8217;s Apostle violated the treaty  (and martyred all the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the  prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq (  i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;Here is a rock appearing across the trench.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am coming  down.&#8221; Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten  anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade and struck the big solid rock and  it became like sand. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to go home.&#8221; (When the  Prophet allowed me) I said to my wife, &#8220;I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot  treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have  barley and a she goat.&#8221; So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then  we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet when the dough  had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly  been well-cooked, and said, &#8220;I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, you and one or two men along with you (for the food).&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;How much is that food?&#8221; I told him about it. He said, &#8220;It is abundant and  good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out  any bread from the oven till I reach there.&#8221; Then he said (to all his companions),  &#8220;Get up.&#8221; So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to  my wife, I said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the  Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Did  the Prophet ask you (how much food you had)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the  Prophet said, &#8220;Enter and do not throng.&#8221; The Prophet started cutting the bread  (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven  whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take  the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his  companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the  Prophet said (to my wife), &#8220;Eat and present to others as the people are struck with  hunger.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Trench was dug, I saw the Prophet in the state of  severe hunger. So I returned to my wife and said, &#8220;Have you got anything (to eat),  for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a state of severe hunger.&#8221; She brought out for me,  a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I  slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my  job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an  earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . My wife said, &#8220;Do not  disgrace me in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and those who are with him.&#8221; So I went to him  and said to him secretly, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e.  kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and  another person along with you.&#8221; The Prophet raised his voice and said, &#8220;O people  of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough  till I come.&#8221; So I came (to my house) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle too, came, proceeding  before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, &#8220;May Allah do so-and-so to  you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have told the Prophet of what you said.&#8221; Then she brought  out to him (i.e. the Prophet the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Allah&#8217;s  Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and  invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake  along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not  put it down from its fireplace.&#8221; They were one-thousand (who took their meals), and  by Allah they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was  still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being  baked as if nothing had been taken from it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet returned from Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and  laid down his arms and took a bath, Gabriel came and said (to the Prophet ), You have laid  down your arms? By Allah, we angels have not laid them down yet. So set out for  them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Where to go?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;Towards this  side,&#8221; pointing towards Banu Quraiza. So the Prophet went out towards them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As if I am just now looking at the dust rising in the  street of Banu Ghanm (in Medina) because of the marching of Gabriel&#8217;s regiment when  Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out to Banu Quraiza (to attack them). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. Clans) the Prophet said,  &#8220;None of you Muslims) should offer the &#8216;Asr prayer but at Banu Quraiza&#8217;s place.&#8221;  The &#8216;Asr prayer became due for some of them on the way. Some of those said, &#8220;We will  not offer it till we reach it, the place of Banu Quraiza,&#8221; while some others said,  &#8220;No, we will pray at this spot, for the Prophet did not mean that for us.&#8221; Later  on It was mentioned to the Prophet and he did not berate any of the two groups. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some (of the Ansar) used to present date palm trees to the  Prophet till Banu Quraiza and Banu An-Nadir were conquered (then he returned to the people  their date palms). My people ordered me to ask the Prophet to return some or all the date  palms they had given to him, but the Prophet had given those trees to Um Aiman. On that,  Um Aiman came and put the garment around my neck and said, &#8220;No, by Him except Whom  none has the right to be worshipped, he will not return those trees to you as he (i.e. the  Prophet ) has given them to me.&#8221; The Prophet go said (to her), &#8220;Return those  trees and I will give you so much (instead of them).&#8221; But she kept on refusing,  saying, &#8220;No, by Allah,&#8221; till he gave her ten times the number of her date palms.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of (Banu) Quraiza agreed to accept the verdict  of Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh. So the Prophet sent for Sad, and the latter came (riding) a donkey and  when he approached the Mosque, the Prophet said to the Ansar, &#8220;Get up for your chief  or for the best among you.&#8221; Then the Prophet said (to Sad).&#8221; These (i.e. Banu  Quraiza) have agreed to accept your verdict.&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Kill their (men)  warriors and take their offspring as captives, &#8220;On that the Prophet said, &#8220;You  have judged according to Allah&#8217;s Judgment,&#8221; or said, &#8220;according to the King&#8217;s  judgment.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 448: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a  man from Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-&#8216;Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man was Hibban  bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai who shot an arrow at Sad&#8217;s  medial arm vein (or main artery of the arm). The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the  Mosque so that he might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from  the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath Gabriel  came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking the dust off his head, and said, &#8220;You  have laid down the arms?&#8221; By Allah, I have not laid them down. Go out to them (to  attack them).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Where?&#8221; Gabriel pointed towards Bani  Quraiza. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They  then surrendered to the Prophet&#8217;s judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict  concerning them. Sad said, &#8220;I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed,  their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties  distributed.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;Sad said, &#8220;O Allah! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to  fight in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned him out (of  Mecca). O Allah! I think you have put to an end the fight between us and them (i.e.  Quraish infidels). And if there still remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then  keep me alive till I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to  an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.&#8217; So blood gushed from the  wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the  blood flowing towards them . They said, &#8216;O people of the tent! What is this thing which is  coming to us from your side?&#8217; Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of Sad&#8217;s wound. Sad  then died because of that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa said, &#8220;We went out in the company of the  Prophet for a Ghazwa and we were six persons having one camel which we rode in rotation.  So, (due to excessive walking) our feet became thin and my feet became thin and my nail  dropped, and we used to wrap our feet with the pieces of cloth, and for this reason, the  Ghazwa was named Dhat-ur-Riqa as we wrapped our feet with rags.&#8221; When Abu- Musa  narrated this (Hadith), he felt regretful to do so and said, as if he disliked to have  disclosed a good deed of his. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(describing the Fear prayer): The Imam stands up facing the  Qibla and one batch of them (i.e. the army) (out of the two) prays along with him and the  other batch faces the enemy. The Imam offers one Rak&#8217;a with the first batch they  themselves stand up alone and offer one bowing and two prostrations while they are still  in their place, and then go away to relieve the second batch, and the second batch comes  (and takes the place of the first batch in the prayer behind the Imam) and he offers the  second Rak&#8217;a with them. So he completes his two-Rak&#8217;at and then the second batch bows and  prostrates two prostrations (i.e. complete their second Rak&#8217;a and thus all complete their  prayer) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he fought in a Ghazwa towards Najd along with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned, he too, returned along with him. The time of  the afternoon nap overtook them when they were in a valley full of thorny trees. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle dismounted and the people dispersed amongst the thorny trees, seeking the shade of  the trees. Allah&#8217;s Apostle took shelter under a Samura tree and hung his sword on it. We  slept for a while when Allah&#8217;s Apostle suddenly called us, and we went to him, to find a  bedouin sitting with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This (bedouin) took my sword out of  its sheath while I was asleep. When I woke up, the naked sword was in his hand and he said  to me, &#8216;Who can save you from me?, I replied, &#8216;Allah.&#8217; Now here he is sitting.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not punish him (for that). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Through another group of narrators, Jabir said, &#8220;We  were in the company of the Prophet (during the battle of) Dhat-ur-Riqa&#8217;, and we came  across a shady tree and we left it for the Prophet (to take rest under its shade). A man  from the pagans came while the Prophet&#8217;s sword was hanging on the tree. He took it out of  its sheath secretly and said (to the Prophet ), &#8216;Are you afraid of me?&#8217; The Prophet said,  &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Who can save you from me?&#8217; The Prophet said, Allah.&#8217; The companions of the  Prophet threatened him, then the Iqama for the prayer was announced and the Prophet  offered a two Rakat Fear prayer with one of the two batches, and that batch went aside and  he offered two Rak&#8217;a-t with the other batch. So the Prophet offered four Rakat but the  people offered two Rakat only.&#8221; (The sub-narrator) Abu Bishr added, &#8220;The man was  Ghaurath bin Al-Harith and the battle was waged against Muharib Khasafa.&#8221; Jabir  added, &#8220;We were with the Prophet at Nakhl and he offered the Fear prayer.&#8221; Abu  Huraira said, &#8220;I offered the Fear prayer with the Prophet during the Ghazwa (i.e. the  battle) of Najd.&#8221; Abu Huraira came to the Prophet during the day of Khaibar. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I entered the Mosque and saw Abu Said Al-Khudri and sat  beside him and asked him about Al-Azl (i.e. coitus interruptus). Abu Said said, &#8220;We  went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the Ghazwa of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we received captives  from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we  loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus interrupt us, we said,  &#8216;How can we do coitus interruptus before asking Allah&#8217;s Apostle who is present among  us?&#8221; We asked (him) about it and he said, &#8216;It is better for you not to do so, for if  any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.&#8221; </font></p>

The people dispersed amongst the trees in order to have shade. While we  were in this state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called us and we came and found a bedouin sitting in  front of him. The Prophet said, &#8220;This (Bedouin) came to me while I was asleep, and he  took my sword stealthily. I woke up while he was standing by my head, holding my sword  without its sheath. He said, &#8216;Who will save you from me?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah.&#8217; So he  sheathed it (i.e. the sword) and sat down, and here he is.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle did  not punish him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 462: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he  used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take with him the one on  whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat which he fought. The lot  fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the  women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried  down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night  that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and  went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to  my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar  beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to  look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who  used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel  on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were  light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in  abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the  lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a  young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my  necklace after the army had gone. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of  them, nor one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place where I used  to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back to me (in my search). While I was  sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal  As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he  saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me  before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited  Istirja&#8217; (i.e. &#8220;Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji&#8217;un&#8221;) as soon as he recognized  me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single  word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja&#8217;. He dismounted from his  camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode  on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in  the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the  event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk  (i.e. slander) more, was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(Urwa said, &#8220;The people propagated the slander and  talked about it in his (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it  and asked about it to let it prevail.&#8221; Urwa also added, &#8220;None was mentioned as  members of the slanderous group besides (&#8216;Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah  bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but  they were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander  was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha disliked to have Hassan  abused in her presence and she used to say, &#8216;It was he who said: My father and his (i.e.  my father&#8217;s) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad&#8217;s honor from  you.&#8221;). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;After we returned to Medina, I became  ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while  I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not  receiving the same kindness from Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick.  (But now) Allah&#8217;s Apostle would only come, greet me and say,&#8217; How is that (lady)?&#8217; and  leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went  out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi&#8217; where we used to  answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except  at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our  concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old &#8216;Arabs living in  the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and  Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was  the daughter of Sakhr bin &#8216;Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was  Mistah bin Uthatha bin &#8216;Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my  house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her  foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined!&#8217; I said,  &#8216;What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?&#8217;  On that she said, &#8216;O you Hantah! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? &#8216;I said,  &#8216;What did he say?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my  ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after  greeting me, said, &#8216;How is that (lady)?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8217;  as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me (and I went  to my parents) and asked my mother, &#8216;O mother! What are the people talking about?&#8217; She  said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by  her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would  find faults with her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the  people really talking in this way?&#8217; I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither  stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine  Inspiration was delayed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin  Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my  innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama said, &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.&#8217; &#8216;Ali bin  Abi Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are  plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.&#8217; On  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, &#8216;O Barira! Did you  ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?&#8217; Barira said to him, &#8216;By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal,  except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that  the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, on that day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up on the pulpit and  complained about &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, &#8216;O you  Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about  my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man  about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&#8217;  Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh the brother of Banu &#8216;Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I  will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head  off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill  your order.&#8217; On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his  branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was  a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu&#8217;adh). &#8216;By  Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your  people, you would not wish him to be killed.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin  Mu&#8217;adh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8216;By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill  him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.&#8217; On this, the two tribes  of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till they  became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing,  and I could never sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two  nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that  my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was  weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and  when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of  the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, &#8216;Amma Badu, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been  informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your  innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for  forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah  accepts his repentance.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased  flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my  father, &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; My father  said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Then I said to my mother,  &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah,  I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; In spite of the fact that I was a young  girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8216;By Allah, no doubt I know that you  heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and  you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe  me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely  believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph&#8217;s father  when he said, &#8216;(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is  Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the other side and lay on my  bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my  innocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine  Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be  talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might  have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to  overtake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body  like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was because of the weighty statement which  was being revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, he got up smiling,  and the first word he said was, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!&#8217; Then my  Mother said to me, &#8216;Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle). I replied, &#8216;By Allah, I  will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:&#8211;  &#8220;Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;  (24.11-20) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my  innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of  his relationship to him and his poverty, said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give to Mistah bin  Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.&#8217; Then Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those among you who are good and wealthy  swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have  left their homes for Allah&#8217;s cause, let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that  Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8216;Yes, by Allah, I would like that  Allah forgive me.&#8217; and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him before. He also  added, &#8216;By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at all.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha further said:.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked  Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, &#8216;What do you know and  what did you see?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain from claiming  falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about  &#8216;Aisha).&#8217; From amongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the  love she received from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her  piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with  those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand  my soul is, I have never uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.&#8217; Later on the man  was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

On that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle hear about that?&#8221; She replies,  &#8220;yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And Abu Bakr too?&#8221; She replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Aisha fell down fainting, and when she came to her senses, she  had got fever with rigors. I put her clothes over her and covered her. The Prophet came  and asked, &#8220;What is wrong with this (lady)?&#8221; Um Ruman replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! She (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) has got temperature with rigors.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Perhaps  it is because of the story that has been talked about?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha sat up and said, &#8220;By Allah, if I took an oath (that I am innocent), you would  not believe me, and if I said (that I am not innocent), you would not excuse me. My and  your example is like that of Jacob and his sons (as Jacob said ): &#8216;It is Allah (Alone)  Whose Help can be sought against that you assert.&#8217; Um Ruman said, &#8220;The Prophet then  went out saying nothing. Then Allah declared her innocence. On that, &#8216;Aisha said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;I thank Allah only; thank neither anybody else nor you.&#8221; </font></p>

On the day of Al-Hudaibiya we were fourteen hundred men  along with the Prophet Al-Hudaibiya was a well, the water of which we used up leaving not  a single drop of water in it. When the Prophet was informed of that, he came and sat on  its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution from it, rinsed (his  mouth), invoked (Allah), and poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for  a while and then the well brought forth what we required of water for ourselves and our  riding animals. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I set out for Hajj, I passed by some people offering a  prayer, I asked, &#8220;What is this mosque?&#8221; They said, &#8220;This is the Tree where  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took the Ar-Ridwan Pledge of allegiance. Then I went to Sa&#8217;id bin Musaiyab  and informed him about it. Said said, &#8220;My father said that he was amongst those who  had given the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle beneath the Tree. He (i.e. my  father) said, &#8220;When we set out the following year, we forgot the Tree and were unable  to recognize it. &#8220;Then Said said (perhaps ironically) &#8220;The companions of the  Prophet could not recognize it; nevertheless, you do recognize it; therefore you have a  better knowledge.&#8221; </font></p>

I had hardly waited for a moment when I heard somebody calling me. I said, &#8216;I  was afraid that something might have been revealed about me.&#8217; Then I came to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and greeted him. He (i.e. the Prophet) said, &#8216;Tonight there has been revealed to  me, a Sura which is dearer to me than (all the world) on which the sun rises,&#8217; and then he  recited: &#8216;Verily!

The Prophet proceeded on till he reached (a village called)  Ghadir-al-Ashtat. There his spy came and said, &#8220;The Quraish (infidels) have collected  a great number of people against you, and they have collected against you the Ethiopians,  and they will fight with you, and will stop you from entering the Ka&#8217;ba and prevent  you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O people! Give me your opinion. Do you recommend that I  should destroy the families and offspring of those who want to stop us from the Ka&#8217;ba? If  they should come to us (for peace) then Allah will destroy a spy from the pagans, or  otherwise we will leave them in a miserable state.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah Apostle! You have come with the intention of visiting this House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) and  you do not want to kill or fight anybody. So proceed to it, and whoever should stop us  from it, we will fight him.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed on, in the Name  of Allah !&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama relating one of the events that happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the &#8216;Umra of  Al-Hudaibiya. They said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded the truce with Suhail bin  &#8216;Amr on the day of Al-Hudaibiya, one of the conditions which Suhail bin &#8216;Amr stipulated,  was his saying (to the Prophet), &#8220;If anyone from us (i.e. infidels) ever comes to  you, though he has embraced your religion, you should return him to us, and should not  interfere between us and him.&#8221; Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on this condition. The believers disliked this condition and got disgusted  with it and argued about it. But when Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on that condition, Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded it. Accordingly, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then returned Abu Jandal bin Suhail to his father, Suhail bin &#8216;Amr, and returned  every man coming to him from them during that period even if he was a Muslim. The  believing women Emigrants came (to Medina) and Um Kulthum, the daughter of &#8216;Uqba bin Abi  Mu&#8217;ait was one of those who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was an adult at that time. Her  relatives came, asking Allah&#8217;s Apostle to return her to them, and in this connection,  Allah revealed the Verses dealing with the believing (women). Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to test all the believing women who migrated to him, with the following  Verse:&#8211; &#8220;O Prophet! When the believing Women come to you, to give the pledge of  allegiance to you.&#8221; (60.12) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Urwa&#8217;s uncle said, &#8220;We were informed when Allah  ordered His Apostle to return to the pagans what they had given to their wives who lately  migrated (to Medina) and we were informed that Abu Basir&#8230;&#8221; relating the whole  narration. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam  before &#8216;Umar. This is not true. What happened is that &#8216;Umar sent &#8216;Abdullah to bring his  horse from an Ansari man so as to fight on it. At that time the people were giving the  Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle near the Tree, and &#8216;Umar was not aware of that. So  Abdullah (bin Umar) gave the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the  horse and brought it to &#8216;Umar. While &#8216;Umar was putting on the armor to get ready for  fighting, &#8216;Abdullah informed him that the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beneath the Tree. So &#8216;Umar set out and &#8216;Abdullah accompanied him till he  gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and it was this event that made people  say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam before &#8216;Umar. &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar added,  &#8220;The people were along with the Prophet on the day of Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the  shade of the trees. Suddenly the people surrounded the Prophet and started looking at  him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah! Go and see why the people are encircling Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and looking at him.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar then saw the people giving the Pledge  o allegiance to the Prophet. So he also gave the Pledge of allegiance and returned to  &#8216;Umar who went out in his turn and gave the Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet.&#8217; </font></p>

We are  the owners of milch livestock (i.e. bedouins) and not farmers (i.e. countrymen).&#8221;  They found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they  should be provided with some milch camels and a shepherd and ordered them to go out of  Medina and to drink the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine) So they set out and when they  reached Al-Harra, they reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam, and killed the  shepherd of the Prophet and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet, he  sent some people in pursuit of them. (So they were caught and brought back to the Prophet  ). The Prophet gave his orders in their concern. So their eyes were branded with pieces of  iron and their hands and legs were cut off and they were left away in Harra till they died  in that state of theirs. (See Hadith 234 Vol 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went (from Medina) towards (Al-Ghaba) before the  first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to graze at a place  called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me (on the way) and said,  &#8220;The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been taken away by force.&#8221; I asked,  &#8220;Who had taken them?&#8221; He replied &#8220;(The people of) Ghatafan.&#8221; I made  three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, &#8220;O Sabahah!&#8221; I made the  people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up  with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as  I was a good archer and I was saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, and today will  perish the wicked people.&#8221; I kept on saying like that till I restored the she-camels  (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet  and the other people came there, and I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I have stopped the  people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people)  after them now.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;! You have  over-powered them, so forgive them.&#8221; Then we all came back and Allah&#8217;s Apostle seated  me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out in the company of the Prophet in the year of  Khaibar, and when we reached As Sahba&#8217; which is the lower part of Khaibar, the Prophet  offered the Asr prayer and then asked the people to collect the journey food. Nothing was  brought but Sawiq which the Prophet ordered to be moistened with water, and then he ate it  and we also ate it. Then he got up to offer the Maghrib prayer. He washed his mouth, and  we too washed our mouths, and then he offered the prayer without repeating his abulution. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While  we were proceeding at night, a man from the group said to &#8216;Amir, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Won&#8217;t you  let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for  the people poetry that kept pace with the camels&#8217; footsteps, saying:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!  Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In  charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our  defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon  us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An  unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others&#8217; help  Against us.&#8221; The Prophet on that, asked, &#8220;Who is that (camel) driver (reciting  poetry)?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Akwa&#8217;.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on  him.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! has (martyrdom) been  granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; Then we reached and  besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims  conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the  Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, &#8220;What are these fires? For cooking what,  are you making the fire?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;(For cooking) meat.&#8221; He  asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They (i.e. people) said, &#8220;The meat of  donkeys.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the pots!&#8221; Some  man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots  instead?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Yes, you can do) that too.&#8221; So when the army files  were arranged in rows (for the clash), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was short and he aimed at the leg of  a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own  knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw  me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, &#8220;What is bothering you?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the  deeds of &#8216;Amir are lost.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever says so, is mistaken, for  &#8216;Amir has got a double reward.&#8221; The Prophet raised two fingers and added, &#8220;He  (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few &#8216;Arabs who  achieved the like of (good deeds) &#8216;Amir had done.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Khaibar at night and it was his  habit that, whenever he reached the enemy at night, he will not attack them till it was  morning. When it was morning, the Jews came out with their spades and baskets, and when  they saw him(i.e. the Prophet ), they said, &#8220;Muhammad! By Allah! Muhammad and his  army!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a  (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been  warned.&#8221; </font></p>

Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile)  nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned.&#8221; We  then got the meat of donkeys (and intended to eat it), but an announcement was made by the  announcer of the Prophet, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle forbid you to eat the meat of  donkeys as it is an impure thing.&#8221; </font></p>

The  Prophet had their warriors killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and his army) encountered the pagans and  the two armies.,, fought and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned to his army camps and the  others (i.e. the enemy) returned to their army camps. Amongst the companions of the  Prophet there was a man who could not help pursuing any single isolated pagan to strike  him with his sword. Somebody said, &#8220;None has benefited the Muslims today more than  so-and-so.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He is from the people of the  Hell-Fire certainly.&#8221; A man amongst the people (i.e. Muslims) said, &#8220;I will  accompany him (to know the fact).&#8221; So he went along with him, and whenever he stopped  he stopped with him, and whenever he hastened, he hastened with him. The (brave) man then  got wounded severely, and seeking to die at once, he planted his sword into the ground and  put its point against his chest in between his breasts, and then threw himself on it and  committed suicide. On that the person (who was accompanying the deceased all the time)  came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Why is that (what makes you say so)?&#8221; He said &#8220;It is  concerning the man whom you have already mentioned as one of the dwellers of the  Hell-Fire. The people were surprised by your statement, and I said to them, &#8220;I will  try to find out the truth about him for you.&#8221; So I went out after him and he was then  inflicted with a severe wound and because of that, he hurried to bring death upon himself  by planting the handle of his sword into the ground and directing its tip towards his  chest between his breasts, and then he threw himself over it and committed suicide.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;A man may do what seem to the people as the deeds of the  dwellers of Paradise but he is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and another may do what  seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from the  dwellers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

Some of the people were about to  doubt (the Prophet&#8217;s statement), but the man, feeling the pain of his wounds, put his hand  into his quiver and took out of it, some arrows with which he slaughtered himself (i.e.  committed suicide). Then some men amongst the Muslims came hurriedly and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true so-and-so has committed suicide.  &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;O so-and-so! Get up and make an announcement that none but a  believer will enter Paradise and that Allah may support the religion with an unchaste  (evil) wicked man. </font></p>

Allahu-Akbar!  None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to  them), &#8220;Lower your voices, for you are not calling a deaf or an absent one, but you  are calling a Hearer Who is near and is with you.&#8221; I was behind the riding animal of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he heard me saying. &#8220;There Is neither might, nor power but with  Allah,&#8221; On that he said to me, &#8220;O Abdullah bin Qais!&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Labbaik. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Shall I tell you a sentence which  is one of the treasures of Paradise&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We where afflicted with severe hunger on the day of  Khaibar. While the cooking pots were boiling and some of the food was well-cooked, the  announcer of the Prophet came to say, &#8220;Do not eat anything the donkey-meat and upset  the cooking pots.&#8221; We then thought that the Prophet had prohibited such food because  the Khumus had not been taken out of it. Some others said, &#8220;He prohibited the meat of  donkeys from the point of view of principle, because donkeys used to eat dirty  things.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to  Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were  (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu  Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my  people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met  Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet  at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the  people of the ship, &#8220;We have migrated before you.&#8221; Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who was one  of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife the Prophet . She had  migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. &#8216;Umar came to Hafsa while  Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais was with her. &#8216;Umar, on seeing Asma,&#8217; said, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She  said, &#8220;Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais,&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the  sea-faring lady?&#8221; Asma&#8217; replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We have migrated  before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Allah&#8217;s Apostle  &#8221; On that Asma&#8217; became angry and said, &#8220;No, by Allah, while you were with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones  amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I  will mention this to the Prophet and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add  something to it.&#8221; So when the Prophet came, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet &#8216;Umar  has said so-and-so.&#8221; He said (to Asma&#8217;), &#8220;What did you say to him?&#8221; Asma&#8217;s  aid, &#8220;I told him so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. &#8216;Umar) has not got  more right than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of) only one  migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward of) two migrations.&#8221;  Asma&#8217; later on said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa and the other people of the boat coming to me in  successive groups, asking me about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was  more cheerful and greater than what the Prophet had said about them.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Asma&#8217; said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa  requesting me to repeat this narration again and again.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;I recognize the voice of the group of Al-Ashariyun, when they recite the Qur&#8217;an,  when they enter their homes at night, and I recognize their houses by (listening) to their  voices when they are reciting the Qur&#8217;an at night although I have not seen their houses  when they came to them during the day time. Amongst them is Hakim who, on meeting the  cavalry or the enemy, used to say to them (i.e. the enemy). My companions order you to  wait for them.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

Then we departed with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle to the valley of Al-Qira, and at that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a slave  called Mid&#8217;am who had been presented to him by one of Banu Ad-Dibbab. While the slave was  dismounting the saddle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle an arrow the thrower of which was unknown, came  and hit him. The people said, &#8220;Congratulations to him for the martyrdom.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the sheet (of cloth)  which he had taken (illegally) on the day of Khaibar from the booty before the  distribution of the booty, has become a flame of Fire burning him.&#8221; On hearing that,  a man brought one or two leather straps of shoes to the Prophet and said, &#8220;These are  things I took (illegally).&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This is a strap, or  these are two straps of Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

Do not give him.&#8221; Abu Huraira then said (to the Prophet ) &#8220;This  is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal.&#8221; Sa&#8217;id&#8217;s son said, &#8220;How strange!

I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do not give them a share of the  booty.&#8221; on, that, Aban said (to me), &#8220;Strange! You suggest such a thing though  you are what you are, O guinea pig coming down from the top of Ad-Dal (a lotus tree)!  &#8220;On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O Aban, sit down ! &#8221; and did not give them any  share. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 546: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr  (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the  property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in  Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr  said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave,  is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.&#8217; By Allah, I  will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and will leave it  as it was during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to do.&#8221; So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she  became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died.  She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her  husband &#8216;Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral  prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect &#8216;Ali much, but after  her death, &#8216;Ali noticed a change in the people&#8217;s attitude towards him. So Ali sought  reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. &#8216;Ali had not given the  oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet&#8217;s death and  Fatima&#8217;s death). &#8216;Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;Come to us, but let nobody  come with you,&#8221; as he disliked that &#8216;Umar should come, &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr),  &#8220;No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;What  do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them&#8217; So Abu Bakr entered upon  them, and then &#8216;Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;We know well your  superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah  has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we  thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  .&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thereupon Abu Bakr&#8217;s eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu  Bakr spoke, he said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the  relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own  relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I  will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or  regulation which I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will  follow.&#8221; On that &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;I promise to give you the oath of  allegiance in this after noon.&#8221; So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he  ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of &#8216;Ali and  his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had  offered; Then &#8216;Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud,  praised Abu Bakr&#8217;s right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of  jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. &#8216;Ali added,  &#8220;But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and  that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel  sorry.&#8221; On that all the Muslims became happy and said, &#8220;You have done the right  thing.&#8221; The Muslims then became friendly with &#8216;Ali as he returned to what the people  had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr). </font></p>

But we take one Sa of these (dates of good quality)  for two or three Sa&#8217;s of other dates (of inferior quality).&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Do not do so, but first sell the inferior quality dates for money and then  with that money, buy Janib.&#8221; Abu Said and Abu Huraira said, &#8220;The Prophet made  the brother of Bani Adi from the Ansar as the ruler of Khaibar. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went out for the &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhal-Qa&#8217;da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to  conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days  only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote:  &#8220;This is the peace treaty, which Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The infidels said (to the Prophet), &#8220;We do not agree  with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have prevented  you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Erase (the name of) &#8216;Apostle of Allah&#8217;.&#8221;  &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never erase you (i.e. your name).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the writing sheet&#8230;and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got  it the following written! &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah, has concluded: &#8220;Muhammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed  swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a  person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he  should not forbid him.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the  allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to Ali and said &#8220;Tell your  companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished.&#8221; So  the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting &#8220;O  Uncle, O Uncle!&#8221; Ali took her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take the daughter  of your uncle.&#8221; So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) &#8216;Ali,  Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarreled about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I took her for she is the daughter  of my uncle.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my  wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my brother.&#8221; On that, the Prophet  gave her to her aunt and said, &#8220;The aunt is of the same status as the mother.&#8221;  He then said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;You are from me, and I am from you,&#8221; and said to Ja&#8217;far,  &#8220;You resemble me in appearance and character,&#8221; and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are  our brother and our freed slave.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said to the Prophet &#8216;Won&#8217;t you marry the  daughter of Hamza?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my foster  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out with the intention of performing  &#8216;Umra, but the infidels of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba, so the Prophet  slaughtered his Hadi (i.e. sacrificing animals and shaved his head at Al-Hudaibiya and  concluded a peace treaty with them (i.e. the infidels) on condition that he would perform  the &#8216;Umra the next year and that he would not carry arms against them except swords, and  would not stay (in Mecca) more than what they would allow. So the Prophet performed the  &#8216;Umra in the following year and according to the peace treaty, he entered Mecca, and when  he had stayed there for three days, the infidels ordered him to leave, and he left. </font></p>

The only cause  which prevented the Prophet from ordering them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf, was  that he pitied them. </font></p>

The letter was addressed from Hatib, bin Abi  Balta&#8217;a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to do.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib!

I was a person not belonging to Quraish  but I was an ally to them from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the  Emigrants who were with you, have got their kinsmen (in Mecca) who can protect their  families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor so that they might protect my  relatives as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this to renegade from my  religion (i.e. Islam) nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said to his companions.&#8221; As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you the  truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

He said,  &#8220;Who are these?&#8221; Abbas said, &#8220;They are the Ansar headed by Sad bin Ubada,  the one holding the flag.&#8221; Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day  of a great battle and today (what is prohibited in) the Ka&#8217;ba will be permissible.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan said., &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas! How excellent the day of destruction is! &#8220;Then came  another batch (of warriors) which was the smallest of all the batches, and in it there was  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions and the flag of the Prophet was carried by Az-Zubair  bin Al Awwam. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed by Abu Sufyan, the latter said, (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Do you know what Sad bin &#8216;Ubada said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What  did he say?&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Sad told a lie, but today Allah will give superiority to the Ka&#8217;ba and today the  Ka&#8217;ba will be covered with a (cloth) covering.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that his flag  be fixed at Al-Hajun. </font></p>

Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle  order you to fix the flag here?&#8217; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered Khalid bin Al-Walid to  enter Mecca from its upper part from Ka&#8217;da while the Prophet himself entered from Kuda.  Two men from the cavalry of Khalid bin Al-Wahd named Hubaish bin Al-Ash&#8217;ar and Kurz bin  Jabir Al-Fihri were martyred on that day. </font></p>

Allow me to tell you a statement which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the second day of the Conquest of Mecca. My two ears heard it and  my heart remembered it and my two eyes saw him when he said it. He (i.e. the Prophet)  praised Allah and then said, &#8216;Mecca has been made a sanctuary by Allah and not by the  people, so it is not lawful for a person, who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed  blood in it, or to cut its trees and if someone asks the permission to fight in Mecca  because Allah&#8217;s Apostle was allowed to fight in it, say to him; Allah permitted His  Apostle and did not allow you, and even he (i.e. the Apostle) was allowed for a short  period of the day, and today its (Mecca&#8217;s sanctity has become the same as it was before  (of old) so those who are present should inform those who are absent (this Hadith).&#8221;  Then Abu Shuraih, was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr say to you?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people,  and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, &#8220;What is wrong with the  people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, &#8220;That man  claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that  Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.&#8221; I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and  feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the &#8216;Arabs (other than Quraish)  delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say.&#8221;  &#8220;Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a  true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and  my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father  returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &#8220;By Allah, I have come to you from  the Prophet for sure!&#8221; The Prophet afterwards said to them, &#8216;Offer such-and-such  prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of  you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows  Qur&#8217;an most should, lead the prayer.&#8221; So they looked for such a person and found none  who knew more Qur&#8217;an than I because of the Quranic material which I used to learn from the  caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a  boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very  short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t  you cover the anus of your reciter for us?&#8221; So they bought (a piece of cloth) and  made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that  shirt. </font></p>

Ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; So  in the afternoon, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He  deserved and then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because  if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them  stole, they would apply (Allah&#8217;s) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s  soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand.&#8221; Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off.

It (i.e. fighting in it) was not made lawful to anyone  before me!, nor will it be made lawful to anyone after me, and it was not made lawful for  me except for a short period of time. Its game should not be chased, nor should its trees  be cut, nor its vegetation or grass uprooted, not its Luqata (i.e. Most things) picked up  except by one who makes a public announcement about it.&#8221; Al-Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib  said, &#8220;Except the Idhkhir, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, as it is indispensable for blacksmiths  and houses.&#8221; On that, the Prophet kept quiet and then said, &#8220;Except the Idhkhir  as it is lawful to cut.&#8221; </font></p>

At that time, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith was  holding the white mule of the Prophet by the head, and the Prophet was saying, &#8220;I am  the Prophet undoubtedly: I am the son of &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib.&#8221; </font></p>

The people of  Hawazin were good archers, and when we attacked them, they fled. But rushing towards the  booty, we were confronted by the arrows (of the enemy).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegate of Hawazin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  declaring their conversion to Islam and asked him to return their properties and captives,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and said to them, &#8220;There Is involved in this matter, the  people whom you see with me, and the most beloved talk to me, is the true one. So choose  one of two alternatives: Either the captives or the properties. I have been waiting for  you (i.e. have not distributed the booty).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had delayed the  distribution of their booty over ten nights after his return from Ta&#8217;if. So when they came  to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to return to them but one of the two, they  said, &#8220;We prefer to have our captives.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amongst the  Muslims, and praising Allah as He deserved, said, &#8220;To proceed! Your brothers have  come to you with repentance and I see (it logical) to return their captives. So, whoever  of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it. And whoever of you likes to stick to  his share till we give him from the very first booty which Allah will give us, then he can  do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We do that (i.e. return the captives) willingly as a  favor, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We do not know which of you  have agreed to it and which have not; so go back and let your chiefs forward us your  decision.&#8221; They went back and their chief&#8217;s spoke to them, and they (i.e. the chiefs)  returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him that all of them had agreed (to give up their  captives) with pleasure, and had given their permission (i.e. that the captives be  returned to their people). (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;That is what has reached me about  the captives of Hawazin tribe.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We set out along with the Prophet during the year of (the  battle of) Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception of the  Prophet and some of his companions) retreated (before the enemy). I saw one of the pagans  over-powering one of the Muslims, so I struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his  armor to be cut off. The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as  if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. Afterwards I followed &#8216;Umar  and said to him, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the Order  of Allah.&#8221; Then the Muslims returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after  overcoming the enemy) the Prophet sat and said, &#8220;Whoever had killed an Infidel and  has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging of the deceased e.g.  clothes, arms, horse, etc).&#8221; I (stood up) and said, &#8220;Who will be my  witness?&#8221; and then sat down. Then the Prophet repeated his question. Then the Prophet  said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, &#8220;Who will be my witness?&#8221;  and then sat down. The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet  said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?&#8221; So I narrated the whole story; A man said,  &#8220;Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please  compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No! By Allah, it will never  happen that the Prophet will leave a Lion of Allah who fights for the Sake of Allah and  His Apostle and give his spoils to you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken  the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!&#8221; So he gave it to me and I  bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the  first property I got after embracing Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Qatada: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a  Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the  Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the  Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off.  That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then  he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims  (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with  them. Suddenly I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, &#8220;What  is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the order of Allah&#8221; Then the  people returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the  killed man.&#8221; So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an  infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came  to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. A man  from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, &#8220;The arms of the  deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate  him for it (i.e. the spoils),&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, Allah&#8217;s Apostle will not give  it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah&#8217;s Lions  who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and gave  that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got  after embracing Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had finished from the battle of Hunain, he  sent Abu Amir at the head of an army to Autas He (i.e. Abu Amir) met Duraid bin As Summa  and Duraid was killed and Allah defeated his companions. The Prophet sent me with Abu  &#8216;Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and  fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, &#8220;O Uncle! Who shot you?&#8221; He pointed  me out (his killer) saying, &#8220;That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow).&#8221; So  I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and  started saying to him, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you be ashamed? Won&#8217;t you stop?&#8221; So that person  stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu  &#8216;Amir. &#8220;Allah has killed your killer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take out this arrow&#8221;  So I removed it, and water oozed out of the wound. He then said, &#8220;O son of my  brother! Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for me.&#8221; Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He  survived for a short while and then died. (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet  at his house, and found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted with  ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had their traces over his back  and sides. Then I told the Prophet about our and Abu Amir&#8217;s news and how he had said  &#8220;Tell him to ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; The Prophet asked for water,  performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Forgive &#8216;Ubaid, Abu  Amir.&#8221; At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet&#8217;s armpits. The Prophet then  said, &#8220;O Allah, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of Resurrection, superior to many  of Your human creatures.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for  me?&#8221; (On that) the Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah, forgive the sins of &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais and admit him to a nice entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;  Abu Burda said, &#8220;One of the prayers was for Abu &#8216;Amir and the other was for Abu Musa  (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of Hunain, Prophet favored some people  over some others (in the distribution of the booty). He gave Al-Aqra&#8217; one-hundred camels  and gave Uyaina the same, and also gave other people (of Quraish). A man said,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Pleasure was not the aim, in this distribution.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I will  inform the Prophet (about your statement).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow  Mercy on Moses, for he was troubled more this but he remained patient.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day (of the battle) of Hunain, the tributes  of Hawazin and Ghatafan and others, along with their animals and offspring (and wives)  came to fight against the Prophet The Prophet had with him, ten thousand men and some of  the Tulaqa. The companions fled, leaving the Prophet alone. The Prophet then made two  calls which were clearly distinguished from each other. He turned right and said, &#8220;O  the group of Ansar!&#8221; They said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Rejoice, for we are  with you!&#8221; Then he turned left and said, &#8220;O the group of Ansar!&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Labbaik! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Rejoice, for we are with you!&#8221; The Prophet at that  time, was riding on a white mule; then he dismounted and said, &#8220;I am Allah&#8217;s Slave  and His Apostle.&#8221; The infidels then were defeated, and on that day the Prophet gained  a large amount of booty which he distributed amongst the Muhajirin and the Tulaqa and did  not give anything to the Ansar. The Ansar said, &#8220;When there is a difficulty, we are  called, but the booty is given to other than us.&#8221; The news reached the Prophet and he  gathered them in a leather tent and said, &#8220;What is this news reaching me from you, O  the group of Ansar?&#8221; They kept silent, He added,&#8221; O the group of Ansar! Won&#8217;t  you be happy that the people take the worldly things and you take Allah&#8217;s Apostle to your  homes reserving him for yourself?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;If the people took their way through a valley, and the Ansar took their way through  a mountain pass, surely, I would take the Ansar&#8217;s mountain pass.&#8221; Hisham said,  &#8220;O Abu Hamza (i.e. Anas)! Did you witness that? &#8221; He replied, &#8220;And how  could I be absent from him?&#8221; </font></p>

Saba&#8217;na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another).&#8221; Khalid kept on killing  (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive.  When there came the day then Khalid ordered that each man (i.e. Muslim soldier) should  kill his captive, I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not kill my captive, and none of my  companions will kill his captive.&#8221; When we reached the Prophet, we mentioned to him  the whole story.

He (i.e. the commander) became angry and  said &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the Prophet order you to obey me!&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Collect fire-wood for me.&#8221; So they collected it. He said, &#8220;Make a  fire.&#8221; When they made it, he said, &#8220;Enter it (i.e. the fire).&#8221; So they  intended to do that and started holding each other and saying, &#8220;We run towards (i.e.  take refuge with) the Prophet from the fire.&#8221; They kept on saying that till the fire  was extinguished and the anger of the commander abated. When that news reached the Prophet  he said, &#8220;If they had entered it (i.e. the fire), they would not have come out of it  till the Day of Resurrection. Obedience (to somebody) is required when he enjoins what is  good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent Abu Musa and Muadh bin Jabal to Yemen.  He sent each of them to administer a province as Yemen consisted of two provinces. The  Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Facilitate things for the people and do not make things  difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard  on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to  carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near  (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once  Mu&#8217;adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his  companion Abu Musa. Mu&#8217;adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him  sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his  hands behind his neck. Mu&#8217;adh said to Abu Musa, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! What is  this?&#8221; Abu Musa replied. &#8220;This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing  Islam.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; Abu Musa  replied, &#8220;He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said,  &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed,  and he was killed. Then Mu&#8217;adh dismounted and said, &#8220;O Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do  you recite the Qur&#8217;an ?&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;I recite the Qur&#8217;an regularly at  intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu&#8217;adh?&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I sleep  in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for  my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me. So I seek Allah&#8217;s Reward for  both my sleep as well as my prayer (at night).&#8221; </font></p>

In our land there is an alcoholic drink (prepared)  from barley called Al-Mizr, and another (prepared) from honey, called Al-Bit&#8221;&#8216; The  Prophet said, &#8220;All intoxicants are prohibited.&#8221; Then both of them proceeded and  Mu&#8217;adh asked Abu Musa, &#8220;How do you recite the Quran?&#8221; Abu Musa replied, &#8220;I  recite it while I am standing, sitting or riding my riding animals, at intervals and  piecemeal.&#8221; Muadh said, &#8220;But I sleep and then get up. I sleep and hope for  Allah&#8217;s Reward for my sleep as I seek His Reward for my night prayer.&#8221; Then he (i.e.  Muadh) pitched a tent and they started visiting each other. Once Muadh paid a visit to Abu  Musa and saw a chained man. Muadh asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Abu Musa said,  &#8220;(He was) a Jew who embraced Islam and has now turned apostate.&#8221; Muadh said,  &#8220;I will surely chop off his neck!&#8221; </font></p>

And if they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them  five prayers to be performed every day and night. And if they obey you in that, then tell  them that Allah has enjoined on them Sadaqa (i.e. Rakat) to be taken from the rich amongst  them and given to the poor amongst them.

Don&#8217;t take their best properties (as Zakat) and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed  person as there is no screen between his invocation and Allah. </font></p>

On that, one of his companions said, &#8220;We are  more deserving of this (gold) than these (persons).&#8221; When that news reached the  Prophet , he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you trust me though I am the truth worthy man of the One in  the Heavens, and I receive the news of Heaven (i.e. Divine Inspiration) both in the  morning and in the evening?&#8221; There got up a man with sunken eyes, raised cheek bones,  raised forehead, a thick beard, a shaven head and a waist sheet that was tucked up and he  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Be afraid of Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to  you! Am I not of all the people of the earth the most entitled to fear Allah?&#8221; Then  that man went away.

(They will neither  understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e. Islam) as an arrow  goes through a game&#8217;s body.&#8221; I think he also said, &#8220;If I should be present at  their time I would kill them as the nations a Thamud were killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey  the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

I said, &#8216;Whom (do you love) next?&#8217;  He replied, &#8220;Umar.&#8217; Then he counted the names of many men, and I became silent for  fear that he might regard me as the last of them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jarir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was at Yemen, I met two men from Yemen called Dhu  Kala and Dhu Amr, and I started telling them about Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Dhu Amr said to me,  &#8220;If what you are saying about your friend (i.e. the Prophet) is true, then he has  died three days ago.&#8221; Then both of them accompanied me to Medina, and when we had  covered some distance on the way to Medina, we saw some riders coming from Medina. We  asked them and they said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has died and Abu Bakr has been appointed  as the Caliph and the people are in a good state.&#8217; Then they said, &#8220;Tell your friend  (Abu Bakr) that we have come (to visit him), and if Allah will, we will come again.&#8221;  So they both returned to Yemen. When I told Abu Bakr their statement, he said to me,  &#8220;I wish you had brought them (to me).&#8221; Afterwards I met Dhu Amr, and he said to  me, &#8220;O Jarir! You have done a favor to me and I am going to tell you something, i.e.  you, the nation of &#8216;Arabs, will remain prosperous as long as you choose and appoint  another chief whenever a former one is dead. But if authority is obtained by the power of  the sword, then the rulers will become kings who will get angry, as kings get angry, and  will be delighted as kings get delighted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir bin Abdullah said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent troops  to the sea coast and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their commander, and they were  300 (men). We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food  ran short. So Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected,  and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our  daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that  we did not receive except a date each.&#8221; I asked (Jabir), &#8220;How could one date  benefit you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;We came to know its value when even that finished.&#8221;  Jabir added, &#8220;Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small  mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida  ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a  she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching  them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us who were three-hundred riders under  the command of Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah in order to watch the caravan of the Quraish  pagans. We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger  that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and  because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal  (i.e. a fish) called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on  our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and  healthy). Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the  tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, &#8220;He  took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from  underneath it (without touching it). &#8221; Jabir added: There was a man amongst the  people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then  slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Salih: Qais bin Sad said to his father.  &#8220;I was present in the army and the people were struck with severe hunger.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) (for them).&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;I did  slaughter camels but they were hungry again. He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered  (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt  hungry again.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais  said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again, but the people again felt hungry.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;But I was  forbidden (by Abu &#8216;Ubaida this time).&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Ubaida took (and fixed) one of its bones and a rider passed underneath  it (without touching it). (Jabir added:) Abu &#8216;Ubaida said (to us), &#8220;Eat (of that  fish).&#8221; When we arrived at Medina, we informed the Prophet about that, and he said,  &#8220;Eat, for it is food Allah has brought out for you, and feed us if you have some of  it.&#8221; So some of them gave him (of that fish) and he ate it. </font></p>

There are the Mudar pagans between you and us, so we cannot come to you except in  the sacred Months. So please teach us some orders on acting upon which we will enter  Paradise. Besides, we will preach that to our people who are behind us.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things (I order you):  To believe in Allah&#8230;Do you know what is to believe in Allah? That is to testify that  None has the right to be worshipped except Allah: (I order you also to offer prayers  perfectly to pay Zakat; and to fast the month of Ramadan and to give the Khumus (i.e.  one-fifth of the booty) (for Allah&#8217;s Sake).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn Abbas told him that Ibn  Abbas, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama sent him to &#8216;Aisha saying,  &#8220;Pay her our greetings and ask her about our offering of the two-Rak&#8217;at after &#8216;Asr  Prayer, and tell her that we have been informed that you offer these two Rakat while we  have heard that the Prophet had forbidden their offering.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;I  and &#8216;Umar used to beat the people for their offering them.&#8221; Kuraib added, &#8220;I  entered upon her and delivered their message to her.&#8217; She said, &#8216;Ask Um Salama.&#8217; So, I  informed them (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s answer) and they sent me to Um Salama for the same purpose as  they sent me to &#8216;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &#8216;I heard the Prophet forbidding the offering of  these two Rakat. Once the Prophet offered the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then came to me. And at  that time some Ansari women from the Tribe of Banu Haram were with me. Then (the Prophet )  offered those two Rakat, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, &#8216;Stand beside him  and say (to him): Um Salama says, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Didn&#8217;t I hear you forbidding the  offering of these two Rakat (after the Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?&#8217; And if he  beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.&#8217; So the lady slave did that and the  Prophet beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet finished  his prayer, he said, &#8216;O the daughter of Abu Umaiya (i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me  about these two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of &#8216;Abdul  Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two Rakat  which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two Rakat (you have seen me  offering) make up for those.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent some cavalry towards Najd and they brought  a man from the tribe of Banu Hanifa who was called Thumama bin Uthal. They fastened him to  one of the pillars of the Mosque. The Prophet went to him and said, &#8220;What have you  got, O Thumama?&#8221; He replied,&#8221; I have got a good thought, O Muhammad! If you  should kill me, you would kill a person who has already killed somebody, and if you should  set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful, and if you want property, then  ask me whatever wealth you want.&#8221; He was left till the next day when the Prophet said  to him, &#8220;What have you got, Thumama? He said, &#8220;What I told you, i.e. if you set  me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful.&#8221; The Prophet left him till the  day after, when he said, &#8220;What have you got, O Thumama?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  got what I told you. &#8220;On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Release Thumama.&#8221; So he  (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and  then entered the Mosque and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped  except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There  was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face  has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by  me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town  most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your  cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the &#8216;Umra. And now what  do you think?&#8221; The Prophet gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him  to perform the &#8216;Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, &#8220;You have become  a Sabian?&#8221; Thumama replied, &#8220;No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad,  Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Jamaica  unless the Prophet gives his permission.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet )  stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him,  &#8220;If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Allah&#8217;s  Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this  religion, then Allah will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown  to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my  behalf.&#8221; Then the Prophet went away from him. I asked about the statement of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle : &#8220;You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream,&#8221; and  Abu Huraira informed me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw (in a  dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired  Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles  flew away.

When the month of Rajab came, we used  (to stop the military actions), calling this month the iron remover, for we used to remove  and throw away the iron parts of every spear and arrow in the month of Rajab. Abu Raja&#8217;  added: When the Prophet sent with (Allah&#8217;s) Message, I was a boy working as a shepherd of  my family camels.

There came to him  Allah&#8217;s Apostle accompanied by Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick in his hand then.

Musailima said to him, &#8220;If you wish, we would not  interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the rule will be ours after you&#8230;  The Prophet said, &#8220;If you asked me for this stick, I would not give it to you. I  think you are the same person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin  Al-Qais who will answer you on my behalf.&#8221; The Prophet then went away.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;If the revenue of  Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so much and so much,&#8221; repeating &#8220;so  much&#8221; thrice. But the revenue of Al-Bahrain did not come till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  died. When the revenue came during the rule of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to  announce, &#8220;Whoever had any debt or promise due upon the Prophet, should present  himself to me (i.e. Abu Bakr). I came to Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet had  said (to me), &#8220;If the revenue of Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so-much and  so much,&#8221; repeating &#8220;so much&#8221; thrice. So Abu Bakr gave me (in another  narration Jaibir said,). I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him (to give me what the  Prophet had promised me) but he did not give me. I again went to him but he did not give  me. I again went to him (for the third time) but he did not give me; On that I said to  him, &#8220;I came to you but you did not give me, then I came to you and you did not give  me, and then again I came to you, but you did not give me; so you should either give me or  else you are like a miserly to me, on that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you say, &#8216;You are like  a miserly to me?&#8217; There is no worse disease than miserliness.&#8221; Abu Bakr said it  thrice and added, &#8220;Whenever I refused to give you, I had the intention of giving  you.&#8221; (In another narration) Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (and  he gave me a handful of money) and told me to count it, I counted and found it  five-hundred, and then Abu Bakr said (to me), &#8220;Take the same amount twice.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Musa invited the  man to the lunch, but the latter said, &#8220;I saw chickens (eating something (dirty) so I  consider them unclean.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come on! I saw the Prophet eating it  (i.e. chicken).&#8221; The man said &#8220;I have taken an oath that I will not ea  (chicken)&#8221; Abu Musa said.&#8221; Come on! I will tell you about your oath. We, a group  of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin people went to the Prophet and asked him to give us something to ride,  but the Prophet refused. Then we asked him for the second time to give us something to  ride, but the Prophet took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride. After a  while, some camels of booty were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that five camels be  given to us. When we took those camels we said, &#8220;We have made the Prophet forget his  oath, and we will not be successful after that.&#8221; So I went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217; Apostle ! You took an oath that you would not give us anything to ride, but  you have given us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for if I take an oath and later I see a  better solution than that, I act on the later (and gave the expiation of that oaths&#8221; </font></p>

Noah and  the prophets following him warned (their people) of him. He will appear amongst you (O  Muhammad&#8217;s followers), and if it happens that some of his qualities may be hidden from  you, but your Lord&#8217;s State is clear to you and not hidden from you. The Prophet said it  thrice. Verily, your Lord is not blind in one eye, while he (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) is blind in  the right eye which looks like a grape bulging out (of its cluster). No doubt,! Allah has  made your blood and your properties sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of  yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours.&#8221; The Prophet added: No doubt!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 688: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has taken its original shape  which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is of twelve months,  four of which are sacred, and out of these (four) three are in succession, i.e.  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Al-Muharram, and the fourth is Rajab which is named after the  Mudar tribe, between (the month of) Jumaida (ath-thania) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; Then the  Prophet asked, &#8220;Which is this month?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; On that the Prophet kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it  with another name. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We  replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; &#8220;We replied,  &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; On that he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the town of  Mecca?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, &#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which day is today?&#8221;  We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of  An-Nahr (i.e. sacrifice)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So your blood,  your properties, (The sub-narrator Muhammad said, &#8216;I think the Prophet also said: And your  honor..) are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this city of  yours, in this month of yours; and surely, you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you  about your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me, cutting the throats of one  another. It is incumbent on those who are present to convey this message (of mine) to  those who are absent. May be that some of those to whom it will be conveyed will  understand it better than those who have actually heard it.&#8221; (The sub-narrator,  Muhammad, on remembering that narration, used to say, &#8220;Muhammad spoke the  truth!&#8221;) He (i.e. Prophet) then added twice, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed  (Allah&#8217;s Message) to you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet visited me during Hajjat ul-Wada&#8217; while I was  suffering from a disease which brought me to the verge of death. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! My ailment has reached such a (bad) state as you see, and I have much wealth, but  I have no-one to inherit from me except my only daughter. Shall I give 2/3 of my property  as alms (in charity)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Shall I give  half of my property as alms?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;(Shall I give)  1/3 of it? &#8221; He replied, &#8221; 1/3, and even 1/3 is too much. It is better for you  to leave your inheritors wealthy rather than to leave them poor, begging people (for their  sustenance); and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s Sake, you will get reward for it even for  the morsel of food which you put in your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Should I remain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to  Medina)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you remain behind, any good deed which you will  do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will upgrade and elevate you. May be you will live longer so that  some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) may get harmed by you.&#8221;  The Prophet then added, &#8220;O Allah! Complete the Migration of my companions and do not  turn them on their heels. But the poor Sad bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sad) (died  in Mecca) .&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle pitied Sad for he died in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My Companions sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him for  some animals to ride on as they were accompanying him in the army of Al-Usra, and that was  the Ghazwa (Battle) of Tabuk, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! My companions have sent me  to you to provide them with means of transportation.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah! I will  not make you ride anything.&#8221; It happened that when I reached him, he was in an angry  mood, and I didn&#8217;t notice it. So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the  Prophet and for the fear that the Prophet might have become &#8216;angry with me. So I returned  to my companions and informed them of what the Prophet had said. Only a short while had  passed when I heard Bilal calling, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!&#8221; I replied to his  call. Bilal said, &#8220;Respond to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who is calling you.&#8221; When I went  to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, &#8220;Take these two camels tied together and also  these two camels tied together,&#8221;&#8216; referring to six camels he had brought them from  Sad at that time. The Prophet added, &#8220;Take them to your companions and say, &#8216;Allah  (or Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) allows you to ride on these,&#8217; so ride on them.&#8221; So I took those  camels to them and said, &#8220;The Prophet allows you to ride on these (camels) but by  Allah, I will not leave you till some of you proceed with me to somebody who heard the  statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which Allah&#8217;s  Apostle has not said.&#8221; They said to me, &#8220;We consider you truthful, and we will  do what you like.&#8221; The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of  them till they came to those who have heard the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle wherein he  denied them (some animals to ride on) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same.  So these people told them the same information as Abu Musa had told them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for Tabuk. appointing &#8216;Ali as his  deputy (in Medina). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Do you want to leave me with the children and  women?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Will you not be pleased that you will be to me like  Aaron to Moses?

So we came to the Prophet and he considered the biter&#8217;s claim as invalid (i.e.  the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor). The Prophet said, &#8220;Should  he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it were in the mouth of a  male camel to snap it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 702: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he  became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which  he failed to take part. Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any  Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa  of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them  (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of  Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not  exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the  people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had  never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that  Ghazwa. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then  at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to  hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of  that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long  journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims  clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he  informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied  by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221;  Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would  remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle  fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in  order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would  say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the  people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had  not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure)  one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure,  I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next  morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the  battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had  done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I  went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I  could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah  had excused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was  sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his  looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you  have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle kept silent.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the  Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of  false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the  advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle,  had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I  could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly  to speak the truth. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned  from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer  therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who  had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and  taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the  excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him, and  when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I  came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had  you not purchased an animal For carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other  than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking  fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek  your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell  you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.  Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or  wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards  this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up,  and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you  doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the  others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to  forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so  much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie,  but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of  them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied,  Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me  two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an  example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all  those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they  changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to  me as if I did not know it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards  my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest  of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with  the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and  I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not.  Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with  my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would  turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked  till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to  me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said,  &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He  kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I  asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it  better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the  wall.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw  a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in  Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out  for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the  following was written: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend  (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a  place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console  you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a  test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When  forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her  and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said  to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this  matter.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on  him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he  should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah,  he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you  also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife  of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked  him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217; Then I remained in that state for  ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the  time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the  Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting  in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened  to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the  voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab  bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah,  realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our  repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to  congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman  came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and  his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came  to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by  Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and  wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating  me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s  Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I  saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came  to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e.  Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for  Talha.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright  with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother  delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you  or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy,  his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of  him. When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my  repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has  saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth  as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped  fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from  telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin  (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and  deed).&#8221; (9.117-119) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His  guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for  Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to  anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you  when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the  rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed  altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He  took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left  our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to  the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our  failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by  the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before  him and he excused them by accepting their excuses. </font></p>

Some  said, &#8220;What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask  him ( to understand his state ).&#8221; So they went to the Prophet and asked him again.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me  for.&#8221; Then he ordered them to do three things. He said, &#8220;Turn the pagans out of  the &#8216;Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen  me dealing with them.&#8221; (Said bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn Abbas kept  quiet as rewards the third order, or he said, &#8220;I forgot it.&#8221;) (See Hadith No.  116 Vol. 1) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Book is  sufficient for us.&#8217; So the people in the house differed and started disputing.

So when their talk and  differences increased, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Get up.&#8221; Ibn Abbas used to say,  &#8220;No doubt, it was very unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise.&#8221;  </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s (curse be on the Jews and the Christians, as they took the graves of  their prophets as (places of worship),&#8217; intending to warn (the Muslims ) of what they had  done.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I argued with Allah&#8217;s Apostle repeatedly about that matter  (i.e. his order that Abu Bakr should lead the people in prayer in his place when he was  ill), and what made me argue so much, was, that it never occurred to my mind that after  the Prophet, the people would ever love a man who had taken his place, and I felt that  anybody standing in his place, would be a bad omen to the people, so I wanted Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to give up the idea of choosing Abu Bakr (to lead the people in prayer).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ali bin Abu Talib came out of the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle  during his fatal illness. The people asked, &#8220;O Abu Hasan (i.e. Ali)! How is the  health of Allah&#8217;s Apostle this morning?&#8221; &#8216;Ali replied, &#8220;He has recovered with  the Grace of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him,  &#8220;In three days you, by Allah, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Allah, I feel  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the  offspring of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib look at the time of their death. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as  to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new  ruler to take care of us.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah, if we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for  it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after  that. And by Allah, I will not ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Muslims were offering the Fajr prayer on Monday  and Abu Bakr was leading them in prayer, suddenly Allah&#8217;s Apostle lifted the curtain of  &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling and looked at them while they were in the rows of the prayers and  smiled. Abu Bakr retreated to join the row, thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come  out for the prayer. The Muslims were about to be put to trial in their prayer (i.e. were  about to give up praying) because of being overjoyed at seeing Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned them with his hand to complete their prayer and then entered the  dwelling and let fall the curtain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was one of the favors of Allah towards me that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle expired in my house on the day of my turn while he was leaning against my chest  and Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva at his death. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman entered upon me  with a Siwak in his hand and I was supporting (the back of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle (against my  chest ). I saw the Prophet looking at it (i.e. Siwak) and I knew that he loved the Siwak,  so I said ( to him ), &#8220;Shall I take it for you ? &#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I  took it and it was too stiff for him to use, so I said, &#8220;Shall I soften it for you  ?&#8221; He nodded his approval. So I softened it and he cleaned his teeth with it. In  front of him there was a jug or a tin, (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Umar is in doubt as to which  was right) containing water. He started dipping his hand in the water and rubbing his face  with it, he said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. Death has its  agonies.&#8221; He then lifted his hands (towards the sky) and started saying, &#8220;With  the highest companion,&#8221; till he expired and his hand dropped down. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his fatal illness,  used to ask, &#8216;Where will I be tomorrow? Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221;, seeking &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  turn. His wives allowed him to stay wherever he wished. So he stayed at &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house  till he expired while he was with her.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;The Prophet expired on  the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my  chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu  Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at  it and I said to him, &#8216;O &#8216;AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.&#8217; So he gave it to me and I cut  it, chewed it (it&#8217;s end) and gave it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who cleaned his teeth with it  while he was resting against my chest.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet expired in my house and on the day of my turn,  leaning against my chest. One of us (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s wives ) used to recite a prayer  asking Allah to protect him from all evils when he became sick. So I started asking Allah  to protect him from all evils (by reciting a prayer ). He raised his head towards the sky  and said, &#8220;With the highest companions, with the highest companions.&#8221;  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr passed carrying a fresh leaf-stalk of a date-palm and the  Prophet looked at it and I thought that the Prophet was in need of it (for cleaning his  teeth ). So I took it (from &#8216;Abdur Rahman) and chewed its head and shook it and gave it to  the Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it, in the best way he had ever cleaned his teeth,  and then he gave it to me, and suddenly his hand dropped down or it fell from his hand  (i.e. he expired). So Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva on his last day on earth  and his first day in the Hereafter. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh on a horse. He  dismounted and entered the Mosque, but did not speak to the people till he entered upon  &#8216;Aisha and went straight to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was covered with Hibra cloth (i.e. a kind  of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered the Prophet&#8217;s face and bowed over him and kissed him  and wept, saying, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah  will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come  upon you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: Abu Bakr went out while Umar bin  Al-Khattab was talking to the people. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Sit down, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But  &#8216;Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said,  &#8220;To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad , then Muhammad is dead,  but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.  Allah said:&#8211;&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle, and indeed (many) apostles have  passed away before him..(till the end of the Verse )&#8230;&#8230;Allah will reward to those who  are thankful.&#8221; (3.144) By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had  revealed this Verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and all the people received it from  him, and I heard everybody reciting it (then). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: Said bin Al-Musaiyab told me that &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and  I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had  died.&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8220;Let everyone present in the house  be given medicine by pouring it in his mouth while I am looking at him, except &#8216;Abbas as  he has not witnessed you (doing the same to me).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.053.324">Volume 4, Book 53, Number 324: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day  (of the battle) of Badr, and the Prophet had given me a she-camel from the Khumus. When I  intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I had an appointment with a  goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa&#8217; to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of  pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I  was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two  she-camels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after  collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their  flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of  my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done this?&#8221; The  people replied, &#8220;Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in  this house.&#8221; I went away till I reached the Prophet and Zaid bin Haritha was with  him. The Prophet noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet  asked. &#8220;What is wrong with you.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have  never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and  ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some  drunks.&#8221; The Prophet then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out  walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He  asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red.  Hamza looked at Allah&#8217;s Apostle and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he  raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at  his face. Hamza then said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you but the slaves of my father?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle realized that he was drunk, so Allah&#8217;s Apostle retreated, and we went out with  him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(mother of the believers) After the death of Allah &#8216;s  Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her  share of inheritance from what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained  without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8216;Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to  be used for charity).&#8221; Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and stopped  speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained  alive for six months after the death of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted  for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, &#8220;I will not leave  anything Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the  Prophet&#8217;s tradition, then I would go astray.&#8221; (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet&#8217;s  property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, but he withheld the properties of  Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, &#8220;These two properties are the Sadaqa which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is  to be entrusted to the ruler.&#8221; (Az-Zuhrl said, &#8220;They have been managed in this  way till today.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 53, Number 326: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot.  Suddenly the messenger of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and said, &#8220;The chief of the  believers has sent for you.&#8221; So, I went along with him till I entered the place where  &#8216;Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and  he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, &#8220;O Malik!  Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift  should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O man! Take it.&#8221; While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa&#8217; came  saying, &#8220;&#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, Az-Zubair and Sad bin Abi Waqqas are asking  your permission (to see you); may I admit them?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;, So they  were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa&#8217; came again  and said, &#8220;May I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; So, they  were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali).&#8221; They had a dispute  regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The  group (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge  between them and relieve both of them front each other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Be  patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our (i.e. prophets&#8217;) property will not be inherited, and  whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),&#8217; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself  (by saying &#8220;we&#8221;)?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned to  &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said so?&#8221; They replied, &#8221; He said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;So, I will  talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of  something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then recited the  Holy Verses: &#8220;What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them  &#8212; for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power  to His Apostles over whomever He will &#8216;And Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; 9:6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar added &#8220;So this property was especially given to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor  did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and  distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to  spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of  its revenue to be spent on Allah &#8216;s Cause. Allah &#8216;s Apostle kept on doing this during all  his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?&#8221; They replies in the affirmative.  &#8216;Umar then said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas. &#8220;I ask you by Allah, do you know this?&#8221;  &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, &#8216;Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the  same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and  rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him  and I became Abu Bakr&#8217;s successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first  two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do and  as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and  a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. &#8216;Ah and &#8216;Abbas) came to talk to me,  bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, &#8216;Abbas, came to me asking for  your share from your nephew&#8217;s property, and this man, i.e. &#8216;Ali, came to me asking for his  wife&#8217;s share from her father&#8217;s property. I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our  (prophets&#8217;) properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used  for charity).&#8217; When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I  said to you, &#8216;I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition  that you would take Allah&#8217;s Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in  charge of it.&#8217; So, both of you said (to me), &#8216;Hand it over to us,&#8217; and on that condition I  handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this  condition?&#8221; The group aid, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar faced &#8216;Ali and Abbas saying,  &#8220;I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes. &#8221; He said, &#8221; Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah,  by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other  than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to  me, and I will do the job on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The delegates of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul-Qais came and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and there is the infidels of the  tribe of Mudar intervening between you and us, so we cannot come to you except in the  Sacred Months. So please order us some instructions that we may apply it to ourselves and  also invite our people whom we left behind us to observe as well.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;I order you (to do) four (things) and forbid you (to do) four: I order you to  believe in Allah, that is, to testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah  (the Prophet pointed with his hand); to offer prayers perfectly; to pay Zakat; to fast the  month of Ramadan, and to pay the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth) of the war booty to Allah and I  forbid you to use Ad-dubba&#8217;, An-Naqir, Al-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat (i.e. utensils used for  preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) That she came to visit Allah&#8217;s  Apostle while he was in Itikaf(i.e. seclusion in the Mosque during the last ten days of  Ramadan. When she got up to return, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up with her and accompanied her,  and when he reached near the gate of the Mosque close to the door (of the house) of Um  Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by them and greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and then went away. Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed them saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry! (She is my  wife),&#8221; They said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (You are far away from  any suspicion),&#8221; and his saying was hard on them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Satan  circulates in the mind of a person as blood does (in his body). I was afraid that Satan  might put some (evil) thoughts in your minds.&#8221; </font></p>

By  Allah, if you give it to me, they will never be able to take it till I die.&#8221; When Ali  bin Abu Talib demanded the hand of the daughter of Abi Jahal to be his wife besides  Fatima, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle on his pulpit delivering a sermon in this connection  before the people, and I had then attained my age of puberty. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Fatima is from me, and I am afraid she will be subjected to trials in her religion  (because of jealousy).&#8221; The Prophet then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was from  the tribe of &#8216;Abu Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law, saying, &#8220;Whatever  he said was the truth, and he promised me and fulfilled his promise. I do not make a legal  thing illegal, nor do I make an illegal thing legal, but by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and the daughter of the enemy of Allah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can never get together (as  the wives of one man) (See Hadith No. 76, Vo. 5). </font></p>

The Prophet came to our house when we had gone to our beds. (On seeing the Prophet) we  were going to get up, but he said, &#8216;Keep at your places,&#8217; I felt the coolness of the  Prophet&#8217;s feet on my chest. Then he said, &#8220;Shall I tell you a thing which is better  than what you asked me for? When you go to your beds, say: &#8216;Allahu Akbar (i.e. Allah is  Greater)&#8217; for 34 times, and &#8216;Alhamdu Lillah (i.e. all the praises are for Allah)&#8217; for 33  times, and Subhan Allah (i.e. Glorified be Allah) for 33 times.

You are under Allah&#8217;s Order and I  am under Allah&#8217;s Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.&#8217; It was stopped till  Allah made him victorious. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it,  but it did not burn it. He said (to his men), &#8216;Some of you have stolen something from the  booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of allegiance by shaking hands  with me.&#8217; (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over the hand of their prophet.  Then that prophet said (to the man), &#8216;The theft has been committed by your people. So all  the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with  me.&#8217; The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said,  &#8220;You have committed the theft.&#8217; Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a  cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet added: Then  Allah saw our weakness and disability, so he made booty legal for us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he  called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, &#8220;O my son! Today one will be  killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an  oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will  be something left for us from our money?&#8221; Az-Zubair added, &#8220;O my son! Sell our  property and pay my debts.&#8221; Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and  willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sons. He said,  &#8220;One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts,  one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.&#8221; (Hisham, a  sub-narrator added, &#8220;Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of  Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and &#8216;Abbas. &#8216;Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that  time.&#8221; (The narrator &#8216;Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my  attention to his debts saying, &#8220;If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal  to my Master to help you.&#8221; By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I  asked, &#8220;O father! Who is your Master?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah (is my  Master).&#8221; By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say,  &#8220;Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .&#8221; and Allah would (help me  to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one  of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and  one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought  some money to deposit with him. Az Zubair would say, &#8220;No, (i won&#8217;t keep it as a  trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.&#8221; Az-Zubair was  never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but  he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took  part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, and &#8216;Uthman. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred  thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met Abdullah bin Zubair and asked,  &#8220;O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah kept it as a secret  and said, &#8220;One hundred thousand,&#8221; Hakim said, &#8220;By Allah! I don&#8217;t think your  property will cover it.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah said to him, &#8220;What if it is two  million and two hundred thousand?&#8221; Hakim said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can pay it; so  if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.&#8221; Az-Zubair had already bought  Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. &#8216;Abdullah sold it for one million and six  hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, &#8220;Any person who has any money  claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.&#8221; There came to him &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ja&#8217;far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair,  &#8220;If you wish I will forgive you the debt.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Ibn Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;If you wish you can defer the payment if you  should defer the payment of any debt.&#8221; Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah  bin Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;Give me a piece of the land.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to  him), &#8220;Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.&#8221; So, &#8216;Abdullah  bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt  perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to  Mu&#8217;awlya while &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam&#8217;a were sitting with  him. Mu&#8217;awiya asked, &#8220;At what price have you appraised Al-Ghaba?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;One hundred thousand for each share,&#8221; Muawiya asked, &#8220;How many shares have  been left?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Four and a half shares.&#8221; Al-Mundhir bin  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; &#8216;Amr  bin &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; Ibn  Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; Muawiya  said, &#8220;How much is left now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;One share and a  half.&#8221; Muawiya said, &#8220;I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty  thousand.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn  AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair&#8217;s sons said to him, &#8220;Distribute our  inheritance among us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among  you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, &#8216;Would those who have money claims on  Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.&#8221; So, he started to announce that  in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the  inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his  property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and  two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two  hundred thousand. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Hawazin delegation came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle after  they had embraced Islam and requested him to return their properties and war prisoners to  them, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;To me the best talk is the truest, so you may choose  either of two things; the war prisoners or the wealth, for I have delayed their  distribution.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had waited for them for over ten days when he returned  from Ta&#8217;if. So, when those people came to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to  return to them except one of the two things the said, &#8220;We choose our war Prisoners  &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up amongst the Muslims, and after glorifying Allah as He deserved,  he said, &#8220;Now then, these brothers of yours have come to us with repentance, and I  see it logical that I should return their captives to them, so whoever of you likes to do  that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to stick to his share,  let him give up his prisoners and we will compensate him from the very first Fai&#8217; (i.e.  war booty received without fight) which Allah will give us.&#8221; On that, all the people  said. &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles We have agreed willingly to do so (return the captives)&#8221;  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them &#8220;I do not know who amongst you has agreed to this  and who has not. You should return and let your leaders inform me of your agreement.&#8221;  The people returned and their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given the permission to  return the war prisoners (without Compensation)&#8221; (Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states)  This is what has been related to us about the captives of Hawazin. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once we were in the house of Abu Musa who presented a meal  containing cooked chicken. A man from the tribe of Bani Taim Allah with red complexion as  if he were from the Byzantine war prisoners, was present. Abu Musa invited him to share  the meal but he (apologised) saying. &#8220;I saw chickens eating dirty things and so I  have had a strong aversion to eating them, and have taken an oath that I will not eat  chickens.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along, I will tell you about this matter (i.e.  how to cancel one&#8217;s oat ). I went to the Prophet in the company of a group of  Al-Ashariyin, asked him to provide us with means of conveyance. He said, &#8216;By Allah, I will  not provide you with any means of conveyance and I have nothing to make you ride on.&#8217; Then  some camels as booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked for us saying. &#8216;Where  are the group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyun?&#8217; Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with  white humps. When we set out we said, &#8216;What have we done? We will never be blessed (with  what we have been given).&#8217; So, we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8216;We asked you to  provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us  with any means of conveyance. Did you forget (your oath when you gave us the camels)? He  replied. &#8216;I have not provided you with means of conveyance, but Allah has provided you  with it, and by Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on  I find that it is more beneficial to do something different, I will do the thing which is  better, and give expiation for my oath.&#8221; </font></p>

We got on board a ship which took  us to An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja&#8217;far bin Abu Talib and his companions  with An-Najaishi. Ja&#8217;far said (to us), &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has sent us here and ordered  us to stay here, so you too, stay with us.&#8221; We stayed with him till we all left  (Ethiopia) and met the Prophet at the time when he had conquered Khaibar. He gave us a  share from its booty (or gave us from its booty). He gave only to those who had taken part  in the Ghazwa with him. but he did not give any share to any person who had not  participated in Khaibar&#8217;s conquest except the people of our ship, besides Ja&#8217;far and his  companions, whom he gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people of the ship). </font></p>

Abu Bakr  ordered somebody to announce, &#8220;Any person who has money claim on Allah&#8217;s Apostle or  whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had promised something, should come to us.&#8221; So, I went to him  and said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much.&#8221; Abu Bakr  scooped up money with both hands thrice for me.&#8221; (The sub-narrator Sufyan illustrated  this action by scooping up with both hands and said, &#8220;Ibn Munkadir, another  sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in this way.&#8221;) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: Once I went to Abu Bakr and asked for the  money but he did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I went  to him for the third time and said, &#8220;I asked you, but you did not give me; then I  asked you (for the second time) and you did not give me; then I asked you (for the third  time) but you did not give me. You should either give me or allow yourself to be  considered a miser regarding my case.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;You tell me that I am a  miser with regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the  inclination to give you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up  money with both hands for me and asked me to count it. I found out that It was five  hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was standing in the row on the day (of the battle)  of Badr, I looked to my right and my left and saw two young Ansari boys, and I wished I  had been stronger than they. One of them called my attention saying, &#8220;O Uncle! Do you  know Abu Jahl?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, What do you want from him, O my nephew?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I have been informed that he abuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle. By Him in Whose Hands my  life is, if I should see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet  his fate.&#8221; I was astonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my attention  saying the same as the other had said. After a while I saw Abu Jahl walking amongst the  people. I said (to the boys), &#8220;Look! This is the man you asked me about.&#8221; So,  both of them attacked him with their swords and struck him to death and returned to  Allah&#8217;S Apostle to inform him of that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Which of you has  killed him?&#8221; Each of them said, &#8220;I Have killed him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;Have you cleaned your swords?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No. &#8221; He then looked at  their swords and said, &#8220;No doubt, you both have killed him and the spoils of the  deceased will be given to Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh.&#8221; The two boys were Muadh bin  &#8216;Afra and Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We set out in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day (of  the battle) of Hunain. When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan  throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him  on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so  violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released  me. I followed &#8216;Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), &#8220;What is wrong with the people  (fleeing)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;This is the Will of Allah,&#8221; After the people  returned, the Prophet sat and said, &#8220;Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof  of that, will posses his spoils.&#8221; I got up and said, &#8220;Who will be a witness for  me?&#8221; and then sat down. The Prophet again said, &#8220;Anyone who has killed an enemy  and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.&#8221; I (again) got up and said, &#8220;Who  will be a witness for me?&#8221; and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third  time. I again got up, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Abu Qatada! What is your  story?&#8221; Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me.  So please compensate him on my behalf.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8220;No, by  Allah, he (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of  Allah&#8217;s Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the spoils to me. I  sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and  this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam. </font></p>

This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it without greed, then one  is blessed in it, and if one takes it with greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and  will be like the one who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is  better than a lower (i.e. taking) hand,&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I will not ask anyone for anything after you till I leave this  world.&#8221; So, when Abu Bakr during his Caliphate, called Hakim to give him (some  money), Hakim refused to accept anything from him. Once &#8216;Umar called him (during his  Caliphate) in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it, whereupon &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Haklm) his right which Allah has assigned to him)  from this Fai &#8216;(booty), but he refuses to take it.&#8221; So Haklm never took anything from  anybody after the Prophet till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was accompanied  by the people on their way back from Hunain, the bedouins started begging things of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle so much so that they forced him to go under a Samura tree where his loose  outer garment was snatched away. On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and said to them,  &#8220;Return my garment to me. If I had as many camels as these trees, I would have  distributed them amongst you; and you will not find me a miser or a liar or a  coward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day (of the battle) of Hunain, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  favored some people in the distribution of the booty (to the exclusion of others); he gave  Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habis one-hundred camels and he gave &#8216;Uyaina the same amount, and also gave  to some of the eminent Arabs, giving them preference in this regard. Then a person came  and said, &#8220;By Allah, in this distribution justice has not been observed, nor has  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure been aimed at.&#8221; I said (to him), &#8220;By Allah, I will inform the  Prophet (of what you have said), &#8220;I went and informed him, and he said, &#8220;If  Allah and His Apostle did not act justly, who else would act justly. May Allah be merciful  to Moses, for he was harmed with more than this, yet he kept patient.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle made an announcement that  all the pots should be upset and that nobody should eat anything of the meat of the  donkeys. We thought that the Prophet prohibited that because the Khumus had not been taken  out of the booty (i.e. donkeys); other people said, &#8220;He prohibited eating them for  ever.&#8221; The sub-narrator added, &#8220;I asked Said bin Jubair who said, &#8216;He has made  the eating of donkeys&#8217; meat illegal for ever.&#8221;) </font></p>

When Allah&#8217;s Apostle led them in the  morning prayer and finished, the Ansar approached him, and he looked at them and smiled on  seeing them and said, &#8220;I feel that you have heard that Abu. &#8216;Ubaida has brought  something?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; He said, &#8220;Rejoice and hope  for what will please you! By Allah, I am not afraid of your poverty but I am afraid that  you will lead a life of luxury as past nations did, whereupon you will compete with each  other for it, as they competed for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar sent the Muslims to the great countries to fight the  pagans. When Al-Hurmuzan embraced Islam, &#8216;Umar said to him. &#8220;I would like to consult  you regarding these countries which I intend to invade.&#8221; Al-Hurmuzan said, &#8220;Yes,  the example of these countries and their inhabitants who are the enemies. of the Muslims,  is like a bird with a head, two wings and two legs; If one of its wings got broken, it  would get up over its two legs, with one wing and the head; and if the other wing got  broken, it would get up with two legs and a head, but if its head got destroyed, then the  two legs, two wings and the head would become useless. The head stands for Khosrau, and  one wing stands for Caesar and the other wing stands for Faris. So, order the Muslims to  go towards Khosrau.&#8221; So, &#8216;Umar sent us (to Khosrau) appointing An-Numan bin Muqrin as  our commander. When we reached the land of the enemy, the representative of Khosrau came  out with forty-thousand warriors, and an interpreter got up saying, &#8220;Let one of you  talk to me!&#8221; Al-Mughira replied, &#8220;Ask whatever you wish.&#8221; The other asked,  &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Al-Mughira replied, &#8220;We are some people from the Arabs; we  led a hard, miserable, disastrous life: we used to suck the hides and the date stones from  hunger; we used to wear clothes made up of fur of camels and hair of goats, and to worship  trees and stones. While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earths,  Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves  a Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord,  has ordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and  our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:&#8211; &#8220;Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e.  martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and  whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master.&#8221; (Al-Mughira, then blamed  An-Numan for delaying the attack and) An-Nu&#8217; man said to Al-Mughira, &#8220;If you had  participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he would not have  blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you. But I accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle  in many battles and it was his custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would  wait till the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e. after  midday).&#8221; </font></p>

Give me, for I gave the ransom of myself and Aqil.&#8221; The  Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take.&#8221; He scooped money with both hands and poured it in  his garment and tried to lift it, but he could not and appealed to the Prophet, &#8220;Will  you order someone to help me in lifting it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then  Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Then will you yourself help me carry it?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Al &#8216;Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not able  to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet &#8220;Will you order someone to help me  carry it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Then will you  yourself yelp me carry it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;No.&#8221; So, Al-&#8216;Abbas threw away  some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and went away. The Prophet kept on looking  at him with astonishment at his greediness till he went out of our sight.

He buried him and returned to Medina. &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sahl,  Muhaiyisa and Huwaiuisa, the sons of Mas&#8217;ud came to the Prophet and &#8216;Abdur Rahman intended  to talk, but the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Let the eldest of you speak.&#8221; as  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman was the youngest:. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman kept silent and the other two spoke. The  Prophet said, &#8220;If you swear as to who has committed the murder, you will have the  right to take your right from the murderer.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How should we swear if  we did not witness the murder or see the murderer?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the  Jews can clear themselves from the charge by taking Alaska (an oath taken by men that it  was not they who committed the murder).&#8221; The!y said, &#8220;How should we believe in  the oaths of infidels?&#8221; So, the Prophet himself paid the blood money (of &#8216;Abdullah).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Auf bin Mali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to the Prophet during the Ghazwa of Tabuk while he  was sitting in a leather tent. He said, &#8220;Count six signs that indicate the approach  of the Hour: my death, the conquest of Jerusalem, a plague that will afflict you (and kill  you in great numbers) as the plague that afflicts sheep, the increase of wealth to such an  extent that even if one is given one hundred Dinars, he will not be satisfied; then an  affliction which no Arab house will escape, and then a truce between you and Bani Al-Asfar  (i.e. the Byzantines) who will betray you and attack you under eighty flags.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr, on the day of Nahr (i.e. slaughtering of animals  for sacrifice), sent me in the company of others to make this announcement: &#8220;After  this year, no pagan will be allowed to perform the Hajj, and none will be allowed to  perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba undressed.&#8221; And the day of Al-Hajj-ul-Akbar is the day  of Nahr, and it called Al-Akbar because the people call the &#8216;Umra Al-Hajj-ul-Asghar (i.e.  the minor Hajj). Abu Bakr threw back the pagans&#8217; covenant that year, and therefore, no  pagan performed the Hajj in the year of Hajj-ul-Wada&#8217; of the Prophets. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We did not, write anything from the Prophet except the  Quran and what is written in this paper, (wherein) the Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a  sanctuary from (the mountain of) Air to so and-so, therefore, whoever innovates (in it) an  heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator, will incur the Curse of  Allah. the angels and all the people; and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of  worship will be accepted And the asylum granted by any Muslim Is to be secured by all the  Muslims even if it is granted by one of the lowest social status among them. And whoever  betrays a Muslim in this respect will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the  people, and his compulsory and optional good deeds of worship will not be accepted. And  any freed slave will take as masters (befriends) people other than his own real masters  who freed him without taking the permission of the latter, will incur the Curse of Allah,  the angels and all the people, and his compulsory and optional good deeds of worship will  not be accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Abu Wail, &#8220;Did you take part in the battle of  Siffin?&#8221; He said, &#8216;Yes, and I heard Sahl bin Hunaif (when he was blamed for lack of  zeal for fighting) saying, &#8220;You&#8217;d better blame your wrong opinions. I wish you had  seen me on the day of Abu Jandal. If I had the courage to disobey the Prophet&#8217;s orders, I  would have done so. We had kept out swords on our necks and shoulders, for a thing which  frightened us. And we did so, we found it easier for us, except in the case of the above  battle (of ours).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in Siffin and Sahl bin Hunaif got up and said,  &#8220;O people! Blame yourselves! We were with the Prophet on the day of Hudaibiya, and if  we had been called to fight, we would have fought. But &#8216;Umar bin Al Khatab came and said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Aren&#8217;t we in the right and our opponents in the wrongs&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t our killed persons in Paradise and their&#8217;s in  Hell?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Then why should we accept hard terms in matters  concerning our religion? Shall we return before Allah judges between us and them?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khattab! I am the Apostle of Allah and Allah will never degrade  me. Then &#8216;Umar went to Abu Bakr and told him the same as he had told the Prophet. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that Abu Bakr said (to &#8216;Umar). &#8216;He is the Apostle of  Allah and Allah will never degrade him.&#8217; Then Surat-al-Fath (i.e. Victory) was revealed  and Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited it to the end in front of &#8216;Umar. On that &#8216;Umar asked, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Was it (i.e. the Hudaibiya Treaty) a victory?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>During the period of the peace treaty of Quraish with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, my mother, accompanied by her father, came to visit me, and she was a  pagan. I consulted Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My mother has come to me and  she desires to receive a reward from me, shall I keep good relation with her?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Yes, keep good relation with her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet intended to perform the &#8216;Umra he sent a  person to the people of Mecca asking their permission to enter Mecca. They stipulated that  he would not stay for more than three days and would not enter it except with sheathed  arms and would not preach (Islam) to any of them. So Ali bin Abi-Talib started writing the  treaty between them. He wrote, &#8220;This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed  to.&#8221; The (Meccans) said, &#8220;If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the Apostle of  Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have followed you. But write, &#8216;This  is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed to..&#8217; &#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;By Allah, I am Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of &#8216;Allah.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used not to write; so he asked &#8216;Ali to erase the expression of Apostle of  Allah. On that &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah I will never erase it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  (to &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Let me see the paper.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali showed him the paper, the Prophet  erased the expression with his own hand. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had entered Mecca and three  days had elapsed, the Meccans came to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Let your friend (i.e. the  Prophet) quit Mecca.&#8221; Ali informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and then he departed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in the state of prostration,  surrounded by a group of people from Quraish pagans. &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait came and brought  the intestines of a camel and threw them on the back of the Prophet . The Prophet did not  raise his head from prostration till Fatima (i.e. his daughter) came and removed those  intestines from his back, and invoked evil on whoever had done (the evil deed). The  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, O Allah! Destroy Abu Jahl bin  Hisham, &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a. &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait &#8216;Umaiya bin Khalaf (or  Ubai bin Kalaf).&#8221; Later on I saw all of them killed during the battle of Badr and  their bodies were thrown into a well except the body of Umaiya or Ubai, because he was a  fat person, and when he was pulled, the parts of his body got separated before he was  thrown into the well. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the day of the conquest of Mecca,  &#8220;There is no migration now, but there is Jihad (i.e.. holy battle) and good  intentions. And when you are called for Jihad, you should come out at once&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle also said, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, &#8220;Allah has made this town a  sanctuary since the day He created the Heavens and the Earth. So, it is a sanctuary by  Allah&#8217;s Decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was not legal for anyone  before me, and it was made legal for me only for an hour by daytime. So, it (i.e. Mecca)  is a sanctuary by Allah&#8217;s Decree till the Day of Resurrection. Its thorny bushes should  not be cut, and its game should not be chased, its fallen property (i.e. Luqata) should  not be picked up except by one who will announce it publicly; and its grass should not be  uprooted,&#8221; On that Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except the Idhkhir,  because it is used by the goldsmiths and by the people for their houses.&#8221; On that the  Prophet said, &#8220;Except the Idhkhir.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is  the best deed?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed  times.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next in goodness?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To be good  and dutiful to your parents.&#8221; I further asked, what is next in goodness?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To participate in Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; I did not ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told me more. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 42: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is no Hijra (i.e.  migration) (from Mecca to Medina) after the Conquest (of Mecca), but Jihad and good  intention remain; and if you are called (by the Muslim ruler) for fighting, go forth  immediately. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.043"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 43: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(That she said), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We consider Jihad  as the best deed. Should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The best  Jihad (for women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the Prophet&#8217;s  tradition and is accepted by Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 44: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Instruct me  as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not find such  a deed.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the  battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break  your fast?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;But who can do that?&#8221; Abu- Huraira added,  &#8220;The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse  while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 45: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Somebody asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is the best  among the people?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied &#8220;A believer who strives his utmost in  Allah&#8217;s Cause with his life and property.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;A believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping Allah and  leaving the people secure from his mischief.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.046"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 46: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The example of a  Mujahid in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8211; and Allah knows better who really strives in His Cause&#8212;-is  like a person who fasts and prays continuously. Allah guarantees that He will admit the  Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his  home safely with rewards and war booty.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 47: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who  would offer him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, once  visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, &#8220;What causes  you to smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Some of my followers who (in a  dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause (on board a ship) amidst this  sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the  thrones).&#8221; (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet  used.) Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um  Haram asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Some  of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause,&#8221; repeating the  same dream. Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of  them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are amongst the first ones.&#8221; It happened that she  sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu&#8217;awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she  disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 48: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever believes in Allah and His  Apostle, offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted  Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah&#8217;s Cause or remains in the land  where he is born.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the  people with the is good news?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Paradise has one-hundred grades which  Allah has reserved for the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each  of two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask  Allah (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the best and highest part of  Paradise.&#8221; (i.e. The sub-narrator added, &#8220;I think the Prophet also said, &#8216;Above  it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of Beneficent (i.e. Allah), and from it originate the  rivers of Paradise.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 49: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two men came to me (in a  dream) and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house,  better of which I have never seen. One of them said, &#8216;This house is the house of  martyrs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 50: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor (of fighting) in  Allah&#8217;s Cause in the forenoon or in the afternoon is better than the world and whatever is  in it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.051"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 51: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A place in Paradise as small as a  bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world).&#8221; He  also said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is  better than all that on which the sun rises and sets.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 52: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause  in the afternoon and in the forenoon is better than the world and whatever is in it.&#8221;  </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.053"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 53: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody who dies and finds good from  Allah (in the Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given the  whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on seeing the superiority of  martyrdom, would like to come back to the world and get killed again (in Allah&#8217;s  Cause).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor  (of fighting) in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the  world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the bow or lash of one of you  is better than all the world and whatever is in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared  to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with  light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 54: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is!  Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and whom I  cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya&#8217;  (army-unit) setting out in Allah&#8217;s Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love  to be martyred in Al1ah&#8217;s Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and then  get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get resurrected again and then get  martyred. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.055"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 55: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;Zaid took  the flag and was martyred, and then Ja&#8217;far took the flag and was martyred, and then  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took  the flag though he was not appointed as a commander and Allah made him victorious.&#8221;  The Prophet further added, &#8220;It would not please us to have them with us.&#8221; Aiyub,  a sub-narrator, added, &#8220;Or the Prophet, shedding tears, said, &#8216;It would not p ease  them to be with us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.056"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 56: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Haram said, &#8220;Once the Prophet slept in my house  near to me and got up smiling. I said, &#8216;What makes you smile?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Some of my  followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings  on thrones.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; So the  Prophet invoked Allah for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and  told his dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said,  &#8220;Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are among the first  batch.&#8221; Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband &#8216;Ubada  bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval  expedition led by Mu awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to  Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus  she died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 57: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim  to the tribe of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them,  &#8220;I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close to me.&#8221; So he went  ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But while he was reporting the message  of the Prophet , they beckoned to one of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal  uncle said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! By the Lord of the Kaba, I am successful.&#8221; After  that they attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who went up  to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think another man was  saved along with him).&#8221; Gabriel informed the Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met  their Lord, and He was pleased with them and made them pleased. We used to recite,  &#8220;Inform our people that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made  us pleased &#8221; Later on this Quranic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked Allah for  forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam  Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and his Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 58: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundab bin Sufyan: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In one of the holy Battles a finger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (got  wounded and) bled. He said, &#8220;You are just a finger that bled, and what you got is in  Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 59: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my soul  is! Whoever is wounded in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8230;.and Allah knows well who gets wounded in His  Cause&#8230;.will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wound having the color of blood but  the scent of musk.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 60: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Abu Sufyan told him that Heraclius said to him,  &#8220;I asked you about the outcome of your battles with him (i.e. the Prophet ) and you  told me that you fought each other with alternate success. So the Apostles are tested in  this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 61: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of  Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought  against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt.  Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221; On the day of Uhud when the Muslims  turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologize to You for what these  (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have  done.&#8221; Then he advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said &#8220;O Sad bin Muadh ! By  the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain  of) Uhud,&#8221; Later on Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I cannot achieve or do what he  (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his  body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister  could recognize him by his fingers.&#8221; We used to think that the following Verse was  revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who  have been true to their covenant with Allah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; (33.23) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>His sister Ar-Rubbaya&#8217; broke a front tooth of a woman and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered for retaliation.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever spends two things in  Allah&#8217;s Cause, will be called by all the gate-keepers of Paradise who will be saying, &#8216;O  so-and-so! Come here.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Such persons will  never be destroyed.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I hope you will be one of them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;Nothing  worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly  blessings which will be conferred on you.&#8221; Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures.  He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?&#8221; The  Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the  people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked,  &#8220;Where is the present questioner?&#8221; &#8220;Do you think wealth is good?&#8221; he  repeated thrice, adding, &#8220;No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like  what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals  because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks  are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and  urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How  excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent  in Allah&#8217;s Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it  legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against  him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

I am coming just now,&#8217; and went on perfuming  himself with Hunut, then he came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people  fled from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, &#8216;Clear the way for me to fight the enemy.  We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. How bad the habits you  have acquired from your enemies!&#8221; </font></p>

He himself was not in the state of Ihram. They saw an opener before he could see  it. When they saw the opener, they did not speak anything till Abu Qatada saw it. So, he  rode over his horse called Al-Jarada and requested them to give him his lash, but they  refused. So, he himself took it and then attacked the opener and slaughtered it. He ate of  its meat and his companions ate, too, but they regretted their eating. When they met the  Prophet (they asked him about it) and he asked, &#8220;Have you some of its meat (left)  with you?&#8221; Abu Qatada replied, &#8220;Yes, we have its leg with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet took and ate it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of  three purposes; for some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a  means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The one for whom they are  a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for Allah&#8217;s Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a  long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area  of the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his  benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or two hillocks then all its  dung and its foot marks will be written as good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river  and drinks water from it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will  get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a source of sins, he  is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and showing enmity for  Muslims: such a horse will be a source of sins for him. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked  about donkeys, he replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this  unique, comprehensive Verse: &#8220;Then anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s)  weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s) weight of  evil, shall see it.&#8217; (101.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I called on Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Ansari and said to him,  &#8220;Relate to me what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  accompanied him on one of the journeys.&#8221; (Abu Aqil said, &#8220;I do not know whether  that journey was for the purpose of Jihad or &#8216;Umra.&#8221;) &#8220;When we were  returning,&#8221; Jabir continued, &#8220;the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever wants to return earlier  to his family, should hurry up.&#8217; We set off and I was on a black red tainted camel having  no defect, and the people were behind me. While I was in that state the camel stopped  suddenly (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, &#8216;O Jabir, wait!&#8217; Then he  hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, &#8216;Will you  sell the camel?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went  to the Mosque along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel on the  pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, &#8216;This is your camel.&#8217; He came out and  started examining the camel and saying, &#8216;The camel is ours.&#8217; Then the Prophet sent some  Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, &#8216;Give it to Jabir.&#8217; Then he asked, &#8216;Have you taken  the full price (of the camel)?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8216;Both the price and  the camel are for you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

What  makes you smile?&#8221; He replied, (I dreamt that) some people amongst my followers were  sailing on the green sea in Allah&#8217;s Cause, resembling kings on thrones.&#8221; She said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O  Allah! Let her be one of them.&#8221; Then he (slept again and woke up and) smiled. She  asked him the same question and he gave the same reply. She said, &#8220;Invoke Allah to  make me one of them.&#8221; He replied, &#8221;You will be amongst the first group of them; you  will not be amongst the last.&#8221; Later on she married &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit and then she  sailed on the sea with bint Qaraza, Mu&#8217;awiya&#8217;s wife (for Jihad).

Paradise is  for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in Allah&#8217;s Cause, with his hair unkempt  and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied  with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post  with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for permission he is  not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &#8220;Choose one of your boy  servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar.&#8221; So, Abu Talha took me letting me  ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I used to serve Allah&#8217;s  Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, &#8220;O Allah! I seek  refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness  and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men.&#8221; Then we  reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty  of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while  she was a bride. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him  till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,&#8217; where her menses were over and he took her  for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle folding a cloak  round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him)  He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the  camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and  said, &#8220;This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us.&#8221; Then he looked at  Medina and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains  a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of  Medina) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures).&#8221; </font></p>

Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;You  are amongst them.&#8221; He slept again and then woke up smiling and said the same as  before twice or thrice.

When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned to his camp and when the pagans returned to their  camp, somebody talked about a man amongst the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who would  follow and kill with his sword any pagan going alone. He said, &#8220;Nobody did his job  (i.e. fighting) so properly today as that man.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed,  he is amongst the people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;I  shall accompany him (to watch what he does)&#8221; Thus he accompanied him, and wherever he  stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he would run with him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided  to bring about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the ground  directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he leaned on the  sword and killed himself.

The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I said, &#8216;I will find  out his reality for you.&#8217; So, I came out seeking him. He got severely wounded, and  hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end  towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed  himself.&#8221; when Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A man may seem to the people as if he were  practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he is from the people of the  Hell) Fire, another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the  people of Hell (Fire), while in fact he is from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to my house while two girls were  singing beside me the songs of Bu&#8217;ath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the  Ansar, i.e. Khazraj and Aus, before Islam.) The Prophet reclined on the bed and turned his  face to the other side. Abu Bakr came and scolded me and said protestingly,  &#8220;Instrument of Satan in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle turned  his face towards him and said, &#8220;Leave them.&#8221; When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I  waved the two girls to go away and they left. It was the day of &#8216;Id when negroes used to  play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah&#8217;s Apostle or he himself  asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he  let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry  on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!&#8221; When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough.  I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The &#8216;Prophet was the best and the bravest amongst the  people. Once the people of Medina got terrified at night, so they went in the direction of  the noise (that terrified them). The Prophet met them (on his way back) after he had found  out the truth. He was riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha and a sword was  hanging by his neck, and he was saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid! Don&#8217;t be afraid!&#8221; He  further said, &#8220;I found it (i.e. the horse) very fast,&#8221; or said, &#8220;This horse  is very fast.&#8221; (Qastala-ni) </font></p>

You have asked Allah pressingly.&#8221; The Prophet was clad in his armor at that  time. He went out, saying to me: &#8220;There multitude will be put to flight and they will  show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense)  and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter (than their worldly failure).&#8221;  (54.45-46) Khalid said that was on the day of the battle of Badr. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a miser and the one  who gives in charity, is like the example of two men wearing iron cloaks so tightly that  their arms are raised forcibly towards their collar-bones. So, whenever a charitable  person wants to give in charity, his cloak spreads over his body so much so that it wipes  out his traces, but whenever the miser wants to give in charity, the rings (of the iron  cloak) come closer to each other and press over his body, and his hands gets connected to  his collar-bones. Abu Huraira heard the Prophet saying. &#8220;The miser then tries to  widen it but in vain.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam  and sent him his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to hand it over  to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar as a sign of gratitude to  Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory  over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Caesar, he said  after reading t, &#8216;Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present  here, in order to ask him about Allah&#8217;s Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in  Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that  had been concluded between Allah&#8217;s Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said,  Caesar&#8217;s messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and  we were admitted into Ceasar&#8217;s court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a  crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his  translator. &#8216;Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a  prophet.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;I replied, &#8216;I am the nearest relative to him.&#8217; He  asked, &#8216;What degree of relationship do you have with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He is my cousin,&#8217;  and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, &#8216;Let him  come nearer.&#8217; He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said  to his translator, &#8216;Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who  claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a  liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it  shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his  translator, &#8216;Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a  noble family amongst us.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same  before him? &#8216;I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he  claimed what he claimed? &#8216; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a  king?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Do the noble or the poor follow him?&#8217; I replied,  &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are they increasing or decreasing (day by  day)?&#8217; I replied,&#8217; They are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace  his (the Prophet&#8217;s) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?&#8217;. I replied,  &#8216;No. &#8216; He said, &#8216;Does he break his promises? I replied, &#8216;No, but we are now at truce with  him and we are afraid that he may betray us.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Other than the  last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, &#8216;Have you ever had  a war with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What was the outcome of your battles with  him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;  He said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He tells us to worship Allah alone, and  not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to  worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what  is entrusted to us.&#8217; When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, &#8216;Say to him: I  ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact,  all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you  whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the  negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man  was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever  blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a  person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about  Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the  negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted  to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people  followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the  followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or  decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true  faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who,  after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was  in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters  and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether  he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles;  they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he  fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and  sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory  is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to  worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your  fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep  promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a  prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that  he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the  earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go  immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;  &#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  was read. Its contents were:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most  Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to  Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then,  I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe;  embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this  invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your  nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we  worship. None but Allah, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none  of us shall take others as Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness  that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his  speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him,  and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned  out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them,  &#8216;Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha&#8217;s (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) affair has gained power. This is the King  of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I remained low and  was sure that his religion would be victorious till Allah converted me to Islam, though I  disliked it &#8221; </font></p>

But the Prophet  asked for &#8216;Ali. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he  ordered them to bring &#8216;Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes and his eyes  were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;We will fight  with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims).&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what  Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands  (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

So, when the day  dawned, the Jews came out with their bags and spades. When they saw the Prophet; they  said, &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; The Prophet said, Allahu&#8211;Akbar! (Allah is  Greater) and Khaibar is ruined, for whenever we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight)  then it will be a miserable morning for those who have been warned.&#8221; </font></p>

Beef was brought to us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering)  and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Somebody said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered (a  cow) on behalf of his wives.&#8221; </font></p>

And no doubt, everyone among you  will remain in a good state as long as he obeys Allah. If one is in doubt as to the  legality of something, he should ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a  time when you will not find such a man.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I participated in a Ghazwa along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle The  Prophet met me (on the way) while I was riding a camel of ours used for irrigation and it  had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet asked me, &#8220;What is wrong with  the camel?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;It has got tired.&#8221; So. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came from  behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and  going ahead of them. Then he asked me, &#8220;How do you find your camel (now)?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Will you sell it to me?&#8221; I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the  only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sell it to  me then.&#8221; I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I  reached Medina. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a bridegroom,&#8221; and  requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the  people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I  informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had  married a matron. He said, &#8220;Why hadn&#8217;t you married a virgin who would have played  with you, and you would have played with her?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My  father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that  I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them.  So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them and teach them manners.&#8221; When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning and he gave me  its price and gave me the camel itself as well. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me,  Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad somewhere saying, &#8216;Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh. There you  will find a lady with a letter. Take the letter from her.&#8217; &#8221; So, we set out and our  horses ran at full pace till we got at Ar-Rawda where we found the lady and said (to her).  &#8220;Take out the letter.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Either you take out the letter or else we will take off your clothes.&#8221;  So, she took it out of her braid. We brought the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  contained a statement from Hatib bin Abi Balta a to some of the Meccan pagans informing  them of some of the intentions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Don&#8217;t hasten to give  your judgment about me. I was a man closely connected with the Quraish, but I did not  belong to this tribe, while the other emigrants with you, had their relatives in Mecca who  would protect their dependents and property . So, I wanted to recompense for my lacking  blood relation to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my dependents. I  did this neither because of disbelief not apostasy nor out of preferring Kufr (disbelief)  to Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle, said, &#8220;Hatib has told you the truth.&#8221; Umar  said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Hatib participated in the battle of Badr, and who knows, perhaps Allah  has already looked at the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day (of the battle) of Badr, prisoners of  war were brought including Al-Abbas who was undressed. The Prophet looked for a shirt for  him. It was found that the shirt of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai would do, so the Prophet let him  wear it. That was the reason why the Prophet took off and gave his own shirt to &#8216;Abdullah.  (The narrator adds, &#8220;He had done the Prophet some favor for which the Prophet liked  to reward him.&#8221;) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Where is  &#8216;Ali?&#8221; He was told that &#8216;Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to  his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The  Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Should I fight them till they become like us  (i.e. Muslim)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go to them patiently and calmly till you  enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them,  for, by Allah, if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than  possessing red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

Then they  killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after they were  Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their  pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet  cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey  were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina).

So, I proceeded with one hundred and fifty cavalry men from  the tribe of Ahmas, who were excellent knights. It happened that I could not sit firm on  horses, so the Prophet , stroke me over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over my  chest, he said, &#8216;O Allah! Make him firm and make him a guiding and rightly guided man.&#8217;  &#8221; Jarir proceeded towards that house, and dismantled and burnt it.

I, too, went out along with them,  pretending to look for it. They found the donkey and entered their fort. And I, too,  entered along with them. They closed the gate of the fort at night, and kept its keys in a  small window where I could see them. When those people slept, I took the keys and opened  the gate of the fort and came upon Abu Rafi and said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi. When he replied me, I  proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He shouted and I came out to come back,  pretending to be a helper. I said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi, changing the tone of my voice. He asked  me, &#8216;What do you want; woe to your mother?&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What has happened to you?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know who came to me and hit me.&#8217; Then I drove my sword into his belly and  pushed it forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with puzzlement and  went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down but I fell down and sprained my foot.  I came to my companions and said, &#8216;I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.&#8217;  So, I did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi, the merchant pf Hijaz. Then  I got up, feeling no ailment, (and we proceeded) till we came upon the Prophet and  informed him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not screen himself from me since my  embracing Islam, and whenever he saw me he would receive me with a smile.

Make him firm and make him a guiding and a rightly-guided man.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair as the commander  of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He  instructed them, &#8220;Stick to your place, and don&#8217;t leave it even if you see birds  snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and  made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you.&#8221; Then  the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes  revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair  said, &#8220;The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what  are you waiting for now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;Have you forgotten what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;By Allah! We will go to the people  (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.&#8221; But when they went to  them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle in their rear  was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred  seventy men from us. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his  companions had caused the &#8216;Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and  seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, &#8220;Is Muhammad present amongst these  people?&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?&#8221; He asked again thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?&#8221; He then returned to his  companions and said, &#8220;As for these (men), they have been killed.&#8221; &#8216;Umar could  not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), &#8220;You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of  Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy  is still there.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;Our victory today is a counterbalance to  yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in  turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I  did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed&#8221; After that he  started reciting cheerfully, &#8220;O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle  What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime.&#8221;  (Then) Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza.&#8221; The  Prophet said (to his companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Says Allah is our Helper  and you have no helper.&#8221; </font></p>

Once the people of Medina got frightened having heard an  uproar at night.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the  mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me. I said to him,  &#8220;Woe to you! What brought you here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The she-camels of the  Prophet have been taken away.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Who took them?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Ghatafan and Fazara.&#8221; So, I sent three cries, &#8220;O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah  !&#8221; so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains hear  me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing  arrows at them saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8221;; and today perish the mean  people!&#8221; So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could  drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so  send some people to chase them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, you have  gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being  entertained by their folk.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith was holding the  reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he dismounted and started saying, &#8216;I  am the Prophet, and there is no lie about it; I am the son of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8217; On that  day nobody was seen braver than the Prophet </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 281: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the  leadership of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin Umar Al-Khattab.  They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between &#8216;Usfan, and Mecca, and their news  reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who  were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had  eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, &#8220;These are the dates  of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), &#8220;and continued following their tracks When &#8216;Asim and his  companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them.  The infidels said to them, &#8220;Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you  that we will not kill any one of you&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya  said, &#8220;By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O  Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they  martyred &#8216;Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise  and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when  the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the  third (of the captives) said, &#8220;This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go  with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.&#8221; So,  they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed  him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and  all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith  bin &#8216;Amir bin Naufal bin &#8216;Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amir on  the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Iyyad said that the  daughter of Al-Harith had told him, &#8220;When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he  borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of  mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and  the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my  face and said, &#8216;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.&#8217; By Allah, I  never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of  grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in  Mecca.&#8221; The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, &#8220;It was a boon Allah bestowed  upon Khubaib.&#8221; When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside  its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed  him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I been afraid that you would  think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah,  kill them all with no exception.&#8221; (He then recited the poetic verse):&#8211; &#8220;I being  martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause, For my killing is for  Allah&#8217;s Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body&#8221;  Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any  Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer (before being  killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he  was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to  them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed,  they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be  recognized. (That was because) &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the  battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over  Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from  his flesh. </font></p>

Ibn Saiyad  was lying in his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn  Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the  date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf!&#8221; (And this was his name). Ibn  Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman let him to himself, he would have  revealed the reality of his case.&#8221; Then the Prophet got up amongst the people,  glorifying Allah as He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, &#8220;I warn you about  him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and  Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed his  nation of.

Where will you stay tomorrow?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has Aqil left for us any  house?&#8221; He then added, &#8220;Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e.  Al-Muhassab, where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal to  heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against Bani Hashim on the terms  that they would not deal with the members of the is tribe or give them shelter.&#8221;  (Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;Khaif means valley.&#8221;) (See Hadith No. 659, Vol. 2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aslam: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called  Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or  other specified animals). He said to him, &#8220;O Hunai! Don&#8217;t oppress the Muslims and  ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is  responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few  sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  bin &#8216;Auf and the livestock of (&#8216;Uthman) bin &#8216;Affan, for if their livestock should perish,  then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own  a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and  appeal for help saying, &#8216;O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!&#8217; Would I then  neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass  rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims&#8217; treasury). By Allah, these  people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the  pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in  their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my  custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Allah&#8217;s Cause, I would not have turned  even a span of their land into a Hima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (to us), &#8221; List the names of those  people who have announced that they are Muslims.&#8221; So, we listed one thousand and five  hundred men. Then we wondered, &#8220;Should we be afraid (of infidels) although we are one  thousand and five hundred in number?&#8221; No doubt, we witnessed ourselves being  afflicted with such bad trials that one would have to offer the prayer alone in fear. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and  he remarked about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, &#8220;This (man) is from the  people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man fought violently till he  got wounded. Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man whom you described as being  from the people of the (Hell) Fire fought violently today and died.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;He will go to the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; Some people were on the point of doubting  (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this state, suddenly someone  said that he was still alive but severely wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and  committed suicide. The Prophet was informed of that, and he said, &#8220;Allah is Greater!  I testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8221; Then he ordered Bilal to announce  amongst the people: &#8216;None will enter Paradise but a Muslim, and Allah may support this  religion (i.e. Islam) even with a disobedient man.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usiya and Bani  Lihyan came to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they requested  him to support them with some men to fight their own people. The Prophet supported them  with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of  piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the  (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi&#8217;r-Ma&#8217;ana where they betrayed and  martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan  for one month in the prayer. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qatada: Anas told us that they (i.e. Muslims) used  to recite a Quranic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi said, &#8220;We were in the company of  the Prophet at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and  sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They hurried and put the  cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset  and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one  camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few  horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah&#8217;s  Permission). On that the Prophet said, &#8216;Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so,  if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.&#8221; My grandfather asked (the  Prophet ), &#8220;We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have  no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied,  &#8220;If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if  Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won&#8217;t  use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering  with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the  Ethiopians.&#8221; </font></p>

So I proceeded with  one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the  Prophet that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand  and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, &#8216;O Allah! Make him firm and a  guiding and rightly-guided man.&#8221; Jarir set out towards that place, dismantled and  burnt it, and then sent the good news to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did  not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel  (covered with tar).&#8221; So the Prophet invokes Allah to Bless the horses of the men of  Ahmas five times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman  said to Abu Talha who was one of the supporters of Ali, &#8220;I perfectly know what  encouraged your leader (i.e. &#8216;Ali) to shed blood. I heard him saying: Once the Prophet  sent me and Az-Zubair saying, &#8216;Proceed to such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will  find a lady whom Hatib has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested  the lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, &#8216;Hatib has not given me any letter.&#8217; We  said to her. &#8216;Take out the letter or else we will strip off your clothes.&#8217; So she took it  out of her braid. So the Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t hurry in  judging me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to Islam is  increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that there is none of your companions  but has relatives in Mecca who look after their families and property, while I have nobody  there, so I wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family and  property).&#8217; The Prophet believed him. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Allow me to chop off his (i.e. Hatib&#8217;s)  neck as he has done hypocrisy.&#8217; The Prophet said, (to &#8216;Umar), &#8216;Who knows, perhaps Allah  has looked at the warriors of Badr and said (to them), &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman added, &#8220;So this is what encouraged him (i.e.  Ali).&#8221; </font></p>

During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the Prophet and (his) wife fell down.  Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel  quickly) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get  hurt?&#8221; The Prophet replied,&#8221;No, but take care of the lady.&#8221; Abu Talha  covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his  garment, and she got up. He then set right the condition of their she-camel and both of  them (i.e. the Prophet and his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina. The  Prophet said, &#8220;We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising our  Lord.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying this statement till he entered Medina. </font></p>

When he reached  Sirar, he ordered that a cow be slaughtered and they ate its meat. When he arrived at  Medina, he ordered me to go to the Mosque and offer two Rakat, and weighed (and gave) me  the price of the camel.&#8221; </font></p>

		<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khilafah has Arrived. . . !!!</strong>[1] &#8211; By Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool<br>
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool wrote:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">‘My Noble Muslim brother, do not let yourself be deceived by the statement ‘<strong>Khilafah Rashida</strong>’ (Guided Caliphate), and the claim to having established the ‘Khilafah Rashida’!!</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;"><strong>Can the shadow be straight if the twig is bent!?</strong></p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;"><strong>Can guidance, and the truth, and establishing the Deen be reached by way of warring against the Deen and opposing it!?</strong></p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Have you ever asked yourself: the ‘Khilafah Rashida’ has been absent for hundreds of years and there has not been from the Muslim scholars who have called and claimed to establishing a state and then these scholars going on to  rebelling against the established authority of the leaders in command at that time?</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Will the Ummah of Islaam gather together upon misguidance?</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Can you imagine: that if this matter was true that the Muslims or the scholars did not know about ‘Khilafah Rashida’ (Guided Caliphate), and these people know about it at this time?</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Will the ‘Khilafah Rashida’ become a reality by rebelling against the leaders in authority, and invalidating the contract which is between them and their people while we have the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying, as what is brought from Ibn Abbas <em>-Radhi Allaahu anhumma</em>:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">مَنْ رَأَى مِنْ أَمِيرِهِ شَيْئًا يَكْرَهُهُ فَلْيَصْبِرْ عَلَيْهِ فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ فَارَقَ الْجَمَاعَةَ شِبْرًا فَمَاتَ إِلَّا مَاتَ مِيتَةً جَاهِلِيَّةً.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">From the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>who said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘Whoever sees from his leader something which he dislikes then he should be patient upon that, indeed whoever separates  himself from the Jammah (the collective Muslim Ummah) a hand span and dies then he dies the death of ignorance.’</span></p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari in ‘Kitab al-Fitn’, chapter the saying of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘you will see. ..’ Hadeeth no. 7054 &amp; by Muslim in ‘Kitab al-Imaraah, chapter the obligation of adhering to the Jammah of the Muslims when Fitn appear, Hadeeth no. 1848.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">From Nafa’ who said: Abdullaah bin Umar came to Abdullaah bin Muteea’ when he was in command of a place called al Hurra at the time of Yazeed bin Muwaweeya and said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">اطْرَحُوا لِأَبِي عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ وِسَادَةً!</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">‘Throw a pillow for Abu Abdurahman to recline upon.’</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Umar said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">إِنِّي لَمْ آتِكَ لِأَجْلِسَ أَتَيْتُكَ لِأُحَدِّثَكَ حَدِيثًا سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- يَقُولُهُ،<br>
سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- يَقُولُ:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">He answered:  ‘I did not come to you to sit with you. I came to you to narrate a hadeeth which I heard the Messenger of Allaah saying, I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">مَنْ خَلَعَ يَدًا مِنْ طَاعَةٍ لَقِيَ اللَّهَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا حُجَّةَ لَهُ وَمَنْ مَاتَ وَلَيْسَ فِي عُنُقِهِ بَيْعَةٌ مَاتَ مِيتَةً جَاهِلِيَّةً.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘Whoever casts off his hand from obedience then he meets Allaah on the day of judgement without any justification and whoever dies and he does not have allegiance upon his shoulders dies the death of ignorance.’</span></p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim in ‘Kitab al-Imaraah’, chapter the obligation of adhering to the Jammah of the Muslims when Fitn appear. Hadeeth no.1851.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Will the ‘Khilafah Rashida’ be established upon making the sacred blood of the innocent to be spilt, so that the people of Islaam are killed, and the people of Shirk and worshippers of idols are served. The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said as is brought from Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">(إِنَّ مِنْ وَرَطَاتِ الْأُمُورِ الَّتِي لَا مَخْرَجَ لِمَنْ أَوْقَعَ نَفْسَهُ فِيهَا سَفْكَ الدَّمِ الْحَرَامِ بِغَيْرِ حِلِّهِ)<br>
‘<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed from the critical problematic matters from which there is no exit for the one who immerses himself into them, is spilling unlawful blood without it being allowed. ‘</span></p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari in ‘Kitab ad-Deeyaat’, Chapter the saying of Allaah &lt;&lt;whoever kills a believer intentionally&gt;&gt;  Hadeeth no. 6866.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">From Abdullaah who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">(لَا يَحِلُّ دَمُ امْرِئٍ مُسْلِمٍ يَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَّا بِإِحْدَى ثَلَاثٍ: الثَّيِّبُ الزَّانِي وَالنَّفْسُ بِالنَّفْسِ وَالتَّارِكُ لِدِينِهِ الْمُفَارِقُ لِلْجَمَاعَةِ).</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The blood of a Muslim may not be legally spilt[2] other than in one of three [instances]: the married person who commits adultery; a life for a life; and one who forsakes his religion and abandons the Jammah.’</span></p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari in ‘Kitab ad-Deeyaat’, Chapter the saying of Allaah &lt;&lt;a life for a life&gt;&gt;  Hadeeth no. 6878 and by Muslim in ‘Kitab al-Qasama wal Muharibeen wal Qassas wa Deeyat, Hadeeth no. 1676.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Do you not know my noble Muslim brother that by you carrying out this opposition you are aiding the enemies of Allaah – the Magnificent &amp; the Most High-  in their plans and strategies in busying the people of Islaam and cause them to become weak, and cause them to overpower each other,  so that they do not develop or bring to reality the glory which they were once upon!?</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Will the forth coming ‘Khilafah Rashida’ be upon the hands of those who have enmity to the Sunnah and its people, they do not regard the ties with the people of the Sunnah, either of kinship or of covenant with them!?</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Will the establishment of the Deen be a reality at the hands of one who is ignorant of the Deen and does not know the Deen.  Wisdom says: ‘a lost thing cannot be given?’</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Be careful do not become entangled and then become regretful,  when regret will be of no benefit!</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Know with certainty that the ‘Khilafah Rashida’ is coming however its path is by returning to the Deen, and by following what the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and his Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radhi Allaahu anhumm</em><em>&#8211; </em>were upon.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">The way to Change the situation is by changing what is with oneself,  Allaah – the Magnificent &amp; the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">﴿إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوءًا فَلَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِهِ مِنْ وَالٍ﴾</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Allaah will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah). But when Allaah wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.</span> &gt;&gt; [Ra&#8217;ad: 11]</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Allaah has promised to grant authority on the earth, with strength and security for whoever worshipped Him alone and did not associate anything with Him,  and did righteous actions, Allaah – the Magnificent &amp; the Most High-  said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">‏﴿وَعَدَ اللَّـهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِي ارْ‌تَضَىٰ لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُم مِّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْنًا ۚ يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا يُشْرِ‌كُونَ بِي شَيْئًا ۚ وَمَن كَفَرَ‌ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ﴾</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Allaah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islaam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the <em>Fâsiqoon</em> (rebellious, disobedient to Allaah)</span>.&gt;&gt; [Noor: 55]</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">So we must bring this in to reality of we want the ‘Khilafah Rashida’, Allaah is the Guardian to give success.’</p>

<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih ‘Ala Shaykh said:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">‘Here is an issue connected to this hadeeth: if there is a country where there is no leader or Muslim ruler who can carry out that verdict, then is it allowed for any Muslim to carry out its ruling if one of these verdicts are established?</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">The answer: No, as is the saying of the general people of knowledge.  They make the condition for carrying out rulings which are connected to the allowance of spilling blood, wealth and honour, or things similar to this, that it is only for the leader, and if there is no leader then it is not allowed for anyone to carry it out.’</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">‘That he is in a country where there is no-one who can carry out the rulings of Allaah –Jala wa ‘Uulaa – then it is not allowed to carry out the rulings of capital punishment, because this is for the Muslim leader.</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was in Makkah and the Companions were in some countries where the Sharia’ was not established,  however, they did not carry out capital punishment, likewise the scholars were in some countries, like they were in the lands of the al-Ubaydeeyah and those similar to them, and the scholars did not carry out punishments of death and those type of punishments similar to it.’</p>
<p style="color:#4b5d67;text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Sharh al-Arbaeen an-Nawawi’ &#8211; Shaykh Salih ‘Ala Shaykh]</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Ok, there is another question about our brothers in Bosnia …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: I heard that you said to some brothers who had wanted to go there to fight in the cause of Allāh with their lives: fight against yourselves (i.e. purify yourselves)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Yes, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: This means that you don&#8217;t advise (people) to go there (for jihād)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Well don&#8217;t you think that people there are in need of help?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: How can I not think so? Yet is help achieved by putting more lives of Muslims to death in  vain? Where is the preparation with which we have been commanded in the Noble Qur’ān?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: What if there is a benefit?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: If you believe that there is a benefit, then it (jihād) is compulsory. Do you believe so?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: On what basis?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: There are weak Muslims&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Please brother, don’t tell me about the status quo; tell me what the benefit is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: The benefit is helping them and (unclear speech) …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: May Allāh guide you! Helping them requires (the intervention) of the States not individuals. The situation needs organized army that are trained in using weapons. It needs tanks, aircrafts, etc. What individual means are you talking about? If we sent one thousand people from here and there, they would be easy targets of (the enemy) fire. What could these people do in the face of the tanks and destructive weapons (of the enemy)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: Glory be to Allāh! I am surprised at how the youth do not look at these issues except in a very limited way. I asked you if there were a benefit. You said, “Yes.” What is this benefit? They are weak! May Allah guide you, Abu Suhaib! As if I did not know that they are weak and that they are few in number and under-armed compared to the Serbs first and their allies second and particularly the Americans who have destroyed everything. Don&#8217;t you know these facts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: How can you say that there is a benefit? Is there a benefit in destroying Muslims in vain and that&#8217;s exactly what happened in Afghanistan? Do you think that jihād in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be any stronger than in Afghanistan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: What was the result there? Uh? The result was that we reaped bitter melon (i.e. we suffered defeat) &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: … and we brought destruction upon ourselves because we opposed the religious teachings in many, many details, the most apparent of which, as the bad end results showed, was (differing and split). (Allāh says): ﴿</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And be you not of Al-Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the oneness of Allah). Of those who split up their religion and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it.</span> (30: 31-32)</p>
<p>Seven parties fighting against one party and that is the Communist party. The Communist party, which is a kafir party, vs three Muslim parties. How could this happen? Therefore, don&#8217;t forget, even though you live far away from us, the principle that the beginning should be with tasfia wat-tarbia (i.e. purification and education) …</p>
<p><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: … and then remember the saying of Allāh (Azzawa Jal):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-42-30.png"><img class="alignnone" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-42-30.png?w=650&h=55" alt="" width="650" height="55"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.</span>(42:30)</p>
<p>And we ask Allāh (Azzawa Jal) to grant victory to our Muslims brother in all Muslim land.<br>
Yes unfortunately as our Lord says in the Nobel Qur’ān:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-33-62.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-33-62.png?w=555&h=47" alt="" width="555" height="47"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">That was the Way of Allāh in the case of those who passed away of old, and you will not find any change in the Way of Allāh.</span> (33:62)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-35-43.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-35-43.png?w=644&h=100" alt="" width="644" height="100"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And no turning off will you find in the Sunnah of Allāh</span>. (35:43)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-13-11.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-13-11.png?w=734&h=114" alt="" width="734" height="114"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allāh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves. But when Allāh wills a people&#8217;s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Allāh no protector.</span> (13:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if we want to defend a nation from among the Islamic nations we must first and foremost defend Islam in our very home countries. Yet we don&#8217;t defend Islam in our countries and that&#8217;s why we have been inflicted by calamities in our home countries, and this is something we feel sorry about and we ask Allāh (Azzawa Jal) to grant Muslims His True Promise:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-40-51.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-40-51.png?w=756&h=64" alt="" width="756" height="64"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe (in the Oneness of Allāh Islāmic Monotheism) in this world&#8217;s life ..</span>. (40:51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There will not cease to be a group of my Ummah, victorious upon truth and not harmed by those who oppose them until the Hour is established.” Maybe this is enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner</strong>: May Allāh reward you with good, shaykh.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albāny</strong>: The same to you, by Allāh&#8217;s will. Let me hear your voice soon.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8220;Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd fî Hadyi Khayri-l &#8216;Ibâd&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Prophet&#8217;s <i>Ghazwat</i>, <i> Bu&#8217;uth</i> and <i>Saraya</i> [1] occurred after the <i>Hijrah</i>, within a span of ten years. There were either twenty-seven <i>Ghazwat</i>, or twenty-five, or twenty-nine. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> had to fight in nine battles, <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraidhah</i>, <i>al-Mustaliqh</i>, <i> Khaybar</i>,<i> al-Fath&#8217;</i> (Conquering of Makkah), <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tâ&#8217;if</i>. It was said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also fought against <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i> (a Jewish tribe) and at <i>al-Ghabah</i> and <i>Wadi al-Qura</i>, which was a suburb of Khaybar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>Saraya</i> of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and the armies he sent, they numbered close to sixty. There were seven major battles: <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-</i><i>Khandaqh</i>, <i>Khaybar</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tabuk</i>. [2] Several parts of the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned these major <i>Ghazwat</i>. For instance, Sûrah al-Anfâl (chapter 8) was revealed about <i>Ghazwat Badr</i>, while the last part of Sûrah ali-&#8216;Imrân (chapter 3) was about <i>Ghazwat &#8216;Uhud</i>, from Allâh&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (remember) when you [Muhammad <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i></b><b>] left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle&#8221;</b> [3:121],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until just before the end of the Sûrah. The beginning of Sûrah al-Ahzâb (chapter 33) was revealed about the battles of <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraydhah</i> and <i>Khaybar</i>. Sûrah al-&#8216;Hashr (59) was revealed about <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i> (48) about <i>al-&#8216;Hudaibiyyah</i> and the battle of <i>Khaybar</i>. The conquering of Makkah was mentioned indirectly in Sûrah al-Fath&#8217; and directly in Sûrah an-Nasr (110). He <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was wounded during the battle of <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>. [3] The angels fought alongside the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> during the battles of <i>Badr</i> [4] and <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i>. They also descended during the battle of <i>al-Khandaqh</i> [5], where they shook the <i>Mushriks</i> [surrounding <i>Madînah</i>] and defeated them. During that battle, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> threw a handful of sand at the faces of the <i>Mushriks</i> (Polytheists) and they fled [without a fight]. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> won decisively in two battles, <i>Badr</i> and <i>&#8216;Hunain</i>. He used <i>al-Manjaniq</i> (mongonel, or catapult) during on battle, <i>at-Tâ&#8217;if</i>, and took cover behind a trench during <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaqh</i>, also known as <i>Ghazwat al-Ahzâb</i>. Salmân al-Farsî <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> suggested that the trench be dug in that battle.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, pl. for &#8216;<i>Ghazwah</i>&#8216;, means battles. The battles that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led himself were called, &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, whereas the armies and expeditions he sent while remaining behind are called, &#8216;<i>Bu&#8217;uth</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Ba&#8217;th</i>&#8216;, and &#8216;<i>Saraya</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Sariyyah</i>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] All of which are mentioned in detail later on in, <i>Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Al-Bukhârî (3767) narrated that Sahl bin as-Sa&#8217;idi was asked about how the wound of the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was treated, and he replied, &#8220;&#8216;Alî used to bring water in his shield and Fâtimah (the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and &#8216;Alî&#8217;s wife) used to wash the blood off his face. Then straw mat was burnt and the wound was filled with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Al-Bukhârî (3694) narrated that &#8216;Abdullâh ibn &#8216;Abbâs <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said on the day of <i>Badr</i>, &#8220;Here is Jibrîl, holding the head of his horse and wearing war armours.&#8221; Allâh sent the angels to strengthen their hearts of the believers and to aid them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Shaykh &#8216;Irfân said, &#8220;Allâh said in Sûrah al-Ahzâb (33:9), <b> &#8216;O you who believe! Remember Allâh&#8217;s Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [angels during the battle of Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates, <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaq</i> (in 5 AH)]. And Allâh is Ever All-Seer of what you do.&#8217; </b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Al-Bukhârî (2716) and Muslim (3277) narrated that Allâh&#8217;s Apostle <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked for Allâh&#8217;s wrath upon the <i> Ahzâb</i>, saying: <i>&#8220;O, Allâh, Revealer of the Holy Book, and the One swift at reckoning! O, Allâh, Defeat the confederates. O, Allâh, Defeat them and shake them.&#8221;</i></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam ash-Shanqiti [1] , Adwaa&#8217;ul-Bayaan (10/21-23)<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not say about those who are killed fighting in the Path of Allaah that they are dead. Rather, they are alive!&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is an apparent proof that the martyrs [those who are killed in the Path of Allaah] are not dead. Yet in another verse Allaah says, whilst addressing the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; who is better than any and every martyr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed you will die, and they will die.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this [apparent contradiction] is: That the martyrs are dead from a worldly point of view, this is why they can be inherited from, and why their wives can remarry again &#8211; a point about which the Scholars have ijmaa&#8217; (consensus) upon. It is this death, the worldly death, that Allaah informed would occur to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. This is why Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said, when the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam passed away: &#8220;May my mother and father be sacrificed for you O Prophet of Allaah! By Allaah! Allaah will never combine two deaths for you. You have died the death that Allaah decreed for you &#8230; Whosoever worships Muhammad, let him know that Muhammad is dead.&#8221; Then he deduced this by reciting the [above] verse, and the Companions of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted this.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the life that Allaah affirmed in the Qur&#8217;aan for the martyrs, and the life that has been affirmed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam in which he is able to return the greetings of salaam to whosoever sends it upon him, then both of them refer to the life of the barzakh (a state of existence between the present life and the Hereafter); an existence which cannot be truly comprehended by the people of this world. So with regards to the martyrs there is a reference to this in Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154]. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained this verse by saying: <i>&#8220;Their souls ore in the bellies of green birds, which hove lanterns suspended for them from Allaah&#8217;s Throne. They roam around in Paradise wherever they desire, then return to these lanterns &#8230;&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for [the life affirmed for] the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then he said: &#8220;There is no one who sends the greetings of salaam upon me, except that Allaah returns my soul hock until I reply to their greeting.&#8221;4 And: &#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;5 So this life also cannot truly be comprehended by the intellects of the people of this world. Since, along with this [fact], his sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s blessed soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise with the companionship of the highest company; a company higher than the souls of the martyrs. Yet the reality of how his pure soul links itself to his noble body &#8216;alayhis-salaam &#8211; a body which the earth cannot consume &#8211; is a reality which no one knows, except Allaah alone. Thus, if this type of life was like the life that is understood by the people of this world, then why did Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu say that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was dead, and why was it permitted to bury him? [And if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not die] then why was there a need to appoint a khaleefah (succesor) after him. Also, those events; such as the [tragic] killing of &#8216;Uthmaan radiollaahu &#8216;anhu, or the differences which arose between the Companions, or that which occurred with &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa need not have happened if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive! Since if that were the case, they could have referred judgement back to him concerning those issues in which they differed [if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive and could fulfill such needs].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, just as the Qur&#8217;aan is explicitly clear that the martyrs are actually living; due to Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive.&#8221;</b> Then likewise, the Qur&#8217;aan is just as explicitly clear that this state of living is one whose reality cannot be truly understood by the people of this world; due to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;But you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> Similarly, just as it is established that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is living in the grave; replying to the greetings of salaam, yet even though his Companions actually buried him, they were still unable to perceive this state of living. Thus, we know that this state of living is likewise a reality which cannot be truly understood by the people of this world. However, what could make this more clear is by considering the example of someone who is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">asleep. The state of one who is asleep differs from that of one who is awake in many ways, including the fact that the one who sleeps experiences dreams which can be understood. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;It is known by necessity that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s body is intact and has not decayed. The Companions asked him: How are we to send greetings of salaam upon you when your body has decayed! So he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi we sallam replied: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets.&#8221; </i>So if his body was not in his grave, then why would he respond to this question! And it has been authentically established from him that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;</i>7 It is authentic from him that he once came with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar [into the mosque] and said: &#8220;We shall be raised up like this on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;8 It is also established that he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw the Prophet Moosaa praying in his grave on the night of his Israa (Heavenly Ascension), and he also saw him [on that same night] in the sixth or seventh Heaven.9 So the soul is in one place and is connected to the body, which resides in the grave. Similarly, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is in his grave; replying to the greetings of salaam sent to him, along with the fact that his soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise along with the highest companionship. So there is no contradiction between these two matters; since the affairs of the souls is one thing, whilst that of the bodies is another.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in these words is a proof that the life of the barzakh, that was previously mentioned, is a life whose reality is not known to the people of this world. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> And complete and perfect knowledge is only with Allaah.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh bin Baz , Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&#8217;ah (3/438-446)<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q1]: What, in your opinion, is the definition of al-ghazwa al-fikree (the ideological attack)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A1]: Ideological warfare is a modern term which refers to a set of efforts in which a nation engages in order to conquer or influence another nation, so that [the attacked nation] takes a particular course of direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is far more serious than military warfare, since it aims at secrecy, seeking to achieve subtle objectives initially; so that the attacked nation does not perceive it, nor prepare to halt it, nor stand in its way &#8211; thereby falling victim to [such an attack]. The eventual result of this onslaught is that this nation becomes sick in mind and sense; loving what the enemy wants it to love and hating what they want it to hate. It is a chronic disease which attacks and destroys nations, doing away with its personality, removing such meanings as foundations and strength. The nation which is struck by this [ideological attack] does not even feel what has hit it, or what it even is! That is why curing it becomes somewhat difficult, and making [the attacked nation] understand the ways of righteousness becomes a struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This war takes place by means of school curriculums, general education, media, small and large size publications, and other such channels [that influence the thoughts of its people]. Through this the enemy hopes to deviate the nation from its beliefs; becoming attached to what the enemy throws at it. We ask Allaah for safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q2]: Are the Arabs generally subject to this type of warfare, in particular the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A2]: Yes, the Muslims in general, including the Arabs, the Kingdom, and other than them, are all subject to a great ideological warfare from the nations of kufr (unbelief); from both the east and the west. The severest and most serious of these [ideological] onslaughts is:- [1] <b>The war of the christian crusaders.</b> [2] <b>The zionist war.</b> [3] <b>The communist and atheistic war.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE CHRISTIAN CRUSADERS]</b> The war of the christian crusaders is today at its most intense. Since Salaahud-Deen al-Ayyoobee achieved victory over the christians crusading in the Muslim lands with their strength and weapons, the christians realised that even though they had achieved [some] victories, these victories</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">were temporary ones that did not last. That is why they started thinking about the most destructive alternatives. After numerous case studies and assemblies they arrived at [something] that was far more dangerous and destructive than military warfare; which was that the christian nations, both individually and collectively, should launch an ideological attack on those Muslims who were just beginning to grow and develop. This is because conquering the hearts and thoughts [of people] is far more permanent than conquering their lands! The Muslim whose mind has not been corrupted cannot bear to see the unbelievers wielding authority, and ordering and prohibiting in his own country. Therefore such a Muslim strives his utmost to expel and distance them &#8211; even if he has to sacrifice his own life, or or his most cherished possession, for this cause. And this is what happened after the major conquest of the crusaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muslim who is exposed to the [effects] of this filthy war, he becomes ill in thought and desensitised to this disease. He does not see any danger with the presence of christians in the lands of the Muslims. Indeed, he may even think that their presence is a source of goodness which aids and advances civilisation. So the christians have sufficed themselves with this ideological warfare, as opposed to the military one, because it is more effective and more permanent. What need do they have of deploying troops or spending huge sums of money, when there exists amongst the children of the Muslims those who can actually fulfill their wishes &#8211; intentionally or unintentionally, with a price or without one! This is why they do not resort to openly fighting the Muslims with weapons and arms, except in rare cases when necessity dictates this. They resort to this in situations where speed is sought; such as what happened in Uganda and Pakistan; or when there is a need to stabilise the advancement, or establish centres, or to establish bases which engage in destructive ideological warfare; such as what happened in Egypt, Syria, Iraaq, and other countries, before their expulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE ZIONIST JEWS]</b> The zionist war is just the same. The jews strive their utmost to corrupt the beliefs, morals and manners of the Muslims. The jews scheme and crave after possessing the Muslim lands, as well as the lands of others. They have fulfilled some of their plans and continue striving hard to implement the rest of them. Even though they they do engage the Muslims in warfare involving strength and arms and have occupied some of their lands, they also fight them through spreading</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and aiding the spread of] destructive thoughts, beliefs and ideologies; such as Freemasonry, Qadiaanisim, Bahaaism, Teejaanism, and others &#8211; seeking the support of the christians, and others, in order to fulfill their objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>THE COMMUNISTS AND ATHEISTS</strong>] As for the communist/atheist war, then presently it is spreading like wildfire across the Muslim lands.2 This happens as a consequence of their being an emptiness [with regards beliefs], weak eemaan (certainty of faith) in most people, wide spread ignorance, and the lack of a correct and healthy [Islaamic] cultivation and development. The communist parties from Russia and China, as well as others, have managed to ensnare [into this false ideology] every spiteful, malicious person; driven by those weak in faith, or having no faith at all! They selected these types of people as being their puppets and plants in that country; spreading through [such puppets] their filthy atheistic and communistic ideologies. They lured them with promises of high positions of power and status. Through them they tore apart the Muslim Ummah and they were made [to act as] the troops of Shaytaan. They were aided in this by the christians and the jews, who sometimes assisted in their preparation, whilst at other times they aided and supported them. Thus, even though they do have differences between them, yet they become a single hand against the Muslims. They view the Muslims as their worst enemy, that is why we see them co-operating with each other, as allies, against the Muslims. And Allaah&#8217;s aid is sought, and He suffices us and is the best of guardians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q3]: What are the means which the west uses in order to spread their ideas and thoughts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A3]: The means that the west employs in order to spread their thoughts and ideas are many, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The attempt to conquer the minds of the Muslim children. They do this by infusing in them western values and concepts so that they then believe that the best way to adopt in any matter is that of the west &#8211; whether it is with regards to what religion or sect they believe, or with regards to the languages that they speak, or the manners, customs and values with which they clothe themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Custody of a large group of the children of the Muslims in every country, concern for them and bringing them up, so that when they absorb western thoughts, they return to their countries with a halo of praise and compliment, until they acquire position and authority in their countries by which they circulate western ideologies and establish learning centres conforming to western curricula or are directly influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Their active drive towards promoting the learning of western languages in the Muslim lands, making them compete with the Muslims&#8217; languages, especially the Arabic language, which is language of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; by which this Book was sent and by which the Muslims worship their Lord;in their Salaah (Prayer), their rites of Hajj (Pilgrimage), their forms of remembrances and glorifications, etc. From this is the encouragement of destructive propaganda that fights against [the usage and learning] of [pure and classical] Arabic Language and attempt to weaken the conformity to it in the Muslim lands. They do this by calling to using colloquialism, and by arranging numerous studies that intend to &#8216;develop&#8217; grammar in order to corrupt it; as well as formalising folk literature and and matters of national heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Development of western universities and missionary schools in Muslim countries and also initiating the role of kindergarten and playschools, hospitals and clinics which they make as dens and nests for their evil aims. They encourage the higher classes to study in them (western and missionary schools and universities) and after them help in acquire leadership posts and great position until they become an aid for their masters in following their plots in the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: The attempt to control education curricula in Muslim lands and drawing out their politics, either directly; as occurred in some Muslim countries when the priest Dunlop undertook that task there, or by indirect methods. When the task was undertaken, most of the successful students who studied in Dunlop&#8217;s schools and graduated in them, arose as a destructive pickaxe in their country, or as one of the enemies most lethal weapons. [Such students] strive hard to influence the educational curriculum and steer it towards secularism &#8211; an ideology which does not centre around having eemaan (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger; but rather steers in the direction of atheism, or towards immorality and corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: The large number of individuals amongst the jews and christians who have undertaken the study of Islam, Arabic Language, compiling books, and taking positions of teaching in universities; until they created an ideological turmoil and confusion amongst the educated Muslims, which they hurl at those that they are teaching, or with which they fill their books &#8211; until some of those books became sources which writers and researchers refer to in matters of ideology or history. Many people who were responsible for creating some of these fitnahs (trials and turmoil) in the Muslim countries, were actually Muslims who graduated at the hands of the people. The praise and awe which surrounded such graduates helped them to achieve this, as well as achieve their post and positions; such as important posts in teaching and leadership. So they completed what their teachers had initiated [of corruption and destruction] and fulfilled what they couldn&#8217;t achieve, because they were of Muslim offspring and from the same skin, ascribing themselves to them and speaking their tongue &#8211; so we ask and seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>: A large number of missionary workers calling to christianity have proceeded between the Muslims that they have performed their work on. [This missionary activity is done upon] well studied principles, and upon a large scale; employing hundreds of thousands of men and women. Huge financial budgets are put aside for this task, and [they are aided in such a way that] their task is made easier for them and obstacles are removed for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They want to extinguish the Light (i.e, the Religion) of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will bring His Light to perfection and completion, even though the disbelievers hate it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the efforts of the missionaries are set up and aimed mostly at the common levels; then the efforts of the orientalist are directed to the educated &#8211; as I previously mentioned. The missionaries take on huge hardships in their work in the African Countries, and in the remote villages of the far extreme Muslim lands; in eastern Asia. After that, every so often, they hold conferences in order to review their accounts and their plans; then they analyse, adjust and implement. They met in Cairo in 1906, in Edinburgh in 1910, in Lucknow (India) in 1911, and in Jerusalem in 1935, and they continue to hold such assemblies, seminars and conferences &#8211; so glory be to the One in Whose Hand is the sole sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighthly</strong>: Spreading corruption in the Muslim societies; belittling the [status of women] with regards to their role in life, making her transgress the limits set by Allaah for her, creating in her a satisfaction in abstaining from the [correct] Path. They do this by spreading propaganda amongst the Muslims in various ways and manners, so that women freely mix with men, and so that women work in the places of men. By this, they aim to corrupt the Muslim society, and to put an end to the chastity and purity which is found therein. Additionally, by bringing up imaginary issues and false propaganda &#8211; [claiming] that Islaam oppresses women, and that Muslim women have very little rights &#8211; they want to take her out of her home, and put her wherever they may want; even though the limits that Allaah has set [in the Qur&#8217;aan] are clear; as are His commands [concerning these matters], and as is the Sunnah (Guidance) of His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the Believing women to draw their jilbaabs (cloaks) over their entire body. That will be better, that they should be known (as free and respectable women), so as not to be harassed, And Allaah is Ever-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And let the Believing women draw their khimaars (head-scarves) over their faces, necks and chests, and not to display their beauty, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&#8217;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&#8217;s sons &#8230;&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:31].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of jaahiliyyah (pre-lslaamic ignorance).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br>
<i>&#8220;Beware of entering into the company of women.&#8221;</i> A man from the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives! He replied: <i>&#8220;The husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives are death!&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br>
<i>&#8220;A man must not be alone in the company of a women, for indeed the third of them is shaytaan.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninthly</strong>: The Building of churches and temples in the Muslim lands and spending great amounts of wealth on them; beautifying them, making them very conspicuous and noticeable, and building them in the largest and best of places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: Radio stations set up solely for the purpose of calling to christianity and communism, spreading their [false] objectives. They intend to misguide, through such false ideas, the children of the innocent and naive Muslims &#8211; who neither understand, nor did they receive a sufficient Islaamic education. This is the case, in particular, in Africa where the Bible is published and distributed in plenty of hotels, etc. [They also] send missionary publications and false preaching to many of the Muslim children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means utilised by the enemies of Islaam today &#8211; from east and the west &#8211; in waging war against the Muslim&#8217;s thought, [intending by this ideological attack] to put an end to correct righteous thought, so that they are replaced by [false and] foreign ideas; whether eastern or western. And &#8211; O noble reader &#8211; as you can see, these means involve tremendous efforts, enormous amounts of money and a multitude of soldiers. All of this is done in order to take the Muslims away from Islaam, even if they do not actually embrace christianity, judaism or marxism. Since their primary goal in doing this is to take the Muslims away from Islaam, so that when this stage is achieved, then whatever [misguidance] follows becomes far easier to implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, despite all this we say: that Allaah will frustrate them in their hopes, and will nullify their plans &#8211; but only if the Muslims are sincere in their fight against them, cautious and alert to their plans, and obedient and upright upon their Religion; as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But if you remain patient and become pious and obedient to Allaah, their plots will not harm you in the least. Indeed, Allah encompasses all that they do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they are spreaders of corruption, Allaah Will not give total facilitation to their actions. Rather Allaah &#8211; the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They plot and plan, and Allaah plans, and indeed Allaah is the best of planners.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed they are planning a plan, but I am planning a plan, but give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Taariq 86:15-17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe! If you help Allaah [by acting upon that which He has commanded you to do], He will help you against your enemies, and make your foothold firm.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And indeed Allaah will help those who help His Cause. Truly, Allaah is Most-Powerful, Most-Mighty. Those who, if We give them power and authority in the land, establish the Salaah (Prayer), give the Zakaah, command the good and forbid the evil. And with Allaah rests the end of all affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hajj 22:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many verses carrying this same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, without a doubt, the matter requires the Muslims to have some common sense and some contemplation, some study about the course of action that should be taken, about the most suitable stance they should take, and that they should be heedful and have some awareness which will make them capable of understanding the schemes of their enemies, and active upon rendering them futile and false. This shall not be accomplished for them except by adhering to Allaah, adherence to His guidance, returning to Him, repenting to Him and seeking His aid. Additionally, by bearing in mind His guidance in everything, especially with regard to the relation of the believers with the unbelievers, and by understanding Soorah <b>&#8220;Say, O Disbelievers&#8221;</b> and what Allaah the Most High &#8211; mentions in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will the jews and the christians be pleased with you until you follow their religion and way of life.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also [what He mentions in] His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they will not stop fighting you, until they turn you back from your Religion; if they are able.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al- Baqarah 2:217]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that He grants right guidance to this Ummah, with regards to their affairs, and that He grants protection to it from the plots of its enemies, and that He grants it firmness and obedience, both in speech and action &#8211; so that there can be for them might, strength and honour; as Allaah desires for them. Indeed He is the only One Who has the power to do so. And may Allaah extol, and send the blessings of peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed Allaah will help those who help Him. Indeed Allaah is Exalted in Might, All-Powerful.&#8221; [Soorah Hajj 22:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shanqeetee (d.1393H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; explains in this noble <i>Aayah</i> that He has sworn to help and give victory to those who help Him. It is known that the help and victory of Allaah comes by following what He has prescribed, obeying His commend, avoiding His prohibitions, by helping His Messengers and their followers, aiding His Religion and fighting against His enemies and overpowering them &#8211; until the word of Allaah is made uppermost, whilst the word of His enemies is debased and mode low. Then Allaah &#8211; the Most High, the Most Magnificent &#8211; explains the charecteristics of those whom He has promised would receive His help and victory, distinguishing them from others. So He said &#8211; explaining those to whom He swore He would aid and give victory to &#8211; because He is the one to aid and give victory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which this noble <i>aayah</i> indicates is that whosoever aids Allaah, then Allaah will aid Him. This is clearly explained in other than this place, such as His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe. If you help Allaah, Allaah will help you; and establish your feet firmly. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and Allaah will make their deeds vain.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, Our Word has gone forth of old for our slaves, the Messengers, that they will certainly be victorious; and that Our forces will certainly be triumphant.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saafaat 37:171-173].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has Decreed: It is My Messenger and I who will prevail.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Mujaadalah 58:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who believe and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah in the land.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His &#8211; the Most High &#8216;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In it is a proof that there is no promise from Allaah of His help, except by establishing the Prayer, paying the Zakaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. So it is these whom Allaah will establish upon the earth and will strengthen His Word through them. However, those who do not establish the salaah, nor pay the Zakaah, nor enjoin the good nor forbid the evil, then there is no promise for them from Allaah that He will aid and grant them victory. They are not from His party, nor are they his friends -those who have the promise of His help and victory. Rather, they are the party of Shaytaan and his friends. So if they were to expect the help of Allaah and the fulfillment of His promise upon them, then their example is like that of a hired worker who refuses to do the labour that he was hired for, yet he expects to be rewarded. So whosoever is like this, then he has no intellect!&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the help that we so desperately await, and the victory that we so strongly desire will only come about by: &#8220;The Muslims returning and repenting to their Lord, correcting their &#8216;aqeedoh (beliefs) and cultivating themselves and their families upon the pure and correct Islaam; putting into effect Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will Allaah change the condition of a people, until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11].&#8221;2</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the &#8216;Islamic terror&#8217; are endless. From the times in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80&#8217;s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who&#8217;s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can&#8217;t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur&#8217;an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word &#8216;salama&#8217; which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jihad </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a &#8216;holy war&#8217;, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic&#8221; [3]. </i>In the Qur&#8217;an, Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; &#8216;Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; &#8216;Make not mischief on the Earth&#8217;, they say; &#8216;We are only peace makers&#8217;. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <i>&#8220;forbade the killing of women and children</i>&#8221; [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading such passages from the Qur&#8217;an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah&#8217;s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Those who go to extremes are destroyed&#8221; </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam&#8217;s glorious law. However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up&#8221;</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli&#8217;s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell&#8221; </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He is a dweller of the Fire&#8221;. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire&#8221; </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>&#8230;If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Media</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi&#8217;ite suicide bombers of the 80&#8217;s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi&#8217;ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, &#8216;The Today&#8217; [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>&#8220;In The Name of Islam&#8221; </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? &#8230; no. The way forward? &#8230; yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256)</p>
