										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Statement from the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ concerning the ruling on celebrating the Gregorian Year 2000 and related issues</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Last of the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioners have asked about the ruling on dedicating attention to the Gregorian millennium, celebrating it, and other issues relating to the event. It is sufficient for us to quote just two of the posed questions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first question says,</strong> “Nowadays we see the programs that the mass media is broadcasting about the celebrations and preparations held for the arrival of the Year 2000, and the beginning of the third millennium. The Kafirs (disbelievers) from among the Jews, Christians, and others, are very happy about it and pin their hopes on this event. My question, Your Eminence, is that some Muslims have become interested in it and are considering it a happy occasion to get married or do business on. Others are advertising this event in their shops or companies, and doing other things that offend Muslims. What is the Shari‘ah (Islamic law) ruling on celebrating this event and exchanging verbal congratulations and cards on it? May Allah reward you with the best for the efforts you exert for Islam and Muslims!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second question says,</strong> “The Jews and the Christians are preparing to celebrate the arrival of the Year 2000 according to their calendar, in an extraordinary way to promote their plans and beliefs in the world, particularly in Muslim countries. Some Muslims have been influenced by this propaganda and have also started preparing for it and many of them are announcing sales on this occasion. We fear that this may affect the Muslims’ ‘Aqidah (creed) in relation to their loyalties to non-Muslims. We hope you will explain the ruling on Muslims’ following the Kafir (disbelievers) in their special occasions, propagating and celebrating them, and the ruling on giving workers the day off in some organizations and companies to mark this occasion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Does doing any of these or similar things, or approving them, have any effect on a Muslim’s ‘Aqidah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Having studied the questions, the committee answered as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and the guidance to the Straight Path are the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His Servants. It is through His Mercy that Allah (Exalted be He) obligates His Believing Servants to ask Him for guidance during Salah (Prayer). They ask Him to guide them to and keep them on the Straight Path. Allah (Glorified be He) describes this Straight Path as being the path of those on whom He has bestowed His Grace from among the Prophets, the Siddiqin (the followers of the prophets who were first to believe in them, such as Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq), the martyrs, and the righteous, and not the path of those who have gone astray from the Jews, Christians, and other Kafirs (disbelievers) and Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is learned, it is obligatory on a Muslim to realize the greatness of Allah’s Blessing upon them. They should give thanks to Allah (Glorified be He) in words, deeds, and beliefs. They should guard this blessing, protect it, and adopt the means necessary to keep from loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An insightful look into Allah’s Din (Religion) in today’s world, in which the truth and falsehood have become mixed and confused for many people, will clearly see the efforts the enemies of Islam are exerting to destroy its realities, extinguish its light, distance Muslims from it, and sever all their connections with it by any possible means. Not only that, but they are also attempting to distort its image and bring accusations and forge lies against it, to avert people from the Way of Allah,and from Iman (Faith) in what Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) confirms this by saying (what means): <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 109" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ManyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 69" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ApartyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">A party of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish to lead you astray. But they shall not lead astray anyone except themselves, and they perceive not.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 149" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Ifyouobey"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 99" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Say:OpeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you stop those who have believed, from the Path of Allâh, seeking to make it seem crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses [to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as a Messenger of Allâh and Islâm (Allâh’s religion, i.e. to worship none but Him Alone)]? And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.</span>&#8220;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There as also many other Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has made a promise to protect His Religion and Book, as He says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 9" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Verily,We,itisWeWhohavesent"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’ân) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption</span>).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> All praise is to Allah! Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed that a group of his Ummah (nation based on one creed) will continue on the Truth, triumphant, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake or oppose them until the Day of Judgment. All praise is to Allah! We ask Allah (Exalted be He), Who is the Ever-Near and the Responsive, to make us and our Muslim brothers among this group. Indeed, He is the Most Generous Bestower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ has seen and heard about the huge preparations and great interest shown by the Jews, the Christians, and those so-called Muslims who are influenced by them to mark the end of the year and welcome the new millennium according to the Gregorian calendar, and the committee cannot but provide advice and clarification for all Muslims on the facts of this occasion and give the ruling of the sanctified Shari‘ah on it, so Muslims will be enlightened about their Din and beware of the deviations of those who earned Allah’s Anger and those who went astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To continue:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The Jews and the Christians have attached events, sufferings, and pinned hopes on the arrival of this millennium, which they are certain &#8211; or almost certain &#8211; that they shall come to pass, as they are the outcome of their researches and studies, as they claim. They have also attached some of their creedal issues to this millennium, which they claim to have been mentioned in their distorted books. It is obligatory on Muslims not to pay attention to this or believe it; instead they should be content with the Book of their Lord (Exalted be He) and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and any theory or opinion contrary to these is just an illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Second</span></strong>: This and other similar occasions are never devoid of mixing the truth with falsehood, and inviting to Kufr (disbelief), Dalalah (deviation from what is right), licentiousness, atheism, and the emergence of Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).Among these invitations are the calls to unify the religions, equate Islam with false creeds and sects, ask for the blessing of the Cross, and practice the Jewish and Christian rites. This is in addition to the words and deeds that either imply that the distorted abrogated Christian and Jewish creeds can lead to Allah, or express approval of some of their beliefs which contradict the Din of Islam or constitute Kufr (disbelief) in Allah, His Messenger, and Islam, by the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, this occasion is one of the means of alienating Muslims from their Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The Qur’an, Sunnah, and authentic Athar (narrations from the Companions) give detailed evidence on the prohibition of imitating the disbelievers in what is particular to them. This includes imitating them in their ‘Eids or celebrating them. ‘Eid (festival) is a generic term which (in the context of these reports) includes every day or occasion which is repeated and is venerated by the Kafirs, or any place in which the Kafirs hold religious gatherings, or any action which they do in these places or at these times &#8211; all of that is part of their ‘Eids or festivals. The prohibition applies not only to their festivals, but to any times or places which they venerate that have no basis in the Din of Islam; and all the invented acts that they do at them are prohibited also. The days preceding and following their festivals are also covered by this prohibition, as pointed out by Shaykh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) which specifically forbid imitating Non-Muslims in their festivals is Allah’s Saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Furqan, 25: 72" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Andthosewhodonotbearwitness"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And those who do not bear witness to falsehood</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> This is stated as one of the characteristics of Allah’s Believing Servants. A group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors), including: Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, and Al-Rabi‘ ibn Anas, interpreted the word &#8220;<strong>Al-Zur (falsehood)</strong>&#8221; as referring to the festivals of the Kafirs. It was authentically reported that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="WhentheMessengerofAllah(peace"></a><span id="13870"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Al-Madinah, they had two days on which they would celebrate. He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘What are these two days?’ They said, ‘We used to celebrate on these two days during the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “Allah has given you two days instead of these that are better than them: the Day of Al-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) and the Day of Al-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast)</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Al-ImamAhmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, through Sahih [authentic] Sanad [chain of narrators])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically narrated by Thabit ibn Al-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Amanvowedtosacrificesomecamels"></a><span id="10255"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">A man vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah (a hill beyond Yanbu`) during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). So, he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, ‘I have vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked, “Were there any idols of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) there that were worshipped?” They said, ‘No.’ He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘Were any of their festivals held there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, ‘Fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of a vow which involves disobedience to Allah, or with regard to a thing the son of Adam does not own</span>.’”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Abu Dawud through a Sahih Sanad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not enter to the Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in their churches on the day of their festivals, for Wrath descends upon them</strong></span>.” He (may Allah be pleased with him) also said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Keep away from the enemies of Allah on their festivals.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who settles in the land of the non-Muslims and celebrates their Nayruz (New Year’s Day) and their Mahrajaan (two non-Islamic Persian festivals), and keeps imitating them until they die in that state, will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fourth</span></strong>: Muslims are prohibited from observing the festivals of the Kafirs for many reasons, some of which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Imitating them in some of their festivals will give them delight and complacency in their falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Imitation and similarity in external matters will inevitably leads one to imitating them and behaving like them in internal matters such as their corrupt beliefs, and being slowly and subtly won over to their way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. One of the gravest ensuing corruptions is that imitating the Kafirs in external matters generates a kind of love, friendship and loyalties that are incompatible with Iman (Faith), as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Mujadalah, 58: 22" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="You(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85)"></a>Y<span style="color:#008000;">ou (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Based on the above, it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah as their Lord, Islam as their religion, and Muhammad as their Prophet to celebrate any festival that has no basis in the Din of Islam, and that includes the so-called new millennium. Neither are they permitted to attend such festivals or take part in them, or to help others do so in any way whatsoever, because this is sin and transgression of the limits set by Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to cooperate, in any way, with the Kafirs with regard to their festivals &#8211; including the new millennium under discussion &#8211; by publicizing and announcing them, or propagating them by any means, whether through the mass media, or by setting up digital clocks and notice boards, manufacturing clothing and memorabilia, printing cards or school notebooks, announcing sales, offering prizes, organizing sport events, or producing special slogans or logos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: It is not permissible for Muslims to consider the festivals of the Kafirs &#8211; including the millennium &#8211; to be happy occasions or blessed times for taking the day off work, getting married, starting a business or beginning new projects, etc. It is not permissible to believe that these days are more special than other days; because these are just like any other days.This is a corrupt belief that does not change the reality of these days in the slightest. Such beliefs are nothing but sin upon sin. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Eighth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to congratulate the Kafirs on their festivals, as this implies a kind of approval of their false beliefs and makes them happy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for offering congratulations on the special ritualistic occasions of Kufr (disbelief), this is agreed to be Haram (prohibited), such as congratulating them (the Kafirs) for their festivals and fasts by saying, ‘Happy or blessed festival to you’ and the like. Even if the one who says so escapes committing Kufr, it is still Haram. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the Cross; in fact it is even more sinful in the Sight of Allah and more hateful than congratulating someone for drinking Khamr (intoxicants), killing a soul, or committing adultery, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their Din fall into this error; they do not realize the abhorrence of their action. Anyone who congratulate a person for committing an act of disobedience, Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) or Kufr exposes themselves to the Hate and Wrath of Allah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Ninth</strong></span>: It honors the Muslims to abide by the <strong>Hijri (lunar) calendar</strong> which is based on the date of Hijrah (migration) of their Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Madinah, upon which the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) consensually agreed, and they dated events according to it without celebrating it. Muslims have followed in their footsteps and passed on this heritage for fourteen centuries to our present day. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon the Hijri calendar and adopt the calendar of any other nation on earth, such as the Gregorian. This means exchanging that which is better for that which is worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, therefore, advise all Muslims to have Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and to act in obedience to Allah, keep away from sins, and to exhort one another to persevere in this and be patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let every believer be true to their soul and strive to save it from the Wrath of Allah and His Curse in this world and the Hereafter by actualizing their knowledge and Iman. They should take Allah as their Guide, Helper, Lawgiver, and Protector, for He is the Best Protector and the Best Helper. Indeed, sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let them also repeat the Du‘a’ (supplication) of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="OAllah!LordofJibril,Mika%E2%80%99il,"></a><span id="19858"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">O Allah! Lord of Jibril, Mika’il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, You will judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ. Guide me to the truth of that wherein they differed, by Your leave, for You guide whomsoever You will to the Straight Path</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no: 29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Category: Fatwas about Aqîda (Creed) and Tauhîd (monotheism)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><strong>The Question:</strong></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>I am an Algerian young man; religiously upright (If Allah </strong></b><b><strong>سبحانه wills). I have lived in Canada for a long time and I try to leave it as soon as possible. But I do not have a residence to settle down in my country.</strong></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So, is it permissible to get the Canadian passport (with some conditions I will mention later on) since it enables me to leave this country and enter the Gulf States and try to settle there?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And here are the conditions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>First:</strong></b> Indeed getting the Canadian passport will not invalidate my Algerian nationality but it will be the original one, this is confirmed by their laws and the Algerian country accepts plurality of nationalities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>Second:</strong></b> I am able to renounce this passport whenever I want, without having problems. This is also confirmed by their laws.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>Third:</strong></b> I can avoid the oath of respecting the Queen, her children and the King as long as I sit in the back of the room without uttering a word.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May you be helpful for us (by your answer) and May Allah bless you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><strong>The answer:</strong></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Peace and blessing be upon whom Allah sent as a mercy to the Worlds, upon his Family, his Companions and his Brothers till The Day of Resurrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not allowed to acquire the disbelievers’ nationality even with keeping the original one, because of the negative aspects which affect the Muslim’s religion and creed. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is enough to know what results from implicit contentment in applying the disbelievers’ customs and laws of that country, besides referring to them as judges and showing pride in being a Canadian citizen and all that engenders; in terms of allegiance and friendship toward them and imitating them in their words and deeds.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contradicts the completeness of faith or nullifies it, according to the situation. Allah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>﴿لاَ تَجِدُ قوْمًا يُؤْمِنُوْنَ بِاللهِ وَاليَوْمِ الآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوا آباءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ…﴾</b>[المجادلة: 22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of the meaning of the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>﴾</b><b>You (O Mohammad </b><b>صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم</b><b>) will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Mohammad </b><b>صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم</b><b>), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their kindred (people)…</b><b>﴿</b></span> [Al-Mujâdilah (The Woman Who Disputes): 22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Muslim is called to complete his religion and increase his faith in calling to Allah تعالى and showing Islam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And among the conditions of traveling to the country of disbelief is to manifest the religion and reveal its rites in a complete way without any opposition to any of them; with the capacity of being loyal to the Muslims and disavowal to the disbelievers. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those who are not able to do so are obliged to go back to the place they came from and try hard to look for a job and get satisfied with littleness and ask Allah for success. He is the Best Helper and the Best Provider.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The perfect knowledge belongs to Allah. Our last prayer is all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Peace and blessing be upon our Prophet, his Family, his Companions and Brothers till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ali Ferkous<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[57] <strong>Question</strong>: One of the students of knowledge asked: Many school students ask one another concerning the ruling on leaving one&#8217;s hair to grow and shaving it off. They are confused about this issue because of what the school presses on them from the obligation of shaving all of the head or cutting it very short and because eof what the students see from some practicing teachers who let their hair grow and do not cut it, but they maintain and groom it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So therefore I say [33] – seeking assistance from Allaah – that leaving the hair is Sunnah, as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<em>It is sunnah. If we were able to manage and control it, we would keep it. But there is discomfort and trouble with (keeping) it (long)</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> And Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said in Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<em>And it was not preserved from him, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that he used to shave his head except during the sacrificial ceremonies of Hajj (nusuk)</em>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are many authentic ahaadeeth that clarify the description of the Prophet&#8217;s sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam hair. It is stated in Al-Mughnee:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;<em>It is recommended that a person&#8217;s hair be according to the description of the Prophet&#8217;s hair. If it is long, then it should go to his shoulders and if it is short, then to the earlobes. And if it grows longer than that, then there is no harm in that. This has been reported on Ahmad</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] These are still the words of the questioner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">keeping one&#8217;s hair and leaving it to grow</span></strong> must meet certain requirements, among which are:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">There must be <strong>sincerity</strong> to Allaah, the Most High and following of the guidance of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, in order to attain reward and merit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">There should be <strong>no imitation of women</strong> in his leaving of the hair to grow, such that he does with his hair what the women do with their hair, from the aspects of beautification that is specific to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">He should not desire by it to <strong>imitate the People of the Book or anyone else among the idol worshippers</strong>. Or in imitation of the haircuts and hairstyles of sinful Muslims, such as music and film artists or whoever treads their way, such as the shameless ones among the sports figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">One should <strong>clean it and groom it every other day</strong>. And it is recommended to oil it, perfume it and split it down the middle of the head. And if it grows long, then one can put it in locks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shaving the hair off</strong></span>, then Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah has written a detailed discussion on this subject and divided it into four types. A summary of what he said is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the shaving of the head is done for <strong>(1) Hajj or &#8216;Umrah</strong> or <strong>(2) for a necessity such as medical treatment</strong>, then this is established and prescribed in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and there is no doubt about it&#8217;s allowance (under these circumstances). As for it being done for any other reason besides those mentioned above, then it falls into being one of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(3) First:</strong> That he shaves it with the intention of making <strong>worship to Allaah (ta&#8217;abbud)</strong>, to practice his Religion (tadayyun) and to abstain from the worldly affairs (zuhd) and not for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah. An example of this is such as his making the shaving of the head a trademark of the people of piety and Religion or from the highest level of abstinence and worship. Or that he places those who shave their heads as being better or more practicing or more pious than those who don&#8217;t shave it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is an innovation that neither Allaah nor His Messenger sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam commanded. It is neither obligatory nor recommended according to any of the Imaams of the Religion. Nor was it done by the Companions and those who followed them in righteousness, nor by the scholars who were well known for their piety and their worship, whether from the Companions, the Taabi&#8217;een, those who followed them or those that came after them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(4) Second:</strong> That he shaves his head for a reason other than the sacrifice of Hajj or &#8216;Umrah, and for other than a necessity, and not for trying to please or get closer to Allaah. The scholars have two opinions concerning this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first opinion:</strong> The dislike of it: This is the madh-hab of Maalik and others and it is found in one of the reports on Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: &#8220;They used to dislike that.&#8221; The proof used by those who hold this opinion is that shaving the head is a trademark of the people of innovation, for the Khawaarij used to shave their heads. And the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Their sign is the shaving of the head.&#8221; Also, some of the Khawaarij consider the shaving of the head as the completion of repentance and religious sacrifices. It is established in the Saheeh that: &#8220;When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was distributing the war booty on the Day of the Conquest, a man with a thick beard and a shaved head came to him…&#8221; And it is stated in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves his head.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;The one who shaves his head persistently is a devil.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second opinion:</strong> Its allowance: This is the most known opinion with the followers of Abu Haneefah and Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee and it is found in a report from Ahmad also. And their proof is what Ahmad, Abu Dawood and An-Nasaa&#8217;ee have reported with an authentic chain, as has been stated by the author of Muntaqaa Al-Akhbaar, on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, that: &#8220;The Prophet sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw a young boy who had shaved part of his head and left the rest of it, so he forbade them from that. And he said to them: &#8216;(Either) shave all of it or leave all of it.'&#8221; Afterwards, three small children were brought to him and he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, shaved their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because he forbade <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-qaz&#8217;</strong></span>, and that is to have some of the head shaved, then this provides evidence for the allowance of shaving all of it. Ash-Shawkaanee said in Nail-ul-Awtaar commenting on the hadeeth that the author of Al-Muntaqaa mentioned: &#8220;In it is proof for the allowance of shaving all of the head. Al-Ghazaalee said: &#8216;There is no harm in it for the one who desires cleanliness.&#8217; And in this is a refutation against those who hold that it is disliked.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is stated in Al-Mughnee: &#8220;Hanbal said: &#8216;My father and I used to shave our heads during the lifetime of Abu &#8216;Abdillaah. So he would see us while we had our heads shaved and he would not forbid us from it.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr said: &#8220;The scholars have unanimously agreed upon the allowance of shaving the head. And this is sufficient as a proof.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I say,[34] and with Allaah lies the success, this second opinion is what is more established to me due to the authenticity of its reports and their conclusiveness. And Allaah knows best. As for the school&#8217;s executive board preventing the general mass of students from letting their hair grow, then this regulation is only in the way of &#8220;suppressing the means and preventing the evil.&#8221; And this is because of what the school has noted in that a group of students, not small in number, keep their hair long not for the sake of following the Sunnah. But rather, they only do so for the sake of resembling and imitating the famous amongst the shameless celebrities and sports figures, regardless of whether they are Muslims or not. And this is done by them combing their hair in a manner that resembles the hair of these celebrities, expressing their love for them, their amazement with them and with what they are upon. Also, the harm of these students, who blindly follow, is not just limited to themselves and that&#8217;s all. Rather, their influence extends to their school colleagues and so they become affected by this false way, which leads to the wearing down of the students to having weak souls amidst their group. This is especially since they are in this age in which they have constantly changing personalities, numerous desires, and are quick to be influenced and quick to make make decisions. So you will find that the student at this age will receive more influence from his colleagues in school than from the incentives of his teachers or even his parents!! This is what I have to say and Allaah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[34] These are still the questioner&#8217;s words</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, and may the peace and blessings be upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance. To proceed, I strongly support the words that were stated in the last part of the fatwaa for it is traced back to an important legal principle, which is &#8220;Preventing the evil (mafsadah) comes before bringing about the good (maslahah).&#8221; So how can it be when there is no sort of maslahah (beneficial good), but only imitation of the disbelievers or the sinful people? And the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;…And whoever imitates a people is one of them.&#8221; There are many other ahaadeeth in various subjects of the Religion that bear this same meaning. I have mentioned about forty ahaadeeth from them in my book &#8220;Hijaab Al-Ma&#8217;at-ul-Muslimah&#8221;, which I have printed recently under the title &#8220;Jilbaab Al-Mar&#8217;at-ul-Muslimah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, I will always give the ruling that it is not permissible for the male youth and students to let their hair grow long and that they should either shave it off or cut it short, as the general masses of Muslims are doing today, and with Allaah lies the success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And furthermore, it is not for anyone to say today that it is disliked to shave the head, for there is no proof for that other than that it was a trademark of the Khawaarij. But today, they – and from among them are the Ibaadiyyah – do not adhere to this practice anymore, from what I know. And if they are found in some land to still be abiding by this practice, then the people of that land should contradict them in that due to what has been stated previously. And if this is not the case, then the fundamental principle is the allowance (to cut), as is stated in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar which has been authenticated in Al-Muntaqaa. And Muslim has also reported it as I have verified in Al-Ahaadeeth As- Saheehah (no. 1123).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves his head&#8221; then it is a shortened version of the hadeeth of Abu Moosaa Al-Ash&#8217;aree, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, with the wording: &#8220;He is not from us who shaves (his head), tears (his clothes) and wails.&#8221; This is the way a group of the scholars have reported the hadeeth, such as Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad (4/411) and the two Shaikhs in their (respective) Saheeh collections. Al-Bukhaaree introduced it in his Saheeh by saying: &#8220;Chapter: What is forbidden from the act of shaving due to a calamity.&#8221; So therefore, the hadeeth is specific for someone who shaves his head as a means of announcing his grief due to the death of one of his relatives. What consists of this person&#8217;s objection of Allaah&#8217;s Divine Ordainment is the Prophet&#8217;s, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, linking it to his words &#8220;tears&#8221;, meaning his clothes and &#8220;wails&#8221; meaning raises his voice in wailing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what supports this is the occasion in which Abu Moosaa Al-Ash&#8217;aree, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, reported this hadeeth, for he reported it at the time when he was on his deathbed as occurs in the two Saheehs. And it is verified in Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel (no. 771) and in Ahkaam-ul-Janaa&#8217;iz. As for the narration from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas that has been mentioned in the previous fatwaa, then I have not come across its chain of narration and I do not deem that it is authentic. But if it is authentic, then it is likely that it is in reference to imitation of the Khawaarij based on what has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that growing the hair on one&#8217;s head long is Sunnah, then there is no proof for it by which an argument can be established. And it is not sufficient in that regard to say that it is authentically reported on the Prophet (that he had long hair), for that was from his customs (&#8216;aadaat). And it has also been authentically reported on him, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that he entered Makkah while having four locks (of tied hair), as is mentioned in my book &#8220;Mukhtasar Ash-Shamaa&#8217;il Al-Muhammadiyyah&#8221; (35/23). And &#8220;locks &#8221; means braids and plaits. But this was just an Arab custom, which some of them did not do all the time. So can it be said that this was the Sunnah also? Of course not! So then in customs like this, there must be a specific proof that asserts that it is a Sunnah of worship. But how can this be when the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has placed an equality between the one who shaves his hair and the one who leaves it to grow as is found in his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying: &#8220;(Either) shave all of it or leave all of it.&#8221; Rather, he shaved those three children&#8217;s heads as was mentioned in the fatwaa. And that is an authentic hadeeth also, which I have verified in my book &#8220;Ahkaam Al-Janaa&#8217;iz wa Bid&#8217;ihaa&#8221; (pg. 166).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not for any of the youth that are being tested with imitation of the disbelievers or of the sinful people in their hairstyles, to use the &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; as a pretext (i.e. excuse), for it is a Sunnah of custom and not a Sunnah of worship. And this is especially since many of these youth do not imitate the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, in what is obligatory upon them, such as trimming the moustache and growing the beard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, in that there is a reminder for he who has a heart or lends his ear, while he is heedful.&#8221; [Surah Qaaf: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfect are You, O Allaah, from all imperfections, and by Your praise, I bear witness that no deity has the right to be worshipped except You. I seek forgiveness in You and repent to You.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some of our Muslim brethren hold birthday parties for themselves and their children, what is the ruling on such festivals? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic principle regarding acts of <strong>Ibadah</strong> (worship) is that they are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and as such, no one is allowed to worship Allah in a way other than which He ordained, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected. </span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. </span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Birthday parties are an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion) that should not be done for any person, regardless of their rank or role in life. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable of all creation and the best of all Messengers (peace be upon them), i.e. Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullah (peace be upon him) was never reported to have held a festival for the day he was born, or even instructed his Ummah (nation based on one creed) to celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the best of this Ummah after its Prophet (peace be upon him) are the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), but none of them is reported to have made a festival for the Prophet&#8217;s birthday, or for any of them (may Allah be pleased with them), and all goodness is to be found in following their pathand patterning oneself after the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, such Bid`ah pave the way to<strong> imitate the Jews, Christians and other Kafirs</strong> (non-Muslims) in terms of their newly invented festivals. Allah is the One sought for help!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on organizing celebrations for the birthdays of children or for wedding anniversaries?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no celebrations in Islaam except Friday the weekly ‘Eid, the first day of Shawwal – ’Eidal-Adha. The day of ’Arafah might be called an ‘Eid for those who are at’Arafah on that day, and the days of Tashreeq, following ’Eidul-Adha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for birthday celebrations for a person or his children, or wedding anniversaries or the like, none of them are legislated and they are closer to being innovations than to being allowed</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer to a <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=801&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Question</strong> </a>Posed to Permanent Committee :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: `Eid (festival) means in Arabic gatherings that Ta&#8217;ud (comes again) on a habitual manner. It may come again in a year, a month, or a week. Therefore, the word &#8216;Eid means a day that comes again like `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) or Friday, the gathering on that day and the acts done as acts of worship or habits on that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Anything that is meant to worship Allah, seek to be closer to Him to get reward through doing so or any thing meant to be similar to disbelievers and the like is a Bid`ah that is included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span>&#8221; This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. <strong>Celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s Mawlid, Mother&#8217;s Day, and National Day fall into this category.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one includes an act of worship that was not legislated by Allah. Moreover, it contains similarity to the Christians and other disbelievers. <strong>The second and the third are prohibited as it is imitating disbelievers</strong>. Whatever is in the interest of the Ummah (nation) and arranging its affairs as the Week of the Traffic, arranging the times of studying, holding meetings with employees to arrange work and the like are not acts of worship, they are of the innovated habits that are not included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.&#8221;</span> Then, there will be no blame for doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: islamcast.wordpress.com/2009/03/29<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I warn my Muslim brothers against what some stupid people do when they narrate april jokes. This lie have they taken from the jews, the christians, fire-worshipers (Majûs) and other disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only is this act a lie, which is in itself forbidden according to the Sharî’ah, it also involves imitating the disbelievers, which is forbidden. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever imitates a people belongs to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Its chain of narration is good.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The least one could say is that it is forbidden, even if it seemingly entails disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Together with these two sins, the Muslim becomes humiliated before his enemy. It is generally known that the one who is imitated boasts before the imitator and sees himself as being in front of him. The imitator thus becomes weak so that he imitates him. The believer thusly becomes degraded since he subjugates himself and follows the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth sin is that this filthy lie is often about taking someone else’s money unjustly and scaring the Muslims. They maybe lie and tell the family that they will be having guests. As a result thereof they prepare a great meal and meat and the like. They might also lie and tell them horrifying news of a relative being run over by a car or the like. This is not allowed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Fatwa no. 21203<br />
Fatwa from Permanent Committee :</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day on February 14 by exchanging red roses, dressing in red, and congratulating one another on that day. Some cake shops make heart-shaped cakes in red and draw hearts on them and other shops advertise special items on sale for this day. What is your opinion on: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong>: Celebrating this day?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second</strong>: Buying from these stores on this day? </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong>: Shop owners who do not celebrate this day selling gifts to be given by those who do celebrate it? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clear-cut evidence from the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, upon which the <em>Salaf</em> (righteous predecessors) of this <em>Ummah</em> (nation based on one creed) unanimously agreed, confirms that there are only two <em>Eids</em> (festivals) in Islam: <em>Eid-ul-Fitr</em> (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) and <em>Eid-ul-Adha</em> (the Festival of the Sacrifice). Any other festival, whether peculiar to a person, a group, an event, or any other reason, is an invented festival that is not permissible for Muslims to celebrate, approve of, enjoy, or support in any way, because this is considered to be a transgression of the Limits of Allah.  Anyone who transgresses the limits set by Allah has wronged themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we add to this fabricated festival the fact that it is one of the festivals of the <em>Kafirs</em> (disbelievers), this heaps sin upon sin, because it entails resembling them and is a type of support of them. Allah (may He be Glorified) forbids the <em>Mumins</em> (believers), in His Ever-Glorious Book, from imitating or supporting the <em>Kafirs</em>. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Anyone who imitates a people is one of them</strong></span>.&#8221; (Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on clothing, no. 4031; Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 50). Valentine&#8217;s Day falls under this heading, as it is one of the idolatrous Christian festivals. It is not lawful for a Muslim who believes in Allah and the Last Day to celebrate, approve of, or congratulate people on it; it is forbidden to them. Rather, it is obligatory for them to ignore and avoid it, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger and to keep away from that which will arouse Allah&#8217;s Anger and incur Punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is also <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) for Muslims to support this festival or any other <em>Haram</em> festival by any means, whether by supplying food or drinks; selling, buying, manufacturing, gift-giving, correspondence, advertising etc., because all this comes under cooperating in sin and transgression and disobeying Allah and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in <em>Al-Birr</em> and <em>At-Taqwa</em> </strong>(virtue, righteousness and piety)<strong>; but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment.&#8221;</strong></span> (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory for Muslims to adhere to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah in all matters, especially in times of <em>Fitnah</em> (trial) when corruption is widespread. They must be sagacious enough and on their guard to avoid falling into the misguidance of those who have earned Allah&#8217;s Anger, those who went astray, or the <em>Fasiqs</em> (those flagrantly violating Islamic law) who have no fear of Allah nor have pride in being Muslims. Muslims should resort to Allah, asking for guidance and steadfastness in Islam, as it is Allah Alone Who guides and keeps us steadfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21079</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: On 12/8/1420 A.H. notices were placed on the roads of Riyadh conveying congratulations from the Banque Saudi Fransi on the <span id="ContentParagraph" style="font-family:tahoma;">New Year</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Employees of the Banque Saudi Fransi wish the Saudi people a merry year. Respected shaykh, it undoubtedly hurts every Muslim to find things like this common in the land of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques, the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I hope that Your Honor will clarify the ruling of Islam on this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Muslim is prohibited to congratulate the disbelievers, Christians, Jews or whomever, on their distinctive occasions. This involves a sort of agreeing with them on their falsehood and being loyal to them. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Similarly, a Muslim is prohibited to congratulate his Muslim brother on the feasts and celebrations of the disbelievers. By doing so, a Muslim imitates them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims must resent disbelievers, dissociate themselves from them and hate their disbelief and disobedience to Allah, as Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><strong>Anyone who imitates a people becomes one of them</strong>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah </span>commented on this Hadith saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>This Hadith at least implies that it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers though it apparently signifies the disbelief of the imitator</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow' id=" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: Is it permissible to stand in honor of a national anthem or flag?</p>
<p>A: It is not permissible for a Muslim to stand in honor of a national anthem or flag; this is a repudiated Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) as it did not happen during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) or that of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them). It also runs counter to the perfection of due, pure Tawhid (monotheism) and to the sincerity of dedicating all glorifications to Allah Alone. It is a means that can lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and involves imitation of the Kufar (disbelievers) and their bad customs, as well as their excessive glorification of their leaders and their exaggerated ceremonies. The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited acting like and imitating the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>
