<p><strong>Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen<br />Chapter 191 &#8211; The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1066. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform Salat (prayer) in his house. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “<strong>Do you hear the Adhan (call to prayer)?</strong>” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then directed him to respond to it. [Muslim].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1067. Abdullah bin Umm Maktum, the Mu’adhdhin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): “<strong>There are many poisonous insects and wild beasts in Al-Madinah, and I am blind. Please grant me permission to perform Salat at home</strong>.” He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired whether he could hear the call: Hayyaalas-Salah; Hayya `alal-Falah (Come to the prayer, come to the salvation). When he replied in affirmative, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed him to come (to mosque) for prayer.” [Abu Dawud].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1068. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, “<strong>By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I sometimes thought of giving orders for firewood to be collected, then for proclaiming the Adhan for Salat. Then I would appoint an Imam to lead Salat, and then go to the houses of those who do not come to perform Salat in congregation, and set fire to their houses on them</strong>.” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1069. Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: &#8220;<strong>He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow (i.e., on the Day of Requital) as a Muslim, should take care and observe the Salat when the Adhan is announced for them. Allah has expounded to your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the ways of right guidance, and these (the prayers) are part of the right guidance. If you have to perform Salat in your houses, as this man who stays away (from the mosque) and performs Salat in his house, you will abandon the Sunnah (practice) of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and the departure from the Sunnah of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) will lead you astray. I have seen the time when no one stayed behind except a well-known hypocrite. I also saw that a man was brought swaying (on account of weakness) between two men till he was set up in a row (in the mosque)</strong>.&#8221; [Muslim].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that <em>masaajid</em> (the places of prayer) are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18] <strong><sup>9</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><u>S</u>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">ألا إن من كان قبلكم كانوا يتخذون القبور مساجد</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"> ألا فلا تتخذوا القبور مساجد فإني أﻧﻬاكم عن ذلك</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">لعنة الله على اليهود والنصارى اتخذوا قبور أنبيائهم مساجد</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the places where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<u>H</u>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لَّا تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْئًا وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْقَائِمِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><u>T</u>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration.</strong></span> [22:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا تَدْعُو</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not call upon or invoke</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<strong><em>tad‘oo</em></strong>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<strong><em>a<u>h</u>adan</em></strong>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah.</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the places of prayer are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الله لا يقبل إلا طيبا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Allah does not accept except what is good and pure</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show of, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 76 : Point 128</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whoever abandons the <em>Jumu’ah</em> Prayer and the congregational prayers in the mosque, without a valid excuse, then he is an innovator </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. The valid excuse is such as an illness, because of which he is unable to go out to the mosque, or fear of an oppressive ruler and whatever is besides that then there is no excuse for you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Congregational payer in the mosque is an obligation upon the sane, adult males who are able to attend. This is the most correct saying of the scholars.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform <em>Salat</em> (prayer) in his house. He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “Do you hear the <em>Adhan</em> (call to prayer)?” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) then directed him to respond to it.</span></p>
<p>[Muslim]. <a title="[Riyad-us-Saliheen] The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/04/riyad-us-saliheen-imaam-nawawi-chapter-191/">[The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</a> – Riyadh ul saaliheen]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiAllaahu anhu</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever would be happy to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, then let him preserve (in establishing) these five prayers from the place where they are called from (i.e. masjids), for verily, Allaah has legislated for your Prophet the ways of guidance. And indeed these (five prayers in the masjid) are from the ways of guidance. And if you were to pray in your homes as this man who refrains (to pray in the masjid) prays in his home, then you would have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet. And if you were to abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet (s<em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>) you would go astray. There is not a man that performs the ablution and does it well, then sets out to go to one of these masjids except that Allaah records a good deed for him for every step he takes and raises him up one level and erases one evil deed due to it. You have certainly seen us, and no one would refrain from the prayer (in the masjid) except the hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And indeed a man would be brought supported by two men until he was made to stand in the row (for prayer).”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Leaving the Masjid after the Adhan is announced</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 5133</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on leaving the Masjid (mosque) after the Adhan (call to Prayer)? Moreover, does the same ruling apply to a person who may be in a room, not used for Salah, within the precincts of the Masjid but when leaving, he passes through the courtyard of the Masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible to leave the Masjid after hearing the Adhan except to perform Wudu&#8217;, answering the call of nature, or any other necessity. It is reported that Abu Hurayrah  saw a person leaving the Masjid after the Adhan. Upon this he remarked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;This (man) disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (peace be upon him).&#8221;</strong> </span>Related by Muslim in his Sahih. The same ruling applies for a person who is in a room inside the precincts of the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] What is the ruling regarding leaving the Masjid after the Adhan has been called?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A] Abu Hurayrah saw a man leave (the Masjid) after the Adhan (had been called) and said (about him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">As for this (one), then he has gone against (the teachings of) Abul-Qasim (Muhammad, peace be upon him</span>)</strong></span>.(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to go against (the teachings) principally is prohibited. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</strong></span> (Quran, 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, because of this, the people having Islamic knowledge have said: <span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Indeed it is not permissible for a person to leave the Masjid after the Adhan (has been called) except for an (Islamically justifiable) reason, such as leaving to make Wudhu or if he wanted to go to answer the call of nature, then he is permitted to leave, even if he misses the prayer</strong></span> as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">There is no prayer if food has been served or for him who needs to answer the call of nature</span></strong>. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if we say that someone is waiting for the prayer and then felt the need to go and answer the call of nature or even to pass wind, since some people (may be in) need of passing wind, then there is no harm if he left and relieved himself (and) then returned. And if he was able to (catch and) join the congregation, then it is a blessing, and if he was unable to do so, then there is no harm in this.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen wa sallalaahu ala nabeeyena Muhammad wa alaa alihi wa sahbhi wa sallama tasleeman kaseera</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Question is why was the Ka&#8217;abah called Baytullah Al Haraam, The inviolable house of Allah ?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ka&#8217;bah was called Baytullah i.e The House of Allah. That is because it is the place of magnification of Allah(عز و جل) Most Mighty and Most Majestic.People come to it from all places in order to offer an obligation which Allah had ordained upon them and also because people direct themselves in its direction while in their prayers, wherever they may be fulfilling one of the conditions of the Salah i.e. directing one self towards the Qibla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) stated in Surah Al- Baqarah (2:144) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ‌ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةً۬ تَرۡضَٮٰهَا‌ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ‌ۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُ ۥ‌ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبَ لَيَعۡلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلۡحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمۡ‌ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعۡمَلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Harâm (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what they do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) narrated it to Himself added it when he mentioned the Ka&#8217;abah as an honour and magnification of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because that which is related to Allah in the construct of the statements by Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The Attribute of Himself (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)<br />
2) The creature of  his creation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is an attribute, then it is related because it is established with Him and Allah(عز و جل) is qualified by it, it is His attribute like Allah&#8217;s hearing, Allah&#8217;s sight, Allah&#8217;s knowledge, Allah&#8217;s ability, Allah&#8217;s speech and other than that from His most mighty and magnificent attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it s a creature from his creation, then it is added to Allah (عز و جل) in the construct as away of honouring and magnification and in this way Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)  related the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself when He said in Surah Al Hajj (22:26):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِىَ لِلطَّآٮِٕفِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim (Abraham) the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Islamic Monotheism], and sanctify <span style="color:#ff0000;">My House</span> for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.);&#8221; )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said &#8216;My House&#8217; (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى). He narrated it it to Himself in the construct of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also He added to Himself the masaajid (the Mosques) as He said in Surah Al Baqarah (2:114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومن اظلم ممن منع مساجد الله ان يذكر فيها اسمه وسعى في خرابها اولئك ما كان لهم ان يدخلوها الا خائفين لهم في الدنيا خزي ولهم في الاخرة عذاب عظيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And who is more unjust than those who forbid Allah&#8217;s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in <span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah&#8217;s Mosques</span> and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah&#8217;s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see that now, Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) added the mosques in the  construct to Himself in the relation &#8216; &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Mosques&#8221; and also  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) He may do the same regarding some of his creatures in order to make clear His comprehensive possession as in His statement  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) in Surah Al Jasiya (45:13):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;وسخر لكم ما في السماوات وما في الارض جميعا منه ان في ذلك لايات لقوم يتفكرون&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him. Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore  in summary  Allah  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) referred the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself as an honour and magnification and no one should think that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) reffered the ka&#8217;abah to Himself because it is &#8220;a place in which He resides&#8221;. This is impossible because (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses everything and nothing from his creatures encompass Him, rather His Kursee(سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses the Heavens and the Earth, as Allah Stated in Surah Al Baqarah (2:255) that his Kursee extends over the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Surah Zumar (39:67):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وما قدروا الله حق قدره والارض جميعا قبضته يوم القيامة والسماوات مطويات بيمينه سبحان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is above His heavens ascended the throne in the most majestic way that befits Him and it&#8217;s not possible that He ( سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) dwells in any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 5: Is it permissible for the Imam to perform Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after performing the prescribed prayer while all the people are still present?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Acts of worship are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion). Therefore, it is not legally permitted to say that this act of worship is permissible with regard to its origin, number, manner or place without legal evidence for saying so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) where he did this, either from his sayings, doings or what gains his consent. All blessings are in following his guidance. The guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is established with authentic proofs that denote what he (peace be upon him) did after Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). The successors, the Companions of the Prophet and those who followed them in righteousness followed his example in this regard. Whoever innovates anything other than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), his acts will be rejected. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who did any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, that is to be rejected</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam who makes Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after Taslim and the followers pronounce Ta&#8217;min (saying: &#8220;Amin&#8221;) after his Du`a&#8217; should be asked to bring evidence that proves his deeds. Otherwise, his acts will be rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we will give an outline about the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after Taslim. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) pronounced Taslim, he used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Allah, You are the Grantor of security, and security comes from You. You are Blessing, O You Who have majesty and nobility)!&#8221; </strong>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awza`y was asked about the manner of the Prophet&#8217;s asking for forgiveness. He answered: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: &#8216;I seek the forgiveness of Allah. I seek the forgiveness of Allah</span></strong>.'&#8221; This is the narration of Muslim, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa&#8217;y. But Al-Nasa&#8217;y said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say that upon finishing his prayer, and then mentioned the Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After finishing his prayer, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: O Allah! You are Peace</strong></span>.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#8217;y on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) pronounced salutation, he used to say: O Allah: You are peace, and peace comes from You, blessed are You, Possessor of Glory and Honor</strong>.&#8221;[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported on the authority of Warrad the scriber of the servant of Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah that he said that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah dictated to me a letter to Mu`awiyah that When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) finished the prayer and pronounced salutation he uttered (this supplication): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone, Who has no partner. To Him belongs the sovereignty and to Him praise is due and He is Potent over everything. O Allah! No one can withhold what You give, or give what You withhold, and the riches cannot avail a wealthy person with You. </strong>[5]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim reported in his Sahih on the authority of `Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He used to say at the end of every prayer after pronouncing salutation (these words): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone. There is no partner with Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him and He is Potent over everything. There is no might or power except with Allah. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah and we do not worship but Him alone. To Him belong all bounties, to Him belongs all Grace, and to Him is worthy praise accorded. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah, to Whom we are sincere in devotion, even though the unbelievers should disapprove it</span></strong>. <strong>He added: The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say so after pronouncing salutation at the end of every prayer. </strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration reported also by Muslim the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He who recites after every prayer: Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from imperfection) thirty-three times; Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty-three times; Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greatest) thirty-three times; and completes a hundred with: La ilaha illallahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai&#8217;in Qadir (there is no true god except Allah. He is One and He has no partner with Him. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Omnipotent), will have all his sins pardoned even if they may be as the foam on the surface of the sea</span></strong>.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who wants to know more supplications should read supplications in the comprehensive books like Jami` Al-&#8216;Ousoul, Majm` Al-Zawa&#8217;d, Al-Matalib Al-`Aliyah Bi Zawa&#8217;d Al-Masanid Al-Thamaniyah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is a woman that is menstruating or in her post-partum period allowed to touch the mus-haf or read from it? Also, is the menstruating woman allowed to enter the masjid in order to gain religious knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abdulazeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The menstruating woman is not allowed to sit in the masjid nor touch the mus-haf until she has become purified. However, if a need for her to touch it arose, such as in order to revise a verse (of the Qur&#8217;an) or something like that, there is no problem to do so by wearing gloves or by using some other barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for touching it without some sort of barrier, then no, she should not do that. This is because her impurity is major, like the one who is impure due to sexual relations (junub). The one who is &#8216;junub&#8217; does not read or touch the mus-haf. As for the menstruating woman, she may recite [the Qur&#8217;an] during the whole period. So can the one in her post-partum period, according to the correct Opinion. She can read from her memory without touching the mus-haf unless she has to in order to revise a verse in which case it is alright if she touches it using a barrier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong>to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (…) than that he should walk between his hands.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying – and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid – and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah – according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that – and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam – which I have mentioned in ‘The Original’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah<br />
</strong>Below in the Transcription of the Audio Explanation of Dawud Burbank</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or worship anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong><sup>9</sup><strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or worship anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid, </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ss</span>alaatuwassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><strong>[1]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the place where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">T</span>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration. [22:26]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do not call upon or invoke [72:18]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<em>tad‘oo</em>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<em>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adan</em>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the places of prayer are for Allaah [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islaamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allah does not accept except what is good and pure”</strong><strong>[3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p><strong>Read the article:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Position of the Ma’muum With Respect to Following the Imaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The position of the ma’muum with respect to following the imaam falls into four categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>1) Getting ahead (musabaqaah)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 2) Conformity (muwafaqaah)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 3) Staying behind (takhalluf)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 4) Following (mutaaba’)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(1) al-Musabaqaah (Going Ahead)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Musabaqaah entails getting ahead of the imaam in either sayings or actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Concerning sayings</strong></span>,</span> it is acceptable to get ahead of the imaam, except in two matters; they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Takbeerat al-Ihraam</strong> – If the follower precedes the imaam in it, then his salaah is invalid, even if he forgot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Tasleem</strong> – If the follower deliberately precedes the imaam in it, then his salaah is nullified. However, if it was unintentional, then he simply repeats it after the imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if someone recites al-Faatiha, the remembrances of sujuud and rukuu, or the tashahhud before the imaam, then there is nothing upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Regarding preceding the imaam <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in actions</span>,</span></strong> it is divided into two situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Going ahead of the imaam to a rukn (pillar)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Someone made rukuu before the imaam. Later, the imaam caught up with him. At this point, the follower should stand up and make rukuu with the imaam, so as to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Going ahead of the imaam by a rukn (pillar)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone made rukuu and then lifts himself up before his imaam bows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Going ahead of the imaam in actions is forbidden in all of its forms and is from the major sins, as evident in the sunnah. If someone knowingly goes ahead of the imaam, then his salaah is invalid. Correspondingly, the salaah of the person who did it ignorantly or due to forgetfulness is valid. However, if the legal excuse (e.g. forgetfulness or ignorance) is lifted before the imaam catches up, then it is incumbent upon the ma’muum to follow the imaam in those acts which he did prematurely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone made sujuud and lifted up from it before his imaam prostrated. Therefore, he must return to position of the imaam and follow him. If his action was done deliberately, then his salaah is invalid; if it was due to ignorance or forgetfulness, then his salaah is valid.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(2) al-Muwafaqaah (Conforming)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Conformity with the imaam can also be through sayings or actions. If it is in sayings, then it is not harmful except in two situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Takbeerat al-Ihraam</strong> – If the follower conforms with the imaam in it, then his salaah is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Tasleem</strong> &#8211; If the follower deliberately conforms with the imaam in it, then his salaah is nullified. Correspondingly, if it was done due to forgetfulness and he returns later to follow his imaam in tasleem, then there is nothing upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also disliked (makrooh) to have conformity with the imaam in actions because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“If he makes rukuu, then make rukuu, and do not make rukuu till he makes rukuu.”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth makes it clear that we should follow the actions of the imaam, not conform with them. As such, if someone conforms with the imaam in sujuud by reaching the ground at the same time as him, then this is disliked; the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said in the same hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not make sujuud until he makes sujuud.”</span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported from al-Baraa ibn ‘Aazib (radiyallaahu ‘anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“When Allaah&#8217;s Messenger said, ‘Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah’ none of us bent his back (for prostration) till the Prophet prostrated, and then we would prostrate after him.”</span> [3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(3) at-Takhalluf (Staying Behind)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Takhalloof is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Staying behind due to a valid excuse – In this situation, the person brings what he failed to perform and follows the imaam. There is nothing upon him, even if he fell behind by a pillar or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) A person did not hear his imaam until the imaam moved ahead of him by a rukn or two. In such a situation, he does that which he failed to perform and then follows his imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) While a person was praying in congregation, he did not hear the imaam make rukuu. However, he later heard the imaam say, “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah.” In this case, the ma’muum makes rukuu and then follows his imaam, without losing the rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if someone lagged behind the imaam to the point that the imaam caught up with him in the next rakaah, then the person does not bring that which he failed to perform at this stage. Instead, he follows his imaam, and this will be the beginning of a new rakaah for him. After the imaam makes tasleem, the ma’muum must make up the rakaah he missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) While a person is praying in congregation, the imaam makes a complete rakaah, but the maamum could not hear the speakers until the imaam began his second rakaah. As such, the ma’muum must follow the imaam, and the imaam’s second rakaah will be his first. Therefore, when the imaam completes his salaah by making tasleem, the ma’muum must stand up and pray an additional rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) During salaat al-jumu’ah, a person heard the imaam reciting al-Fatiha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point, there was a power outage. During the time the electricity was cut, the imaam completed a full rakaah. When the power returned, the ma’muum heard the imaam reciting Surah al-Ghaashiyah (Chapter 88), at which point he realized he missed the first rakaah since this surah is recited during the second rakaah of salaat al-jumu’ah. As such, the ma’muum should remain in his position and follow the imaam, and the imaam’s second’s rakaah will be his first. When the imaam makes tasleem, the ma’muum should then stand for a second rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if the person recognizes his failure to follow the imaam before the imaam reaches the same position as him, then he makes up what he failed to perform and follows the imaam. Otherwise, he follows the imaam and makes up the missing rakaah after the imaam makes tasleem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Staying behind without a valid excuse</strong> – This can either be through staying behind the imaam within a pillar or staying behind him by a pillar. Both are hraam (unlawful) if done deliberately. Staying behind within a pillar entails following the imaam and catching up with him in the pillar he has moved to perform.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: The imaam makes rukuu while the ma’muum is lagging behind having yet to complete one or two verses for a surah he recited after al-Fatiha. Then, the follower completes the surah and catches up with the imaam in rukuu. His action is haraam, and his rukuu is valid but in opposition to the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Staying behind by a pillar involves the imaam going past the ma’muum by an entire pillar. In this case, the ma’muum’s salaah is nullified if there was not a valid excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The imaam makes rukuu and rises from it before the ma’muum has bowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The imaam lifts up from the first sajdah while the ma’muum remains in sujood making du’aa. The imaam then does the second sajdah, preceding the ma’muum by one rukn (pillar). This is common in many mosques, but it nullifies the ma’muum’s salaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(3) al-Mutaaba’ (Following)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the imaam entails the ma’muum performing an action of salaah immediately after the imaam; this is the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The ma’muum follows the imaam into rukuu even if he has yet to finish a second surah after al-Fatiha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) When the imaam lifts his head from sujuud, the ma’muum follows him; this is better than continuing to make du’aa as the ma’muum’s salaah is linked to his imaam, and they are commanded to follow him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Summary</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The position of the ma’muum with respect to following the imaam falls into four<br />
categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Getting ahead (musabaqaah)</strong> – This is forbidden in all of its forms. Anyone who knowingly or intentionally does it invalidates his salaah. However, if it is done out of ignorance or forgetfulness, then the salaah is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Conformity (muwafiqaah)</strong> – This is makrooh (disliked).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3) Staying behind (takhalloof)</strong> – This can be either due to an invalid or valid excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4) Following (mutabbaa’)</strong> – This is the sunnah and correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[37] Question: There are some masjids in which the women pray below the actual masjid, such as in the basement or in an upper level (above the masjid). We are women who pray in these masjids, at times following the Imaam from a point where we are not able to see him nor the male followers. And sometimes there is a large empty space left over in the area of prayer for the men. Is our prayer valid if we cannot see the Imaam or any of the (male) followers, and while knowing that sometimes we enter the masjid and don&#8217;t know what rak&#8217;ah he is in. Is it allowed in this situation to follow (the Imaam) by (hearing) the raised voice only? And is it correct for us to follow the Imaam while we are on an upper or lower level knowing that at times there is ample room in the masjid (floor)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The answer is in two parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> is that the prayer and the mentioned scenario is valid so long as the women pray in the masjid, regardless of whether it is in the upper or lower level. And it is so long as they are able to hear the takbeers from the Imaam indicating the change in position, such as from standing to bowing to prostrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second part</strong> is that it is not proper for the women to pray like this unless the area for the men is filled with people and they (the women) cannot find a place behind the rows for them to pray in. In these circumstances, it is permissible for the women to pray in the upper or lower level of the masjid. But if this masjid, where the Imaam and the men behind him pray, has ample room left over, then it is not allowed for the women to go up to the upper level or down to the lower level where they won&#8217;t be able to see the movements of the Imaam or the movements of the men praying behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">The best rows for the men are their first ones and their worst (rows) are their last ones. And the best rows for women are their last ones and the worst (rows) are their first ones</span></em>&#8220;, he meant by it the same ground that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and his Companions behind him used to pray on. The women were not in upper or lower levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The underlying reason for this is that the speakers at times can be low and at other times they are not working. So the prayer of the women who are following him from an upper or lower level, from which they cannot see the prayer of the Imaam or those behind him, is subject to becoming invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The prayer that is performed while on an upper or lower level is valid. However, it is not permissible to designate those places for prayer when there is enough room in the prayer place (musalla), such that the women are able to pray in the back of it. </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: I hear people saying that using Miswak (tooth-cleansing stick) in the Masjid is impermissible. Is this true?  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Using the Miswak is an affirmed act of Sunnah. It should be used when necessary upon performing <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wudu&#8217; (ablution), Salah, reciting the Qur&#8217;an, changing the mouth smell</strong></span>, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may be used inside or outside the Masjid, as no text supports the prohibition of using it inside the Masjid when necessary. Moreover, it finds further support in the general meaning of the following Hadith, “<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Were it not for the fear that it might be hard for my Ummah (nation), I would have ordered them to use Miswak for every Salah</span></strong>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a person should be careful not to overdo the Miswak in the Masjid lest they should vomit or bleed in the Masjid.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">An Explanation By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> of the book  ‘<em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>’ By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Umm Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani Wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">The Imam Saying <em>Ameen</em> Aloud After Reciting <em>Fatiha</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah  had completed his recitation of <em>Surah</em> Fatiha he would say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>’ raising his voice and he would elongate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would command those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> loudly just after the Imam said it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet  would say: ‘If the Imam recites: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt; </strong> then say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>, for verily the Angels say<em>Ameen</em> and verily the Imam says <em>Ameen</em>,’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in other wording: ‘If the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> then say <em>Ameen</em>, whoever says it and it coincides with the <em>Ameen</em> of the Angels, (and in other wording if one of you says<em>Ameen</em> in his prayer and it coincides with the other) all his previous sins will be forgiven.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadeeth: ‘Say <em>Ameen</em> and Allah will love you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allaah  also said: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">______________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter of saying <em>Ameen</em> has a few issues, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The linguistic meaning of ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is ‘O Allaah respond / answer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said it means ‘<em>Subhanaka</em> <em>Ya</em> <em>Allaah’</em> (How far you are from imperfection) and it has been said it means ‘O Allaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one who prays behind the Imam hears the Imam recite <em>Surah</em> Fatiha and reaches the part that says: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>  Then it is the Sunnah for him to say <em>Ameen</em> after this, as the Messenger of Allaah would say. This is due to the general statement of the saying of the Prophet : ‘Pray as you have seen me praying.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of <em>Ameen</em> is Sunnah for the Imam and those following him. It is the Sunnah for the Imam in those prayers that are audible and he says <em>Ameen</em> audibly/ with a raised voice after he recites Surah Fatiha. It is also the Sunnah for those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> after he finishes reciting <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars -may Allaah have mercy upon them- have mentioned that this is the point at which the saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> of both the Imam and those following him coincide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Shaykh Al-Albaani -may Allaah have mercy on him- during his visit to the Kingdom in the year 1410 A.H. regarding the matter of the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and those who follow him, and the Shaykh -may Allaah have mercy on him- said that it is upon those who are following the prayer to say <em>Ameen</em> just after the Imam, to the count of one or two letters, as the saying of <em>Ameen</em> will then be after the Imam and they will join in saying some of the letters of the word. Therefore, if the Imam says<em>Ameen</em> then those following say it in order for some of the letters of the word to coincide with one another, and at the same time the Imam will precede in one or two letters of the word. Thus in this manner the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and the followers will coincide in some of the letters and the end result will be that the saying of <em>Ameen</em> by the follower will be just after the <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The virtue of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>. The author -may Allaah have mercy on him- mentions from the Messenger , that if the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> and the Angels say <em>Ameen</em> and those following say <em>Ameen</em>, and they coincide with one another Allaah will forgive them all their previous sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another virtue is that Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; answers your saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> because it means ‘O Allaah answer \ respond.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third virtue is what the Messenger  mentioned in his saying: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is incumbent upon us, to ensure we say <em>Ameen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to what is mentioned with regard to the coinciding of saying <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam and those following him in prayer necessitates that those following are attentive in their prayer whilst following the Imam and the Imam’s recitation to ensure that he does not miss saying <em>Ameen</em> in the correct place. If he misses saying <em>Ameen</em> he loses great reward and recompense, which is mentioned in this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this summons the presence of the heart and humility of the soul and the body whilst in prayer behind the Imam, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to bring to attention that which is relevant to this discussion of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, which is, once one is aware of the meaning of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, (O Allaah answer or O Allaah). Some people, whilst the Imam reads <em>Qunoot</em> and Exalts Allaah, Praises Him –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; and glorifies Him, stop saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, replacing it by saying ‘<em>Subhanak’</em> (Glory be to You) or similar words. This clearly opposes the Sunnah as the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is sufficient for all supplication regardless of whether it is<em>Dua’</em> praising Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> or <em>Dua’</em> of asking from Him or declaring Allaah’s Majesty and Greatness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A child that is below the age of seven does not yet comprehend. This is why we were commanded to order our children to pray when they turn seven since before this age they do not possess the adequate level of comprehension. So the point at which he begins to comprehend things is the age of seven. After reaching this age, a child must be ordered to pray. This is based on the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>&#8220;Order your children to pray at seven (years of age), and beat them to it (if they fail to comply) at ten. And separate them in their beds.&#8221;</b>These are Islamic etiquettes that we are required to follow, and included amongst them is: Commanding the children to pray at the age of seven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ordering them to pray doesn&#8217;t mean that you just tell your child &#8220;Pray&#8221; and that&#8217;s it. The understanding that we derive from this command of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) of ordering our children to pray is that we should teach them <i>how</i> to pray. And if this is not so, then the act of you telling your child who is playing by the door: &#8220;Go to the masjid and pray&#8221; when you have not taught him how to purify himself or how to perform the prayer, does not remove the responsibility from your shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have only fulfilled your responsibility when you have taught him how to purify himself and then you tell him “Go pray.” In this circumstance, you have complied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people are inconsiderate when they bring to the masjid their children – aged seven or less – who are not in a state of purity and have no understanding of how to pray, and then place them in a row of prayer. This row is considered disconnected due to this child standing in it since he is not praying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following statement of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) applies to people who this:<b>“Whoever connects the row, then Allaah will connect him, and whoever cuts off the row, then Allaah cut him off.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You bring a child who does not comprehend the prayer to the masjid and put him to stand in the first row next to you behind the Imaam while the people remain silent out of courtesy. This child is not in prayer. Perhaps he may not even be in a state of purity, i.e. he may have impurities in his body! This is since you took him from the front of the house before teaching him how to purify himself and how to pray. This is incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is mandatory that you teach him at home how to purify himself and how to pray. Then you should teach him where to stand in the masjid. He should not stand in the front row. Rather, he should stand in the row where all the children are lined up. If a group of people congregate for prayer and they consist of two rows, then the children should stand in the second row, i.e. the last row, after the row of men. This is what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) instructed us to do. So we must abide by these etiquettes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when the child reaches ten years of age, and non-compliance and rebelliousness (against this order) arises in him, he should be hit for the purpose of disciplining and intimidating him until he prays and safeguards all of his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Children should be separated in their beds at this age also, i.e. each child must sleep by himself (in his own bed). This is the etiquette of Islaam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee [D. 1416H]<br />

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his explanation of Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab&#8217;s classical treatise <i>Shuroot-us-Salaat</i>, Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p><i>Istijmaar</i> is not to be done only in cases of emergency as some people think. Rather, a person can perform <i>Istijmaar </i>(using stones) even if there is water present and he doesn’t perform <i>Istinjaa </i>(i.e. use water). This is what the Companions would do during their lifetimes since water was not as abundant and available as it is today. But in spite of this, they would not burden themselves by searching for water. If a person (at their time) would relieve himself, he would clean himself with stones (<i>Istijmaar</i>) and suffice with that even if water was available. If he fulfills the conditions (of ablution), by removing the source of the impurity from his body, it is valid for him to go and pray. As for the traces and marks of the impurity, then this is pardonable.</p>
<p>The same goes for a person who steps on impurities with his shoes or socks and then rubs them on the floor until the source of the impurity is removed even though the traces of the impurity may remain. He may pray in his shoes and socks even though traces remain after having removed the source of the impurity, just like the one who does <i>Istijmaar</i>.</p>
<p>The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If one of you comes to the masjid, he should look at the bottom of his shoes. If he sees an impurity on them, he should rub them on the ground. Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.”</b></p>
<p>This is one of the acts of the Sunnah that has been abandoned today. In fact, it is one of the acts of the Sunnah that is fought against by many people. It is even considered a crime in some regions – Entering the masjid with sandals and shoes. If I were to go today and buy a pair of shoes from a store and then put them on and enter the masjid with them – this would be regarded as a crime and considered disrespect for the mosques and houses of Allaah. The Sunnah has become innovation and innovation has become Sunnah! Praying in shoes was something well established at the time of the Salaf – they would not differ over it.</p>
<p>In fact, everything that is found in the command (of the Prophet) should be observed by an individual. Thus, he should check if his shoes are clean upon entering the masjid, acting upon the hadeeth which we just mentioned: <b>“Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.”</b></p>
<p>If he takes his shoes off, he should place them between his legs, not in front of him or behind him nor to his right or left, so as to disturb the people around him. Rather he should place them between his legs, in between his feet. This is what has been reported in the Sunnah and this is what the Salaf of this ummah have followed. This aspect of the Sunnah continues to be practiced in some areas of this country (i.e. Saudi Arabia). However, in some of the other areas of the country as well as some regions abroad, the reaction towards this Sunnah is bad.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must emphasize here that praying in shoes is Sunnah, i.e. recommended. It is neither obligatory nor is it a condition or requirement for the validity of one’s prayer. So if this aspect of the Sunnah conflicts with another good that is found in some masaajid, or if opening the door to entering the masaajid with shoes on leads to squandering money, then this aspect of the Sunnah should be left off temporarily and restrictedly – to this confined place – until it is revived in other places that are similar to these masaajid.</p>
<p>The youth should not hasten to enter the masaajid with their shoes on for they will open the door for everyone to do so, and this will lead some people who are in a rush to enter the masjid before checking under their shoes. This will then lead to a squandering of the masjid’s carpet and we have been prohibited from squandering money.</p>
<p>Squandering money is forbidden while entering the masjid and praying with shoes on is recommended. So when there exists a conflict such as this, we should work to revive the Sunnah of praying in shoes in masaajid other than these – i.e. in masaajid that have remained in their pure original state with floors that are covered by dirt and sand – or in our homes, or in some open land when we go out on a journey or camping. There are many places.</p>
<p>This means that we should not wage war against the act of praying in shoes, nor should we go to the extremes of entering these carpeted masaajid with shoes on thus causing the money spent on them to be squandered. Rather, we should combine between these advantages and those ahaadeeth, and that is by reviving the Sunnah of praying in shoes in other than these types of masaajid.</p>
<p>There are many masaajid and many places (to pray with shoes on). So we must have a good and proper understanding of the Religion and bring together all of the texts. A person should not take one portion or one text or one hadeeth and leave off all of the other texts. Rather, he must always try to reconcile and bring together all of the texts, as much as he is able to.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten garlic should not come to our mosques</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1702.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten from this plant (i.e., garlic) should not approach us and should not offer Salat (prayer) along with us</span>.&#8221;<br />

The Excellence of waiting for As-Salat (The Prayer)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1061.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Everyone among you will be deemed to be occupied in Salat (prayer) constantly so long as Salat (the prayer) detains him (from worldly concerns), and nothing prevents him from returning to his family but Salat.</span>&#8221;<br />

Chapter 189<br />
The Excellence of Proceeding towards the Mosque Walking</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1053.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who goes to the mosque in the morning or in the evening, Allah prepares for him a place in Jannah whenever he goes to the mosque in the morning and returns from it in the evening</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1054.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who purifies (performs Wudu&#8217;) himself in his house and then walks to one of the houses of Allah (mosque) for performing an obligatory Salat, one step of his will wipe out his sins and another step will elevate his rank (in Jannah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1055.</b> Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: There was a man of the Ansar whose house was the farthest from the mosque. As far as I know, he never missed Salat (in congregation). It was said to him: &#8220;If you buy a donkey, you may ride upon it in the dark nights and in the hot days.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I do not like that my house should be situated close to the mosque. I desire that my walking towards the mosque and returning home be recorded to my credit.&#8221; Upon this the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has gathered all (rewards) for you</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1056.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: There were some plots of land lying vacant around the mosque. The people of Banu Salamah decided to move to this land and come nearer to the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard about it and said to them, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I have heard that you intend to move near the mosque</span>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah! We have decided to do that.&#8221; Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Banu Salamah! Stay in your houses, because your footprints (when you come to the mosque) will be recorded</span>.&#8221; He said this twice. They said: &#8220;We would not have liked it, had we moved near the mosque.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1057.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The person who will receive the highest reward for Salat (prayer) is the one who comes to perform it in the mosque from the farthest distance. And he who waits for Salat to perform it with the Imam (in congregation) will have a greater reward than the one who observes it alone and then goes to sleep</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1058.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Convey glad tidings to those who walk to the mosque in the darkness. For they will be given full light on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1059.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I not tell you something by which Allah effaces the sins and elevates the ranks (in Jannah).</span>&#8221; The Companions said: &#8220;Yes (please tell us), O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Performing the Wudu&#8217; properly in spite of difficult circumstances, walking with more paces to the mosque, and waiting for the next Salat (prayer) after a observing Salat; and that is Ar-Ribat, and that is Ar-Ribat</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1060.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you see a man frequenting the mosque, testify that he is a believer because Allah says: `Allah&#8217;s mosques are visited only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

Chapter 194<br />
The Excellence of Standing in the First Row (In Salat)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1082.</b> Jabir bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came out to us (once) and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Why do you not stand in rows as the angels do before their Rubb?</span>&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! how do the angels stand in rows before their Rubb?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They complete each row beginning with the first and filling all the gaps</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1083.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If people came to know the blessing of calling Adhan and the standing in the first row, they could do nothing but would draw lots to secure these privileges</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1084.</b>Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best of the men&#8217;s rows (in Salat) is the first row and the worst is the last; but the best of the woman&#8217;s row is the last and the worst of their rows is the first</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1085.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) perceived a tendency among his Companions to stand in the back rows, he said to them, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Come forward and be close to me and let those who come after you, follow your lead. If people continue to fall behind (i.e., in acquiring virtues), Allah puts them behind</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1086.</b> Abu Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to gently pat our shoulders when we were standing in rows at the time of Salat and say, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Keep (the rows) straight; do not differ from each other lest your hearts should suffer from discord. Let those of you who are mature and prudent be nearer to me, and then those who are next to them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1087.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Keep your rows straight (during Salat in congregation), for keeping the rows straight is part of the perfection of Salat</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1088.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Iqamah had been announced, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned his face towards us and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Make your rows straight and stand close together, for I can see you from behind my back</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1089.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Straighten your rows; otherwise, Allah will create dissension among you</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed us to keep our rows as straight as arrows. He continued stressing this until he realized that we had learnt it from him (<span style="color:#800000;">recognized its significance</span>). One day he came into the mosque and stood up. He was just about to say Takbir (Allah is  Greater) when he noticed a man whose chest was projected from the row, so he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O slaves of Allah, you must straighten your rows or Allah will certainly put your faces in opposite directions</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1090.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to pass between the rows from one end to the other, touching our chest and shoulders (i.e., arranging the rows) in line and saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not be out of line; otherwise your hearts will be in disagreement&#8221;. He would add, &#8220;Allah and His angels invoke blessings upon the first rows</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1091.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Arrange the rows in order, stand shoulder to shoulder, close the gaps, be accommodating to your brothers, and do not leave gaps for Satan. Whoever joins up a row, he will be joined to Allah (i.e., to the Mercy of Allah); and whoever cuts off a row, he will be cut off from Allah (i.e., from His Mercy)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1092.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Stand close together in your rows, keep nearer to one another, and put your necks in line, for by Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I see the Satan entering through the opening in the row like Al-hadhaf (i.e., a type of small black sheep found in Yemen)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1093.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Fill (complete) the first row, then the one next to it; and if there is any deficiency (incompleteness), it should be in the last row</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1094.</b>`Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah and His angels invoke blessings upon those who are on the right side of the rows</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1095</b>. Al-Bara&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever we performed Salat behind the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we liked to be on his right side so that his face might turn towards us (at the end of the Salat). One day, I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicating, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O my Rubb! Shield me from Your Torment on the Day when You will gather (or said, `resurrect&#8217;) Your slaves</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1096.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Let the Imam stand in the middle (so that those praying behind him should be standing both on his right and his left) and close the gaps</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 191<br />
The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1064.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Salat in congregation is twenty-seven times more meritorious than a Salat performed individually</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1065.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man&#8217;s Salat in congregation is twenty-five times more rewarding than his Salat at home or in his shop, and that is because when he performs his Wudu&#8217; properly and proceeds towards the mosque with the purpose of performing Salat in congregation, he does not take a step without being raised a degree (in rank) for it and having a sin remitted for it, till he enters the mosque. When he is performing Salat, the angels continue to invoke Blessings of Allah on him as long as he is in his place of worship in a state of Wudu&#8217;. They say: `O Allah! Have mercy on him! O Allah! Forgive him.&#8217; He is deemed to be engaged in Salat as long as he waits for it.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1066.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque</span>.&#8221; He, therefore, sought his permission to perform Salat (prayer) in his house. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you hear the Adhan (call to prayer)?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then directed him to respond to it.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1067.</b> `Abdullah bin Umm Maktum, the Mu&#8217;adhdhin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;There are many poisonous insects and wild beasts in Al-Madinah, and I am blind. Please grant me permission to perform Salat at home<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired whether he could hear the call: Hayya `alas-Salah; Hayya `alal-Falah (Come to the prayer, come to the salvation). When he replied in affirmative, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed him to come (to mosque) for prayer.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1068.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I sometimes thought of giving orders for firewood to be collected, then for proclaiming the Adhan for Salat. Then I would appoint an Imam to lead Salat, and then go to the houses of those who do not come to perform Salat in congregation, and set fire to their houses on them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1069.</b>Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow (<span style="color:#800000;">i.e., on the Day of  Requital</span>) as a Muslim, should take care and observe the Salat when the Adhan is announced for them. Allah has expounded to your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the ways of right guidance, and these (<span style="color:#800000;">the prayer</span>s) are part of the right guidance. If you have to perform Salat in your houses, as this man who stays away (<span style="color:#800000;">from the mosque</span>) and performs Salat in his house, you will abandon the Sunnah (practice) of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and the departure from the Sunnah of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) will lead you astray. I have seen the time when no one stayed behind except a well-known hypocrite. I also saw that a man was brought swaying (<span style="color:#800000;">on account of weakness</span>) between two men till he was set up in a row (<span style="color:#800000;">in the mosque</span>).<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1070.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If three men in a village or in the desert, make no arrangement for Salat in congregation, Satan must have certainly overcome them. So observe Salat in congregation, for the wolf eats up a solitary sheep that stays far from the flock</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

Chapter 93<br />
Excellence of Walking Solemnly (Towards the Mosque) to perform As-Salat (The<br />
Prayer) and other Religious Duties</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever honours the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly from the piety of the heart.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:32)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>704.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When the Iqamah are pronounced, do not come to it running, you should walk calmly with tranquillity to join the congregation. Then join in what you catch for and complete what you miss.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In Muslim it is added: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;For when one of you is walking for Salat, he is, in fact, engaged in Salat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>705.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while we were returning from `Arafat. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard behind him a loud noise of beating and of driving the camels forcibly. He pointed towards it with his whip and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people! Proceed calmly. No virtue lies in rushing.&#8221;</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 33:</p>
<h3 align="center">Retiring to a Mosque for Remembrance ofAllah (I&#8217;tikaf)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.033.242"></a>Volume 3, Book 33, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practise Itikaf in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice Itikaf after him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.&#8221; It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to (put) bend his head (out) to me while he was in Itikaf in the mosque during my monthly periods and I would comb and oil his hair.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to let his head in (the house) while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair. When in Itikaf he used not to enter the house except for a need.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar asked the Prophet &#8220;I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance to stay in Itikaf for one night in Al-Masjid al-Haram.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.&#8221; Hafsa asked the permission of &#8216;Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, &#8216;What is this?&#8221; He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, &#8220;Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, &#8220;She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; Both of them said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one&#8217;s body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 252:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, &#8220;Did you hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Once we were in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, &#8216;I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle should return for it.&#8217; The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 253:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle practiced Itikaf with him while she ad bleeding in between her periods and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces, and sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 254:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet&#8217;s wife):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint Huyai, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry up, for I shall accompany you,&#8221; (and her dwelling was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you).&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 255:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, &#8220;Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, &#8220;This is Safiya&#8221;). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam&#8217;s offspring as his blood circulates in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, &#8220;Did Safiya visit him at night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, at night.&#8221;)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We practiced Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us and said, &#8220;Whoever was m Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman from &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He was informed about it. He then said, &#8220;What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them.&#8221; So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 258:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram for one night.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221; So, he performed Itikaf for one night.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that &#8216;Umar had vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram. (A sub-narrator thinks that &#8216;Umar vowed to perform Itikaf for one night.) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 260:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to perform Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan for ten days, and when it was the year of his death, he stayed in Itikaf for twenty days.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 261:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman from &#8216;Aisha: Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned that he would practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to perform Itikaf and he permitted her. Hafsa asked &#8216;Aisha to take his permission for</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 262:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha during her menses used to comb and oil the hair of the Prophet while he used to be in Itikaf in the mosque. He would stretch out his head towards her while she was in her chamber.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against building Masjids over graves</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle">Fatwas of Ibn Baz :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was asked: Is it permissible to build a Masjid over the site of the People of the Cave? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, all praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article published in the third edition of the Islamic Sciences League magazine in the &#8220;Muslim News in a Month&#8221; section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Islamic Sciences League, in<span id="ContentParagraph"> The Hashemite Kingdom of <strong>Jordan</strong>, </span>intends to build a Masjid over the site of the cave recently discovered in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the village of Al-Rahib, </span>which is said to be the cave where <span id="ContentParagraph">the People of the Cave </span>mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an slept</span>.</span> End Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is my duty to advise for the sake of Allah and His servants, I thought it would be beneficial to say a word in the same magazine of the Islamic Sciences League published in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </span>I must <strong>admonish</strong> the league to give up the intention of building a Masjid over the site of this cave, mainly and solely for the reason that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">building Masjids over the graves and remains of the Prophets and righteous people is utterly forbidden by the Shari`ah (Islamic law) and that those who do so are cursed</span></strong>. This is because such an act <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>may lead to Shirk</strong></span> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">excessive veneration and over praising of the prophets and pious people</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality bears witness to the validity of the texts of the Shari`ah and proves that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and provides decisive proof of the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down to him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk, excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk</span>. One of the outstanding virtues of Shari`ah is to forbid building of Masjids over graves and to warn sternly against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Shaykhs,<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>(may Allah be merciful to them), narrated some Hadiths to this effect on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="MayAllahcursetheJewsandthe"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">`Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#339966;">He warned against what they did and had it not been for this, his grave would have been raised above the ground but he feared that it would be taken as a Masjid</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim that <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="UmSalamahandUmHabibah(may"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"> </span><span id="ContentParagraph" style="color:#339966;">Um Salamah and Um Habibah (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in which there were pictures. When they told the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this, he said, &#8216;When a pious person among these people died they built a place of worship over his grave and painted these pictures therein. They will be the worst of creation in the Sight of Allah</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in Sahih<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) five days before his death, stating: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="IstandfreeofblamebeforeAllah"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph"></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths in this regard. Imams of Muslim scholars from the four Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) and others have stated the prohibition of building Masjids over graves. They issued the sternest warning against doing so, urging Muslims to observe the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and advising this Ummah lest it should fall into the same excessiveness and veneration of the prophets and pious people the way its predecessors from the extremist<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Christians </span>and their like who deviated from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is incumbent upon the Islamic Sciences League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jordan </span>and Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah and the way of the righteous Imams, and to be cautious not to commit what Allah and His Messenger warned against. It is the only way that leads to people&#8217;s uprightness and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. <span style="color:#ff6600;">It should be noted that some people formed their opinions based on the misinterpretation of Allah&#8217;s Statement in the story<span id="ContentParagraph"> of the People of the Cave: </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 21" target="_blank" name="AndthusWemadetheircaseknown"></a>(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): “We verily shall build a place of worship over them.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is that Allah (Praised and Exalted be He) informed us about the rulers and prominent people who announced this statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He told their story not by of expressing content and agreement with what they said, but rather as a kind of dispraise and expressing abhorrence of their action</strong></span>. This is even indicated by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to whom this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) was revealed and was the most knowledgeable of its interpretation, for he forbade his Ummah from building Masjids over the graves and cursed and dispraised those who do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this had been permissible, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have strongly affirmed its prohibition to the extent of cursing those who did it, or describing them as the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This should be sufficient in pointing out the gravity implied in the matter and providing a convincing answer to those who seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if we supposed that building Masjids over graves was permissible for those who preceded us, still we are not permitted to follow their example because the Shari`ah (Islamic law) abrogates all previous laws, and our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Last of the Messengers and the Shari`ah revealed to him is comprehensive</strong>. He (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and as such, we are not permitted to disobey him. We must follow his example and adhere to his Sunnah and abandon what contradicts it regarding the previous Shari`ahs (Divine laws) and favorable customs followed by some people, because Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is perfect and comprehensive and no guidance is better than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the One Whom we invoke to grant all Muslims and us success and to keep us firm on the truth and help us adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) in words and deeds, whether manifested or hidden, and in all our daily affairs until we meet Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah is the All-Hearer, Ever-Near and Responsive. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by Shaykh Ubayd al Jabiree in Telelink for Sri Lanka:</p>
<div class="qa-faq-answer" style="color:#888888;">
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The original question was if the masjid has a qabr or a grave is it permissible to pray in it. So Shaykh Ubayd (hafidhahullah) he went on after praising Allaah and saying peace and blessings on the Messenger and his family and companions, he went on to say in regards to this question that there are basically two situations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The first of them is that, if the grave came before the masjid, and the masjid was built because of the grave being there and was built so that the people would worship the person who was in that grave, worshipping besides Allaah.  And the Shaykh goes on to mention that there is a severe threat in regards to this affair. And he went on to mention some of the nusoos, some of the texts in regards to that, like the saying of the Messenger (sallalhualahi wa sallam) that the anger of Allaah is upon the people who take the graves of the Prophets as masaajids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And in another narration, that the Prophet (sallalhualahi wa sallam) asked for curse of Allaah to be upon the Jews and Christians, because they took the graves of their Prophets as Masaajids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So the Shaykh went on to say that there are many hadith on this issue. So he  said in regards to this, that it is not allowed to pray in it, because this masjid was built, because of the grave, because it was built, to worship other than Allaah. So the Shaykh said in this situation, then it is not allowed to pray in the masjid.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->Then the Shaykh mentioned a second situation and that is, if the masjid is built and the grave is built inside the masjid intentionally.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->So the Shaykh went on to mention that there are two things that can be done in this case.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->Then one of them, that a wall or separation is built to separate the grave from the masjid; or the second situation that the grave is taken out of the masjid and the person who was in the grave and buried along with the other Muslims.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->So then the Shaykh was asked, what is the case if the grave remains inside and not separate from the masjid, then the Shaykh said then it is not allowed to pray in it. It is not allowed to pray in this masjid.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;If one of you comes to the masjid, he should look at the bottom of his shoes. If he sees any impurity on them, he should rub them on the ground. Then he may enter with them (i.e, the shoes) and pray with them on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the acts of the Sunnah that has been abandoned today. in fact, it is one of the acts of the Sunnah that is fought against by many people. It is even considered a crime in some regions — Entering the masjid with sandals and shoes. If I were to go today and buy a pair of shoes from a store and then put them on and enter the masjid with them -this would be regarded as a crime and considered disrespectful to the mosques and houses of Allaah. The Sunnah has become innovation and innovation has become Sunnah! Praying in shoes was something well established at the time of the Salaf &#8211; they would not differ over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, everything found in this command (of the Prophet) Should be observed by an individual. So he should check if his shoes are clean upon entering the masjid, acting upon the hadeeth which we just mentioned: &#8220;Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he takes his shoes off, <strong>he should place them between his legs, not in front of him or behind him nor to his right or left</strong>, so as to disturb the people around him. Rather he should place them between his legs, in between his feet. This is what has been reported in the Sunnah and this is what the Salaf of this ummah have followed. This aspect of the Sunnah continues to be practiced in some areas of this country (i.e. Saudi Arabia). However, in some of the other areas of the country as well as some regions abroad, the reaction towards this Sunnah is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, <strong>we must emphasize here that praying in shoes is Sunnah, i.e. recommended. It is neither obligatory nor is it a condition or requirement for the validity of one&#8217;s prayer.</strong> So if this aspect of the Sunnah conflicts with another good that is found in some masaajid, or if opening the door to entering the masaajid with shoes on leads to squandering money, then this aspect of the Sunnah should be left off temporarily and restrictedly &#8211; to this confined area &#8211; until it is revived in other places similar to these masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth should not hasten to enter the masaajid with their shoes on for they will open the door for everyone to do so, and this will lead some people who are in a rush to enter the masjid before checking under their shoes. This will then lead to a squandering of the masjid&#8217;s carpet and we have been prohibited from squandering money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Squandering money is forbidden while entering the masjid and Praying with shoes on is recommended. So when there exists a conflict such as this, we should work to revive the Sunnah of praying in shoes in masaajid other than these &#8211; i.e. in masaajid that have remained in their pure original state with floors that are covered by dirt and sand &#8211; or in our homes, or in some open land when we go out on a journey or camping. There are many places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that we should not fight against the act of praying in shoes, nor should we go to the extreme of entering these carpeted masaajid with shoes on thus causing the money spent on them to be squandered. Rather, we should combine between these advantages and those ahaadeeth, and that is by reviving the Sunnah of praying in shoes in other than these types of masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many masaajid and many places (to pray with shoes on). So we must have a good and proper understanding of the Religion and bring together all of the texts. A person should not take one portion or one text or one hadeeth and leave off all of the other texts. Rather, he must always try to reconcile and bring together all of the texts, as much as he is able to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
Source:Al-Asaalah Magazine: Issue 13-14 (Contained in the E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> What is the religious ruling concerning holding a second congregational prayer in the masjid?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> The scholars of Fiqh have differed with regard to the ruling on holding the second congregational prayer. However, before we mention the difference of opinion and clarify which is the most correct of them, we must first identify the type of congregation that they differ on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of disagreement is with regard to the congregation that is established in a masjid that has a regular employed Imaam and mu’adhin. As for the congregations that are established in any other place, be it in ones home, a masjid built on the road (i.e. musalla) or a store, then there is nothing that prevents one from having repeated congregations in those places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars who hold the opinion that it is disliked to have numerous congregations in the above type of masjid, the one that has a regular Imaam and a regular mu’adhin, derive their ruling from two evidences. The first is textual and comes from the Divine Legislator, while the other is theoretical and it is a contemplation of the narrations and the wisdom behind the prescription of the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual evidence, then they have investigated and found that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went throughout his life leading the people in congregational prayer in his masjid. Nevertheless, whenever any individual from his Companions entered the masjid and found that the congregational prayer had finished, he would pray alone and he would not wait (for others to come). Nor would he turn towards his left or right, as the people do today, looking for one or more people so that one of them can pray with them as an Imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf never used to do any of this. So when one of them would enter the masjid and find that the people had prayed, he would pray by himself. This is what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee concluded in his book <i>Al-Umm</i>, and his discussion on this topic is from the moist comprehensive of talks that I have seen from the discussions of the Imaams on this issue, such that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a group of people enter a masjid and find that the Imaam has already prayed, then they should pray individually. But if they pray in a congregation, then their prayer is acceptable and correct, however, I hate that they do this for it was not from the customs of the Salaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;As for the masjid that is on the highway, which doesn&#8217;t have a regular employed Imaam and mu&#8217;adhin, then there is no harm in holding numerous congregational prayers in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;And we have memorized that a group from the Prophet&#8217;s Companions missed the congregational prayer, so they prayed individually. Even though they had the ability to congregate and pray together a second time, they did not do this because they hated to hold the (same) congregational prayer in the masjid twice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee. And what he mentioned that the Companions used to pray individually when they would miss the congregational prayer, has been mentioned as a ta&#8217;leeq narration in shortened form. And Al-Haafidh Abu Bakr Ibn Abee Shaybah transferred that to his famous book <i>Al-Musannaf</i>. He reported it with a strong chain of narration on the authority of Al-Hasan Al-Basree that when the Companions would miss prayer in congregation, they would pray individually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qaasim related this understanding in his <i>Mudawwanat-ul-Imaam Maalik</i> on a group of the Salaf, such as Naafi&#8217; the servant of Ibn &#8216;Umar, Saalim Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah and others, that when they would miss the prayer, they would pray individually and they would not establish the congregation a second time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Imaam At-Tabaraanee reported in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam Al-Kabeer</i> with a good chain of narration from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood that he went out one day with two of his companions from his house to the masjid in order to pray in the congregation. But when they got there, they found the people leaving the masjid for they had finished the prayer. So he returned to his home and led them in prayer. So this returning of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; being who he was due to his accompaniment of the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his knowledge and understanding of Islaam &#8211; if he knew the prescription of praying numerous congregations in one masjid, he would have entered with his two companions and prayed in congregation with them. This is since he knew the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;The best prayer of a man is the one he performs in his house, except for the obligatory prayer.&#8221;</b> So what was it that prevented Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) from praying this obligatory prayer in the masjid? &#8211; his knowledge that if he prayed it in the masjid, he would have to pray it alone. So he held that if he congregated in his home that would be better than if he and those with him prayed individually by themselves in the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a collection of the quotes that support the point of view of the majority of the scholars that have disliked numerous congregations held in the described masjid in the manner mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, people will not miss finding other evidences, while doing some deduction and precise investigation. Thus, the two Imaams, Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, have reported from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, <b>&#8220;I felt a strong desire to command a man to lead the people in prayer. Then command some men to fetch firewood, then go to the people who have left off praying in congregation and set their houses on fire. By the One in whose hand the soul of Muhammad is, if one of them knew that he would find two good hunted game in the masjid, he would surely come to witness the two.&#8221;</b> In this hadeeth, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) threatened those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer in the masjid with burning them with fire. I believe that this hadeeth alone informs us of the previously mentioned ruling or it informs us of what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee has stated and what Ibn Abee Shaybah has related. And that was that the Companions would not repeat the prayer in congregation in the masjid. This is since, if we were to assume that the second and third congregations were legislated in the masjid, then there came this severe threat from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to those who refrained from the congregational prayer, which congregation is it that they are refraining from? And for which congregation that they refrained from attending was this severe threat intended?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said: &#8220;For the first congregation&#8221;, then it must said: These other congregations are not legislated. And if it is said: &#8220;This severe threat only applies to the one who refrains from every congregation, however many even if their number is continuous. So then in this case, the argument of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) against anyone of those people who refrained from any of the congregations would not be established at all. This is since if he were to surprise one of them, after having put someone in charge to lead the prayer, by going to his house and finding him spending leisure time with his wife and children. And so he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would reprimand him for this, saying: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go pray in congregation?&#8221; He would simply reply to him: &#8220;I will pray with the second or third congregation.&#8221; So will the Messenger&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) argument be established against him? Due to this, the Messenger&#8217;s strong desire to authorize someone to take his place and for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to surprise those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer and burn their houses down, is the greatest proof that there is no second congregation at all. This is with respect to the textual reports that the scholars have relied on for support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the investigation, then it is from the following angle: There are many ahaadeeth reported that state the virtue of the prayer in congregation. From them is the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Prayer in congregation is better than praying alone by twenty-five &#8211; and in one report &#8211; by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So this great virtue was only stated for the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is stated in other ahaadeeth that: <b>&#8220;The prayer of a man along with another man is more purer in the sight of Allaah, than his praying alone. And the prayer of a man along with two other men is purer in the sight of Allaah than his praying with one man.&#8221;</b> This is because every time the congregation increases in its number of individuals, its reward multiplies with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we keep this understanding in mind and then look at the consequences of the opinion that allows the holding of numerous congregations in the masjid that has a regular Imaam, then it has the worst consequences. This is because the opinion for holding repetitive congregations will lead to the minimizing of the amount of people who attend the first congregation. And this contradicts the incitement that we find in the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;The prayer of one man along with another man is purer that his praying alone&#8221;</b> since this hadeeth encourages that there be many people in the congregation. And holding the opinion that the congregations can be repeated in the masjid, by necessity, leads towards a minimization of the amount of people in the prescribed first congregation and a division of the Muslims&#8217; unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is something else that requires careful examination. And it is that we must remember that the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) in Saheeh Muslim, similar to the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa): <b>&#8220;I strongly desired to command a man and so he would lead the people in prayer.&#8221;</b> It was stated with respect to those who refrained from performing the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. So when we know that Ibn Mas’ood (raa) placed a threat, of a specific type, on every person that refrains from attending the Jumu’ah and the congregational prayer, then we realize that these two prayers are with regard to their link to the congregation. For indeed, this threat means that there is to be no second congregation after any of these two prayers. Thus, the Jumu’ah prayer &#8211; until now &#8211; is preserved in its singularity and there is no opinion held stating that it is prescribed to have numerous (Jumu’ah) prayers in one masjid. All of the scholars, in spite of their differences agree on this. Due to this, we can see the masjids crowded with people on the day of Jumu’ah. And if it doesn’t escape out minds, we must remember that from the causes of the masjids being filled on the day of Jumu’ah is that there are those who attend Jumu’ah yet do not attend any of the other (regular) prayers. However, there is no doubt that the cause for the masjids being filled with people on the day of Jumu’ah is that the Muslims do not practice &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; the act of repeating the Jumu’ah prayer (continuously) in the same masjid. So if the Muslims were to treat the congregational prayer like they treat the Jumu’ah prayer and like the way the matter was during the time of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), the masjids would be filled with people. This is since every person that constantly prays in congregation will always have in his mind that if he misses the first congregation, he will not be able to attain it after that. So this belief will serve as an incentive for him to closely guard his attending of the congregational prayer. And the opposite is true also. If a Muslim holds inside that if he misses this first congregation, then he can always find a second one or a third one or sometimes even a tenth one, then this is from the things that weaken his enthusiasm and aspiration in attending the first congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two things that remain before us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First we must clarify that those who held the view that the second congregation, according to the particularization mentioned previously, was not legislated, and who said that doing it was disliked, they are the majority of the Imaams of the Salaf. Amongst them are the three Imaams &#8211; Abu Haneefah, Maalik and Ash-Shaafi’ee. Imaam Ahmad is also amongst them according to one report. However, this report is not well known amongst his followers today, even though one of his most specialized students, Abu Dawood As-Sijistaanee mentioned it. Thus, he reported from him in his book <i>Masaa’il Al-Imaam Ahmad</i> that he (Ahmad) said: &#8220;Repeating the congregational prayer in the two sacred masjids (i.e. of Makkah and Madinah) bears the highest level of disapproval (<i>kiraaha</i>).&#8221; So this, from the aspect of preference, indicates to us that there also exists the disapproval of repeating the congregations in other masjids as well. However, it (the level of disapproval) is more severe in the two (sacred) masjids. So in this report, Imaam Ahmad is in conformity with the other three Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, the other report on Imaam Ahmad &#8211; the one which is more known to his students &#8211; he (rahimahullaah) and those interpreters who followed him, base their support for it on a hadeeth reported by At-Tirmidhee, Imaam Ahmad and others. It is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree, in which he said: <b>&#8220;A man entered the masjid when the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) had already prayed and his Companions were gathered around him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This man wanted to pray, so the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: ‘Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?’ So a man stood up and prayed with him.&#8221;</b> And in the report of Abu Bakr Al-Baihaqee, which is found in his Sunan Al-Kubraa, it is stated that this man was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq. However, this report has weakness in its chain. The report that is authentic doesn’t name the man in it. So these (scholars) have used this hadeeth as evidence and say: &#8220;The Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of the second congregation!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response to the use of this evidence is that we must consider that the congregation, which the hadeeth talks about, is not the same congregation that is being indicated in the question. This is since the congregation that the hadeeth refers to the congregation of a man who enters the masjid after the first congregation has finished and wants to pray alone. But the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) incited those of his Companions who had prayed with him already to let one of them get up and volunteer and pray a voluntary prayer. So someone did it and that is the way it occurred. So this congregation consists of two people: The one leading the prayer (imaam) and the one being led (ma’moom). The Imaam is praying his obligatory prayer, while the ma’moom is praying a voluntary prayer. So who is the one who put this congregation together? If it were not for the one praying voluntarily, there would be no congregation. So therefore, this is a supererogatory and voluntary congregation, and not an obligatory congregation. And the differing (mentioned in the question) is only with regard to the second obligatory congregation. So due to this, using the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree as evidence for this area of dispute is not correct. And what further confirms this is the fact that the hadeeth states: <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?&#8221;</b> In this incident that occurred, there was someone who gave charity and there was someone who received charity. So if we were to ask a person with the least amount of knowledge and understanding: &#8220;Who is the one giving the charity and who is the one receiving the charity in this situation, which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of?&#8221; The answer would be: &#8220;The one giving the charity is the person praying the voluntary prayer, who had already prayed the obligatory prayer behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), while the one who is receiving the charity is the person who arrived late.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now if we were to throw this same question on the congregation that is in dispute right now: for example six or seven people enter the masjid, and find that the Imaam has already prayed. So one of them leads the prayer and the rest follow him in a second congregation. So who is the one giving the charity amongst these people? And who is the one receiving the charity? No one can give the same answer as in the first example. So this congregation (of people) that has entered after the Imaam finished praying, all of them are praying their obligatory prayer. There is no one giving charity, nor is there anyone receiving charity. On the contrary, this obscurity is quite obvious and clear in the first example. The one giving charity is the person who is praying the voluntary prayer, who already prayed behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). His prayer was recorded as twenty-seven levels (of reward). So because of that, he is rich and therefore able to give away in charity to others. And the one who leads the prayer &#8211; and if it were not for that person giving charity, he would have prayed alone &#8211; he is poor and in need for someone to give him charity. This is since he did not earn what the person who is giving him charity earned (from reward).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason for this person being the one giving the charity and that person being the one receiving the charity is clear. As for the scenario that is in dispute now, then the scenario is not clear, for all of the people (praying) are poor, since they have all missed out on the virtue of the first congregation. So the saying of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him&#8221;</b> doesn’t apply here. Therefore, in a situation like this, it is not valid to use this incident (mentioned in the hadeeth) as evidence. Nor can it be used in reference to this issue, which is the area of our discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will link this to another evidence they use as proof, which is the Prophet’s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Praying in the congregation is more virtuous than praying alone by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So they use the generality (in the hadeeth) as evidence, meaning they understand that the word &#8220;the&#8221; before the word congregation is for a general inclusion (of all congregations). This means that (according to them) every congregational prayer is more virtuous than praying alone. We respond by saying, basing it on the previously mentioned evidences that &#8220;the&#8221; is not for a general inclusion, but rather it is for a specific designation. This means that the congregational prayer &#8211; which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prescribed, incited towards, ordered the people to attend, threatened those who abandoned it with burning their houses and which those who abandoned it were described as being hypocrites &#8211; is the prayer in congregation that is more virtuous than praying alone. And it is the first congregational prayer. And Allaah, the Most High, knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know &#8211; may Allah have mercy upon you &#8211; that when the slave [of Allah] leaves his house to go to the mosque, that he is going to face Allah, the Irresistible, the One, the Omnipotent, the Exalted in Might, the Oft-forgiving, in the knowledge that nothing is hidden from Allah, wherever it might be, and that nothing is hidden from Allah and that even something as small as a mustard seed is not concealed from Him, nor even something smaller, nor larger &#8211; in the seven earths or the seven heavens, in the seven seas or the lofty mountains, fixed and firm. And  verily, the mosque to which he comes is one of the Houses of Allah. He desires only Allah and he sets out to one of Allah&#8217;s Houses, which:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">In houses (mosques), which Allah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honored), in them His Name is glorified in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings, Men whom neither trade nor sale diverts them from the Remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue), nor from performing As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), nor from giving the Zakat. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (from the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;an 24:36-37, Muhsin Khan Translation]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when anyone from amongst you sets out from his house (for the mosque) he should say quietly to himself words of remembrance [of Allah] &#8211; words unconnected with the affairs and business of this world. He should set out calmly, somberly, for this is what the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, ordered us to do; he should set out with (his heart full of) longing and desire [for Allah&#8217;s pleasure] and fear and apprehension [of Allah&#8217;s anger] and with humility and meekness towards Allah. For the more humble, the more meek, the more submissive he is to Allah, the more virtuous and righteous does he become in Salah and the greater becomes his reward, and the more noble and nearer to Allah becomes the worshipper. <span style="line-height:1.5;">But should he be filled with pride, Allah will destroy him and will reject his deeds, for the deeds of the proud are never accepted. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">It has been narrated in a hadith concerning Prophet Ibrahim, `alaihis salam, Allah&#8217;s Khalil, that he spent the night in worship and remembrance of Allah, and in the morning, he was pleased with the night&#8217;s worship and he said: &#8220;How Good is the Rabb (Lord), and how good is the slave, Ibrahim (`alaihis salam).&#8221; On the following day, finding none to share his food with him &#8211; and he loved to share his food &#8211; he took his food outside to the road and sat, waiting for any passerby to eat with him. then two angels descended from the heavens and approached him.So he invited them to eat with him and they accepted. Then Ibrahim `alaihis salam suggested that they approach a nearby garden which contained a fresh water spring. They agreed to this and approached the garden, only to find that the spring had run underground, so there was no water. This was a severe blow to Ibrahim, `alaihis salam, and he was  embarrassed by what he had said (because there was no spring in evidence) and so the angels said to him: &#8220;Ask your Rabb to return the spring.&#8221; He did so, but the spring did not appear, and this was a great blow to him and so he said to the angels: &#8220;You ask Allah.&#8221; So one of them asked Him, and behold! The water returned, then the other supplicated Allah and the water flowed near to them. Then they informed him that his being impressed by his own standing in prayer the previous night had caused his supplication to be rejected.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So beware &#8211; may Allah have mercy on you &#8211; of pride, for no deed will be accepted if it is accompanied by pride. Be humble in your Salah. Should any of you stand in Salah before his Rabb, he should know Allah, in his heart by the great blessings which He bestows upon him and the abundant favour which He grants him, for Allah has honoured him with great goodness, but he has saddled himself with sins. Therefore it is incumbent upon him to be excessive in his humility and meekness towards Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Abu ad-Darda that he said, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">That may face be covered in dust for my Rabb (is most loved by me), &#8211; for that is the best kind of worship for Allah</span></strong>.&#8221; So let none of you fear the dust, nor find it distasteful to make sujud in it, for there is no doubt that every one of you comes from it (i.e. mankind was created from dust). Nor should any of you fear an excess of it, for verily, it is by this means that one attempts to attain freedom from slavery and salvation from the Hellfire &#8211; a fire before which the fixed lofty mountains which were placed as pegs (holding the earth) could not stand, nor the seven strong heavens, built one above another, which are placed as a well graded canopy over us, nor the earth, which was placed as a dwelling for us, nor the seven seas, of which none knows their depths or their size except the One Who created them. Then what about us, with our feeble bodies, our delicate bones, our flimsy skin? We seek refuge with Allah from the Fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So should any of you stand in Salah &#8211; may Allah have mercy on you &#8211; then let him be as if he sees Allah before him, for though he may not see Allah, verily, Allah sees him. It is narrated in a hadith that Allah&#8217;s Messenger, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, advised a man, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>&#8220;Fear Allah as though you see Him, for verily, though you may not see Him, He sees you.&#8221; </em></strong></span>[Something similar to this wording is quoted in the hadith in which the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam spoke to Jibril, `alaihis salam, informing him about the meaning of ihsan, as reported by Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This then, is the advice of the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, to the slave in all his affairs, so what about when he performs Salah, when he stands before Allah, in a particular place, a sacred place, desiring Allah and turning his face towards Him? Does not his standing, his situation in Salah merit the same ihsan as all his affairs? It says in a hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>&#8220;Verily, the slave, when he starts his Salah, should turn his face to Allah, and he should not turn it away from Him until he leaves or turns to right and left.&#8221;</em></strong></span> [That is, when he makes taslim at the end of the prayer.] (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and an-Nasa&#8217;i).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated in a hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<em>Verily, the slave, as long as he is in Salah, possesses three qualities: Blessings are showered upon his head from the heavens above, the angels sit around him, from his feet to the heavens and a caller says: &#8216;If the slave knew the One Who hears his whispered utterances, he would never leave his Salah.'&#8221;</em></span></strong> [This narration was mentioned by Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Mirwazi in Kitab as-Salah from the hadith of Al-Hasan Al-Basri in a mursal form (an incomplete chain of narrations, in which no Companion is mentioned).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah showers His Mercy upon the worshipper who approaches prayer  in a state of humility and meekness towards Allah, in fear and supplicating Him with desire (for His Pleasure), and in hope (of His Mercy), making Salah to his Rabb, his most important consideration, dedicating his whispered utterances to Him and his standing erect in worship and his ruku` and his sujud, poring out his heart and his feelings and struggling to perfect his acts of worship, for he knows not whether he will perform another prayer after it, or whether he will be overtaken (by death) before he can perform Salah again. He stands before his Rabb, earnestly, with deep feelings, hoping for its acceptance and fearing its rejection, for verily, its acceptance is a cause for joy, while its rejection is a cause for misery and wretchedness. Nothing could be more important to you &#8211; O my brother &#8211; in this Salah, or indeed in any of your actions [i.e. that Allah should accept them]. What is more deserving of your distress and misery, your fear &#8211; indeed your terror &#8211; you know not whether your Salah will find favour with Allah at all, nor whether any of your good deeds will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know if your sins will be forgiven at all? After all this, you have no assurance that you will be spared from it (i.e. the punishment of the Hellfire). So who is more deserving of your tears and sadness [than Allah] &#8211; that He may accept from you (your deeds)? In addition to this, you know not whether or not you will awaken in the morning, nor if you will still be here in the evening &#8211; will you be given the good news of Paradise, or the bad news of the Hellfire? I only desire to warn you &#8211; O my brother &#8211; of this terrible danger. It is not fitting that you should be happy because of your family, your wealth or your children. It is a most amazing thing that you should continue to be unmindful, chasing after vain desires, wasting your time in disregard of this most important matter, for you are being driven at a fierce pace (towards death) day and night, hour by hour, like the blink of an eye. You should expect &#8211; O my brother &#8211; that your time may come at any moment and do not be unmindful of this great danger which may visit you. Most assuredly, you must (eventually) taste death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your time may come in the morning or in the evening. You will be separated from all that you possessed &#8211; either (to be rewarded with) Paradise or (to be punished in) the Hellfire. Descriptions and stories of them (have become) superfluous. Have you not heard &#8211; O my brother the words of the pious slave: &#8220;I am amazed concerning the Hellfire &#8211; how does the one who could flee from it sleep? And I am amazed concerning the Jannah &#8211; how does the one who desires it sleep? For by Allah! If you neither desire Paradise, nor fear the Hellfire, then you are destroyed and grievous will be your sorrow, interminable your sadness and without limit your tears; you will be amongst the wretched, the punished ones. So if you claim that you are amongst those who seek refuge from the Fire and desire Paradise, then strive for that which you seek and do not be misled by your worldly desires.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Pulling someone back from the complete row to avoid praying alone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If you enter the masjid and the first row of prayer is complete, can you pull someone from it behind so that he can pray with you (in the second row) or should you just pray by yourself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hadeeth about pulling someone back from the first row so that one would not pray alone in the second row were authentic, it would be obligatory to base the opinion on it. However, its chain of narration is not authentic, as I have explained in <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> and <em>As-Silsilah Ad- Da&#8217;eefah</em> (second volume).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore so long as this hadeeth is not authentic, then the person who enters the masjid and the row of prayer in front of him is complete, he must try to squeeze into the row that is before him. This is possible in most cases, during this era in which a majority of Muslims have abandoned the act of joining tightly (by squeezing together) in the lines of prayer, for many of them do not stand close together in the lines of prayer. So if he finds that the row is complete, he should try his best to find an empty space in it, even if he has to gesture to the one he wants to pray next to, to make some space for him to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he is not able to do this, either because the people in the row are closely packed together or because some of the people praying do not make room for him, then he could stand in the second row by himself, and his prayer will be valid. This is because the Prophet&#8217;s saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays in the row by himself</span>&#8221; is only in reference to the extent of one’s ability and adequacy to perform all the rest of the acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know, for example, that standing for the obligatory prayer is a pillar (of the prayer). Therefore, if one prays sitting while he has the ability to stand, his prayer is not valid. However, if he is not able to stand, then he could pray sitting, as the Prophet, <em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Pray standing. But if you are not able to, then sitting. But if you are not able to, then on your bed.</span>&#8221; This goes the same for the case of the individual who prays behind the row by himself, in that his condition is that he is not able to join into the row that is before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeeth, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays alone behind the row</span>&#8220;, is most likely applicable to the person that takes this issue lightly or to the one who turns away from this legal ruling. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As has been done by many people, especially those <em>mu&#8217;addhins</em> who do not join into the rows, but rather pray by themselves in places near to the door (of the masjid). So these individuals are the ones whom the hadeeth is directed to</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the man who enters the masjid and tries to join into the row but is not able to, nor does anyone come that will join him (in the second row), then he can pray by himself. And Allaah does not burden a soul with a responsibility, except that He has given it the ability to fulfill the responsibility. And this is the view of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The talk, Manners &amp; Ettiquetes that Every Muslim Should Display in the Masaajid (plural of masjid), was taken from a lecture given by our noble Sheikh, Abdur-Razaaq ibn Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad al-Badr, may Allah preserve both of them.</p>
</header>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasallam, informed us that,<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The most beloved places to Allah on earth are the masaajid, and the most hated places to Allah on earth are the markets.</span></em>&#8221; (Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits our sheikh has given is from this hadith is that the masaajid are distinguished for the acts of worship performed in them and the goodness they contain; the dhikr of Allah, salah, recitation of the Quran, spreading of the knowledge of the religion&#8230; just to name a few.  And the masaajid are places of sakeenah (tranquility).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the market places are totally different.  There people deal with each other in bad ways, often you may find evil transactions taking place, and more than that.  Also the markets are a place of noise, rushing and running.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this talk, we cover the <strong>14 points of ettiquete regarding attending the masjid</strong>.<br />
Did you know that some of them take place even before you leave your home?<br />
So what are the manners and ettiquetes that are upon us to display in these beloved places?  Listen to find out more.</p>

<p>Q: Please inform us about the ruling on interlacing the hands in the Masjid (mosque).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">It is Makruh (reprehensible) for the Muslims to interlace their <strong>fingers</strong> when they <strong>go and wait for Salah (Prayer)</strong> and <strong>during Salah</strong> itself</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported about the Prophet (peace be upon him) that this act is Makruh. When people go to Salah, it means that they are regarded as if they are in Prayer. Thus, they should not interlace their fingers. Also, they should not do that in the Masjid waiting for Salah or during Salah itself, as this act is Makruh. After offering the Salah, there is nothing wrong with doing that even if they are still in the Masjid. It is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that when he offered Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer), he regarded Salah as completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he sat in the front of the Masjid and interlaced his fingers (peace be upon him). Thus, there is nothing wrong with interlacing the fingers after offering the Salah even if in the Masjid.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Is it permissible for one who has missed something from the Prayer to stand up to complete what he has missed before the imaam completes the Salutation (<em>tasleem</em>)?”</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“That is not permissible for him. It is upon him to remain until the imaam has completed the second Salutation. If he gets up before he has completed his Salutation, and he does not go back, then his Prayer becomes a Supererogatory (<em>nafl</em>) [Prayer], and it is upon him to repeat it; because it is obligatory upon one praying behind an imaam to remain along with his imaam until the Prayer of the imaam is completed.”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">[&#8216;Silsilatul-Hudaa wan-Noor&#8217; tape series of Shaikh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee &#8211; rahimahullaah.]<br />
TAPE NO. 329 (00:25:39), [ repeated on tape no.351 (00:44:16)] :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. “ O Shaikh, the hadeeth which occurs in Saheeh Muslim, where the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, with the meaning: &lt;&lt;The worst of the rows of the women is the first one, and the best of them is the last one.&gt;&gt; So now, is that ruling, as is indicated by what is apparent from the hadeeth, the same in the closed rooms which are set up for that. Meaning in this closed places, for the women are now totally apart from the men; and it is well known that when (the scholars) spoke in explanation of the hadeeth they mentioned that the underlying reason for the first rows being the worst of them is that they are the closest ones to the men, as mentioned by an-Nawawee..”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. ( “Yes?”)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q. “So does what is apparent from the hadeeth apply to these closed places now?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. “Upon my belief I am not able to answer this question, because I think that the questioner consents to this closing off being something legislated, whereas I do not hold that.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q. “Yes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. “Because this is an innovation (bid`ah). Locking the women away, or enclosing them (in rooms) in the mosques, especially in spacious mosques, on account of the corruption in society; and confining them to a room where the movements of the imaam will be hidden from them, so that they are sometimes liable to render their Prayer deficient, to the extent of its being null and void.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in my belief locking the women away, in rooms specific to them in the mosques, is just the same as the row being cut by having an elongated minbar. Both of these are newly introduced affairs. So it is obligatory upon us to return to what the first Salaf were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We discussed this matter at length yesterday. Yes, the brother was present with us..the brother was with us..)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said: The women today are different to the women of yesterday, and there can be added to that : this is something witnessed. So this saying results in the conclusion that it is therefore befitting that we should confine the women to these rooms, so that the men do not come across anything from that which should remain hidden from the women. So I gave a relatively long answer, and time was short, so I said, as part of a long discussion: that confining the women to these rooms is not a case of legislated masaalihul-mursalah (matters established for the welfare of the Muslims), since the reason for this confinement is a failing of the Islamic society- and it includes the women- to carry out legislated obligations. So if the women entered the mosques wearing the legislated jilbaab, then those who build these rooms would not have the idea entering their minds of confining the women to them. However when they witnessed, unfortunately, some women entering, some perhaps wearing a coat/jacket, or a &#8216;tunic&#8217;, or what they call a &#8216;jilbaab&#8217; today, and it is not a jilbaab, down to their mid calves, or sometimes wearing transparent flesh coloured tights, and so on. so the gaze of the men was liable to see something that should be hidden. So therefore they said: We will screen the women away from the men in the mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: No! It is rather upon us to implement Islaam, and that we return the Islamic society as a whole, not sections of it, to what was the practice in the initial time. So we contend with the society today. We want the Muslims to return: with their scholars, their students, and their common folk, to that which the Salaf were upon; not to (blind) following of madhhabs, but rather to &#8216;Allaah said.., His Messenger said&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will not be a prevention of having differenct views, just as there was at the beginning, but we do not want there to be restrictive (blind) following of madhhabs. We want the societies, the elite and the general folk, to return to what the Salaf were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As with the case of the mosques. We do not want there to be elongated minbars. We do not want there to be extended minbars in the form of trickery to escape legislated prohibitions (al- Hiyal ash-Shar`iyyah). They realized that the older minbars sever the rows (for the Prayer), so now they come out to us from a minbar which he enters via the mihraab, and he ascends and then appears to the people upon a little raised platform. Why all this twisting and turning? (All that is needed) is three steps, and Allaah has sufficed the Believers so that they have no need to fight. The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. How many dirhams and deenaars does it cost to enable the khateeb to ascend to this platform? Based upon the claim: &#8216;We do not want to sever the rows.&#8217; This claim is a good one. This is the case. However it can be attained without all of this unnecessary effort: take a minbar comprising three steps, and the problem is at an end. Likewise we do not want there to be all this decoration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And lastly we do not want these rooms for the women. We want for the women what we want for the men: that which was previously present: that the women enter wearing hijaab, and the men move forward to the front rows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in that case the previous hadeeth will apply: &lt;&lt;The best of the rows of the women is the last one, and the worst of them is the first one.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not want to reverse the indication of the hadeeth on account of the aberration that has appeared with the building of these rooms in the mosques.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the Masjid, (mosque) linguistically and religiously?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Linguistically, the masjid is the place of prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Religiously, it is everything that is built for the Muslims to offer the five prayers in congregation.<br />
It is also used to refer to that which is more general that this. Thus, it also includes that place that a person uses in his house(or has allocated) to offer the voluntary prayers in, or he uses it to perform the obligatory prayers when he is unable to offer them in the masjid where the people have established congregational prayer. From this is that which Al-Bukhari and others recorded from Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, who said that the messenger of Allah sallahu alayhi was sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I was given five (things) that no one was given before me. I was aided with Ar-Ru&#8217;b (fright cast into the hearts of enemies) for a month&#8217;s distance (of travel), and the earth was made a Masjid (place of prayer) for me and a means of purification. So any man from my nation (the Muslims) whom the (time for) prayer catches, then let him offer the prayer&#8230;.&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is much talk about Tahiyyatul-Masjid: Some say that it should not be done during the times when it is reported that prayer is forbidden, such as at the times of sunrise and sunset. Others say that it is permissible since the reasons for it are not restricted by any time and that it should be done even if half the sun had set. I request a detailed explanation of this.</p>
<p><span style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is some disagreement amongst the scholars in this matter, but the correct view is that Tahiyyatul-Masjid is lawful at all times, even after Fajr and after Asr based upon the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): <strong>If any of you enters the mosque, he should not sit until he has prayed two Rakahs</strong>. [1] Also, it is a prayer that there is a reason to perform, like Salat At-Tawaf [2] and Salat Al-Khusuf, [3] and the correct view in all of these is that they should be performed at all of the times when prayer is (normally) prohibited, just like making up for an obligatory prayer which one has missed, based upon the words of the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) regarding Salat At-Tawaf: <strong>O people of (the tribe of) Abdi Manaf! Do not prevent anyone from performing Tawaf of this House and praying anytime of the night or day that he wishes</strong>. [4] And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said, regarding Salat Al-Kusuf: <strong>Verily the sun and the moon are two Signs among the Signs of Allaah, they are not eclipsed for the death or the birth of any man, so if you see them, pray and supplicate, until what you are suffering is removed</strong>. [5] And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever slept through a prayer or forgot it, must make up for it as soon as he remembers it, and there is no expiation for it except this,</strong>. [6] All of these Hadiths extend to include the times when prayer is prohibited and other times. This saying is the preferred view of Shaikh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah and his student, the great scholar, Ibn Al-Qayyim &#8211; may Allaahs mercy be on both of them. And Allaah is the Granter of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Al-Bukhari no. 1163 and Muslim no. 714 [2] Salat At-Tawaf: A two rakah prayer following circumambulation of the Kabah during Hajj and Umrah. [3] Salat Al-Khusuf: Prayer of the lunar or solar eclipse. [4] Abu Dawud no. 1894, At-Tirmithi no. 868 and Ahmad 4:81 [5] Al-Bukhari no. 1040 and Muslim no. 901 [6] Al-Bukhari no. 597 and Muslim no. 684</p>
