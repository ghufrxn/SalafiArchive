<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">اِعْلَمْ <sup> </sup>رَحِمَكَ اللهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know! May Allaah have Mercy upon you</strong></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Know!”, it is a word which indicates giving importance to the topic, so when he said, “Know!”, then its meaning is that the matter which he is going to put before you is a matter which is important. So this word, “Know!”, indicates the importance of the topic which he is beginning it with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of, “<strong>Know</strong>!”, Is that it is a command from, ‘<strong>knowledge</strong>’, meaning, ‘<strong>learn</strong>!’. And knowledge means: to comprehend something as it actually is, or, to perceive something in accordance with how it actually is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To comprehend something in a manner which is contrary to how it actually is in reality, or to perceive something contrary to the reality of it, this is ignorance, and it is the opposite of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<em>May Allaah have Mercy upon you</em>”, this is a supplication for the seeker of knowledge, so the shaikh makes supplication for the student of knowledge, that Allaah has Mercy upon him, and that He the Perfect and Most High should place Mercy upon them. So this shows the kindness of the teacher towards the student, and that he should begin with good and fine speech, and with righteous supplication, so that this has an effect upon him and so that he turns attentively to his teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for if the teacher begins with stern words, and with speech which is not appropriate, then this will alienate (i.e. will cause the student to flee). So what is obligatory upon the teacher and upon whoever calls to Allaah and whoever commands the good and forbids the evil is to be kind and gentle with those he addresses with making supplication for him and complimenting him and speaking with mild speech, because this is more likely to bring about acceptance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obstinate opponent and the person who proudly refuses to accept, then there is a different way of addressing this person. Allaah the Perfect said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُجَادِلُوا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَقُولُوا آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَإِلَٰهُنَا وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ وَاحِدٌ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not debate with the People of the Book except in a manner which is best, except those of them who transgress. And say we truly believe in what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to you, and our Lord whom we worship and your Lord is One, and we are Muslims in submission to Him. </strong></span>[29:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who transgressed from the People of the Book and knowingly and obstinately refused the truth, and rejected the truth with pride, those people are not addressed in the manner which is finest, rather they are addressed with that which will deter them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ الْكُفَّارَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them. And their final abode is the Hell-fire, and what an evil destination</span>. </strong>[9:73]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites, they are not fought against with weapons, rather <em>jihaad</em> is waged against them with proof and speech and by refuting them with sternness as a deterrent for them, and in order to deter the rest of the people away from them. And He the Most High said with regard to them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَوْلًا بَلِيغًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And admonish them with a saying which will have an effect upon them.</span> </strong>[4:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a specific manner of addressing those people, because they are people who deliberately and obstinately reject, and reject from pride, and they do not want the truth, rather they want to misguide the people, so those people are addressed with that which befits them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the student who seeks guidance, then he should be spoken to with gentleness and mercy, and kindness, because he desires the truth, and he desires knowledge and he desires benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<em>Know! May Allaah have Mercy upon you</em>”, is a supplication for you for mercy, for if Allaah truly has Mercy upon you, then through that you will be blissful in this life and in the hereafter, if you enter within the Mercy of Allaah – and this is a supplication from a great scholar and a righteous man, so it is to be hoped that it will be accepted, if Allaah wishes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Ahmad was suffering from his final sickness, at times, he would feel pain and groan out loud. So when one of his students came and heard him, he narrated to him with a chain of narration from Muhammad bin Sireen that Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) used to consider it detested (<i>makrooh</i>) to groan. After that, he did not hear Ahmad groan again until he passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This mentality on the part of the student and the teacher is that which will enable the student of knowledge, through the Grace of Allaah, to become a scholar in the future, if Allaah wills. And this is the mentality which will enable him to benefit and cause him to always be preoccupied with knowledge – day and night, he is learning. <span style="color:#ff6600;">He should not look down upon a point of benefit that comes to him by way of someone that is young in age or old in age</span>. Some people receive points of benefit from individuals that are younger than them (in age and knowledge), and so they feel arrogant towards him or they don’t give that point their full attention. The reason for this is because they have elevated themselves over the knowledge. And when one elevates himself over knowledge, he will not be from those who are able to acquire it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, a younger or smaller person may have some knowledge that an older or bigger person doesn’t. And likewise one who is younger or smaller may understand some aspects of knowledge whereas one who is older and bigger may not. But if he explains it to him, he should benefit from it. The scholars have mentioned a clear example for this, which is the story of prophet Sulaymaan and the hoopoe bird. Even though the hoopoe bird was lowly in terms of stature and composure and Sulaymaan was elevated in terms of stature, composure and position in the sight of Allaah and before all of creation, the hoopoe bird said to him: <b>“I have grasped knowledge of something that you have not grasped. And I have come to you from Saba’ (Sheba) with certain news.”</b> [Surah An-Naml: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <strong>hoopoe</strong> bird knew something that Sulayman was unaware of. The people of knowledge have derived from this story that you should not be arrogant with someone that brings you a point of benefit (from knowledge), regardless if he is young and lowly or old and prominent.</p>

<p>من مجالس شيخنا ربيع العامرة بالنصح والتوجيه</p>
<p>كنت عنده يوم الأربعاء بتاريخ ٢١|٤|١٤٣٣ من هجرة</p>
<p>نبينا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم.<br />
وكان يتكلم على الغرور ويذمه ثم ذكر :<br />
《 عبد الله القصيمي 》<br />
قال : كان رجلا ذكيا جدا له كتابات قوية لو ثبت يمكن يمثل شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية في هذا العصر !<br />
لكنه ( الغرور ) الذي أضله ، فيه غرور شديد ، والله كنت أقرأ له والتمس الغرور في بعض كتاباته .<br />
ولما نصحه بعض العلماء تكبر للغرور الذي فيه وارتد عن الدين .انتهى<br />
كتبه : أبو حسان سمير القيسي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the sittings of Shaykh Rabee full of advice and guidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was with the shaykh on Wednesday 21/4/1433 AH and he was speaking about self delusion. He was dispraising it and he then made mention of <strong>&#8220;Abdullah Al-Qaseemi&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;This was an extremely intelligent man who had powerful writings. Had he remained firm, he could well have been like the Shaykh ul Islam ibn Taymiyyah of our times! However, self delusion _(alghuroor)_ is what caused him to stray. He was severely deluded by himself. By Allah, I would read his books and sense self delusion in some of his writings. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When some of the scholars advised him, he became haughty due to that very same delusion that he had (about himself) and thereafter he apostated and left the Religion.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by Hassaan Sameer Al-Qaysee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">I, Nadeem Ahsan-Shah received this from brother Rabee Al-Maqaalih of Madinah (via a whatsapp group) who confirmed to me that he heard this directly from brother Hassaan Sameer Al-Qaysee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abu Ishaaq Nadeem Ahsan-Shah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">May Allah keep us firm upon His Deen and protect us from feeling safe from the Hell-Fire.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong>Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).”</strong>[Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Murtaza bIn Bakhsh:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is upon the truth and who is upon falsehood? How will we know this and how will we be able to distinguish this? Is it possible without knowledge? Then, when will we seek knowledge? Is it not important that time be allocated? It is important; and knowledge is sought from the scholars. It is notjust sought from books. It is sought from scholars and students of knowledge. Those scholars who teach the Qur’aan and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf of this Ummah &#8211; this confinement is obligatory, that there is the Quraan, authentic Hadeeth and they speak, teach the religion and give rulings according to the understanding of the Sahaabah (companions of Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you find such a scholar or such a student of knowledge somewhere, then do not leave him; and connect with the scholars, the senior scholars all praise be to Allaah &#8211; such scholars are present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now (seeking) knowledge has become easy, translations have come forth &#8211; in English, in Urdu, in every language. Shaykh bin Baaz rahimahullaah, Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen, (the) Muhaddith, Muhammad Naasiruddeen aI-Albaani rahimahullaah, there are (about) 10,000 cassettes of his &#8211; now we have CDs, but before the CDs there were (about) 10,000 cassettes. And if you just take out any cassette from the middle, you will notice that they contained the lessons of Tawheed and the Manhaj of the Salaf, in each of his cassettes. Far removed is Allah from all imperfections!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan is alive [hafidhahullaah], Shaykh Saalih al-Luhaydaan is alive, Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree, Shaykh Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee aI-Madkhalee &#8211; they are those ‘Ulemaa, that if you attach yourself to them, by Allaah, life changes. There is light [of guidance] in their sayings; there is light in their guidance. If (you) want to learn the methodology of the Salaf, then this is the path, this is the methodology. There are other Salafee scholars as well but I remember these names, their names are known and famous. Do not say that I do not have a way to reach them. By Allaah, by sitting at home, nowadays, all praise be to Allaah, there are online duroos happening as well. Aren’t they happening? Use this technology correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People abuse it by listening to songs and what not. You use it correctly and see how you become a part of (seeking) beneficial knowledge and how it benefits you even after your death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Excellent Example</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>‘<strong>Aqeedah</strong></em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his <strong>worship</strong>, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam – </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character</strong> &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> as an example in their <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa’</em> will be successful <em>– InshAllaah –</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa’</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa’</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa’</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa’</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa’</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness – and the likes of these things – then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa’</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa’</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part I)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/527-530), in explanation of the saying of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa &#8211; :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Stones will soon fall upon you from the sky. I say: Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said…, and you say: Aboo Bakr and `Umar said!”</span> :-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…This saying from Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – was a response to those who said to him: &#8220;Aboo Bakr and `Umar &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhumaa – did not hold joining the `Umrah along with the Hajj (at-tamattu`), and they held that performing Hajj on its own (al-Ifraad) is better‟, or the like of that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, it was because of this that Ibn `Abbaas said, when they countered the Hadeeth with the opinion of Aboo Bakr and `Umar -: “Stones are about to fall upon you from the sky…” – the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee</strong> – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The scholars are agreed, by consensus, that whoever is such that the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) becomes clear to him, then it is not for him to leave it for the saying of anyone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam Maalik</strong> – rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is none of us except that he rebuts and is rebutted, except for the occupant of this grave (صلى الله عليه وسلم)”,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the speech of the imaams with this meaning is abundant…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…So the speech of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – shows that whoever receives a textual proof, and he does not accept it, because of taqleed (blind-following) of his imaam, then it is obligatory to criticize him severely, because of his opposing the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ahmad said: “Ahmad ibn `Umar al-Bazzaar narrated to us: Ziyaad ibn Ayyoob narrated to us: Aboo `Ubaydah al-Haddaad narrated to us: from Maalik ibn Deenaar: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is not one of us except that some of his sayings are taken, and some are left; except for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore it is obligatory to criticise whoever leaves the proof in favour of anyone from the scholars, no matter who that is. The recorded sayings of the imaams clearly state this; and state that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘taqleed’ (blind-following) is not allowable except in matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction) for which no proof is found in the Book or the Sunnah</strong></span>. So this is what some of the scholars meant by their saying: <em>‘There is to be no criticism in the matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction).’</em> As for the one who acts contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to refute him; just as was said by Ibn `Abbaas, ash-Shaafi`ee, Maalik, and Ahmad – and this is something agreed upon, as has preceded in the speech of Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part II)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/532), in explanation of the saying of Imaam Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity, and yet they hold on to the opinion of Sufyaan, whereas Allaah – the Most High – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So let those who oppose the Messenger‟s command beware, lest a fitnah (affliction) befalls him, or a painful torment be inflicted upon him</span>.[Sooratun-Noor (24):63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know what the affliction is? The affliction is <strong>Shirk</strong>. Perhaps if he rejects something from his saying, some deviation will fall into his heart and he is destroyed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the saying of Imaam Ahmad – rahimahullaah – “I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity…” is a criticism from him of that; and shows that it leads to deviation of the hearts, which causes a person to become a Disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">So this evil has become extremely widespread, particularly amongst those who claim attachment to knowledge. They do whatever they can to prevent people from acting upon the Book and the Sunnah; and they block people from following the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and from honouring and respecting his commands and prohibitions. So from that is their saying: &#8220;No one except a &#8220;mujtahid‟ can use the Book and the Sunnah as proof, and &#8220;ijtihaad‟ has ended‟, and the saying: &#8220;This person who I am blindly following knows better than you do about hadeeth, and about the abrogating and abrogated narrations‟, and the like of these sayings, whose goal is just the abandonment of following of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم): he who does not speak from his own desires, in favour of dependence upon sayings of those who can err, and who is contradicted by other imaams and whose saying can be nullified by a textual proof. So there is not an imaam except that he only possessed a portion of knowledge; he did not possess all of it. So what is obligatory upon every legally responsible person, when a proof from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches him, and he understands its meaning, is that he accepts it and acts upon it, no matter who contradicts it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and do not take others besides Him: obeying them in disobedience to Him. Little do you remember!</span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is it not sufficient for them that We sent down to you this Book which is recited to them?! In it there is mercy and a reminder for those who believe in it</span> [Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29):51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A statement of the consensus (ijmaa`) upon that has already preceded [1] , and an explanation that the blind-follower (muqallid) is not from the people of knowledge; and Aboo `Umar ibn `Abdil-Barr and others also report ijmaa` (consensus) upon that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Transl. Note: [i.e. from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And no one disagrees with this except for the ignorant ones from the blind-followers, because of their ignorance of the Book and the Sunnah, and because of their turning away from these two. So those people, even if they think that they are following the imaams, then in reality they have only contradicted them and followed other than their way. So we have already quoted the saying of Maalik, ash-Shaafi`ee, and Ahmad. <strong>However in the speech of Ahmad – rahimahullaah – there is an indication that &#8220;taqleed‟ (blind-following) before the proof reaches is not blameworthy; rather it is only criticised for one whom the proof has reached, and he opposes it in favour of the saying of one of the imaams.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this only comes about as a result of their turning away from seeking to understand the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger; and turning instead to the books of the later people, and sufficing with them to the exclusion of the two parts of Revelation. So this resembles what occurred with the People of the Book: those about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They took their scholars and monks as lords besides Allaah</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):31],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an explanation of which will follow in the hadeeth of `Adiyy ibn Haatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is binding upon the one who is sincere is that when he reads the books of the scholars, and examines them, and becomes aware of their sayings, that he submits them to what is found in the Book, and the Sunnah; for every mujtahid from the scholars, and those who follow him and ascribe themselves to his madhhab, must mention his evidence; and the truth in any matter is one; and the imaams are rewarded for their ijtihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the justly balanced person makes examination of their speech, and consideration of it a path to acquiring awareness of the different issues, and a means to bring them to mind, and a way to distinguish what is correct from what is incorrect – by means of the evidences which those who use the evidences mention; so that in this way he will become aware of which scholar was most fortunate in having the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the proofs for this fundamental principle are more than can be enumerated, in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah likewise….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the imaams – rahimahumullaah – did not fall short in clarifying this matter. Rather they forbade that they be followed blindly when the Sunnah becomes clear, because they knew that there were matters of knowledge unknown to them, and that this knowledge could reach others, and this occurs a great deal; and this will not be hidden from one who examines the sayings of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth comes from Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) then it is upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Companions – radiyallaahu `anhum – then upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Taabi`een, then we are men and they were men.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If I say a saying, and the Book of Allaah contradicts it, then abandon my saying in favour of the Book of Allaah.” It was said: &#8220;If the saying of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the narration of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). It was said: &#8220;If the saying of the Companions contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the saying of the Companions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ar-Rabee` said: I heard ash-Shaafi`ee – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you find in my book something contrary to the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), then take hold of the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and leave whatever I said.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth is authentic with something contrary to my saying, then throw my saying against the wall.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone is such that some of his sayings are taken and some are left, except for Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this has already been mentioned from him, so there is no excuse for a blind-follower (muqallid) after this… .”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-`Uthaymeen On ‘Taqleed’ (Blindfollowing)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;al-Qawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed‟ (2/152):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Some people commit a grievous mistake when it is said to them: &#8220;Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said‟, he says: &#8220;But in the book of so and so there occurs such and such.‟ So it is upon him to fear Allaah, Who said to him in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And the Day when Allaah will call to them, and say, &#8220;What response did you give to the Messengers?</span> [Sooratul-Qasas (28):65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say: &#8220;What response did you give to so and so?‟ As for the author of the book, then if it is known that he loves good, and intends good, then supplication for forgiveness and mercy is made for him if he errs. It is not to be said that he is infallible, and his saying used to contradict the saying of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Advice: Do not take Knowledge except from one who is known to be upon the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Sireen (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, this knowledge is Religion. So look into (i.e. investigate) whom you take your Religion from</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: <span style="color:#008000;">“They (the Sahaabah) did not used to ask concerning the isnaad (chain of narration), but when the fitnah occurred, they began saying: ‘Name your men for us.&#8217; So the People of the Sunnah would be looked to and so their hadeeth would be accepted. And the People of Innovation would be looked to and so their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one of these repentant individuals neglects these principles and guidelines, he becomes an open target for these misconceptions and he becomes a play object for many of those who (falsely) ascribe themselves to knowledge and Salafiyyah. So all it takes is for a person to claim knowledge or manifest his connection to the scholars from Ahlus-Sunnah, and you will find the repentant youth flocking around him, without thoroughly examining the reality of his condition and without looking into his history (i.e. background). But When he sees that his followers have become many and those who love him have become engrossed with him, he begins to reveal what he was concealing and what (way) he really inclined to. So now you see him calling to (holding) leadership in the field of Da&#8217;wah and pitching a tent for gathering everyone (i.e. regardless of beliefs). Or you see him doing other things that are in opposition to the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the point where the repentant individuals begin to become confused and divided into two or even three categories &#8211; those who agree, those who are against and those who are neutral. This confusion only comes about due to two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The repentant individual&#8217;s lack of devoting attention to beneficial knowledge, especially knowledge of the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah, since Knowledge protects the one who has it from deviations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did you not see how knowledge protected Abu Bakrah (rady Alllaahu &#8216;anhu) in the Campaign of the Camel (Jamal),[9] when the people put the Mother of the Believers, ‘Aa&#8217;ishah (rady Allaahu &#8216;anhaa) forth (for the campaign). So what protected Abu Bakrah (rady Allaahu anhu) was a hadeeth he heard from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, who said when news reached him of the death of Kisraa and the appointment of his daughter (as the leader): “A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman will never prosper.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So When the fitnah occurred, Abu Bakrah remembered this hadeeth and it protected him from that, such that he said: “Allaah protected me with something that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah When Kisraa died. He (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: Who did they put to succeed her?&#8217; They said: &#8216;Her daughter.&#8217; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman Will never prosper.&#8217; So when &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah approached, i.e. Basrah, I remembered the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and so Allaah protected me by it.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: A lack or returning to the People Of Knowledge, Since the most deserving to be asked are the People of Knowledge and their students from Ahlus-Sunnah wal- Jamaa&#8217;ah, those who have knowledge of this individual whom the people seek to study under. so this person Should be enquired into:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is he from the Salafee students of knowledge or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And did he undergo valid educational studies, Such that he has the right to be sought knowledge from or no?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SO if the answer is in the negative, then the issue comes to an end, all praise be to Allaah. And if the answer is positive, then he can be Studied under and benefited from, but without going to extremes in that matter. Rather, he should be given his due place and status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important point, which is: Differentiating between the enlightened Scholars, those Who are referred to in issues related to knowledge and current events, such as the two Imaams, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee and ‘AbduI-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz (rahimahumaAllaa) and those enlightened scholars Who remained after them, such as the Mashaayikh, Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen, Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, our Shaikh, Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee and others who are at their level amongst the people Of knowledge and fatwaa from AhlusSunnah waI-Jamaa&#8217;ah. So these individuals have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between the prominent students of knowledge, whose knowIedge is known and whose following of the Sunnah is apparent by way of their books and the commendations of the scholars for them. SO these individuals also have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between those who are less than them, from the students of knowledge, Whose Salafiyyah is Known and Whose ability to teach is recognized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] These last two narrations were reported by Imaam Muslim in his Introduction to his Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator&#8217;s Note: The Campaign of the Camel occurred after the murder of Uthmaan, radyAlllaahu &#8216;anhu. when there was much turmoil amongst the Muslims. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib radullaahu &#8216;anhu was given the bav&#8217;ah (oath of allegiance) as the succeeding Khaleefih and he decided to wait for the turmoil to simmer down before seeking revenge from the assassin of ‘Uthmaan. So the Muslims Were divided into those who were With him on this decision and those Who wanted justice for his murder right away. A group was formed to go and voice their case to ‘Alee and they rallied several of the Sahaabah including ‘Aa‘isha radhi Allaahu &#8216;anhaa‘ So she participated in the campaign riding on a camel (hence the name Jamal). When the parties at Basrah, a peaceful agreement was decided, yet due to some misunderstanding and confusion battle broke out and many lives were lost. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7099), An-Nasaa‘ee (5403) and At-Tirmidhee (2365), and the wording mentioned here belongs to him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>As sallamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Rabee’ bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“How is that you can rest O’ advising believer and you see the people of innovation plotting and the people of tribulation (fitan) and corruption plotting against your sons and your brothers  with respect to the ‘aqeedah (belief) and the manhaj (methodology)?!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How can you rest?!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Allah, we do not rest. By Allah, sometimes we do not sleep out of sadness for our sons and out of fear for them from losing their (deen) religion and their dunyah (wordly life)&#8230;”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<i>Marhaban Ya Taalib-ul-‘Ilm</i>, page 29, Daar-ul-Meeraathin-Nabawee, Algiers, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, 1434/2013)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah preserve Sheikh Rabee al-Madkhalee. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; Ruling on saying &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">We received a question from Makkah and it reads: Some Du`ah (callers to Islam) and lecturers say at the end of their lecture, &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan.&#8221; What is the ruling on saying that? Please, enlighten us. May Allah enlighten you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>There is nothing wrong &#8211; I see &#8211; with saying that, as it is the truth</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lecturer, teacher, preacher or anyone else giving advice should observe Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and seek the truth. If they do well, it is due to Allah&#8217;s Favor on them and if they err, it is due to their negligence and Satan. Allah (Glorified be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) are free from such error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the Grantor of success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#666699;">Taken From A lecture ‘From the Principles of the <em>Dawatus-Salafeeyah</em>’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a Muslim is guided to the path of goodness, some say that it is necessary for him to adhere to a Shaykh from whom he can take a <em>Tareeqah</em> (a path) because Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; the Most Merciful, so ask about Him one well informed. &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is truthful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.  &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh Answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – also says: &lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said in the story of the man who went on a battle along with some of the Companions of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>.</em>This man became afflicted with wounds, and in the morning he became defiled and thus it was obligatory upon him to have a <em>Ghusl</em> (ritual washing). He asked those around him if they could find a concession for him so that he would not have to make a<em>Ghusl</em>.  They said to him you must make a <em>Ghusl</em>, he did so and died due to those wounds that were upon his body, when that news reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They killed him, may Allaah fight them, if only they had asked when they did not know indeed that is the cure for any question.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that these two previously mentioned <em>Ayaat</em> and this hadeeth places the Islaamic world in regards to knowledge and ignorance into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category are few in number and they are the people of knowledge and the other category are more in number and they are those who do not know, as you have heard in the previous <em>Ayaah</em> &lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.  &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]   Allaah placed an obligation upon every one of these two types.  He made it obligatory upon those who do not know to ask the People of knowledge and He made it obligatory upon the People of Knowledge to answer the questioner as is authentically reported from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals that knowledge then he will be reined with a rein/bridle made of fire on the Day of Judgement.’ [Collected by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi &amp; authenticated by Albaani in Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary for the one who is not an <em>‘Aalim</em> (scholar) that he should be a student of knowledge or at the very least he should ask the people of knowledge as is mentioned in the <em>Athar</em> from Mu’adh <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be a scholar, or one who learns knowledge, or one who listens to knowledge, and do not be the fourth and be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last one is the one who does not listen to knowledge nor asks about it, so at that time he lives like an ignorant person not knowing how to worship Allaah –<em>Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asking the people of knowledge is an issue where there is a difference of opinion, as for adhering to a Shaykh, a Shaykh of a <em>Tariqah</em> (following a certain Soofi path), then here you have come to know that the path which reaches to Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – is the straight path which the noble Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> left us upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are those who direct/show/indicate this path, so they are the ones to whom it is obligatory to ask, and it is not permissible to adhere to a Shaykh and single him out to follow, and to learn from him and not to learn from the other scholars, because here occurs a great mistake which is that just like as it is obligatory upon us to single out Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – Alone for worship, it is also obligatory upon us to single out the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in following him and it is not allowed to stick and follow just one from amongst the scholars, no matter how this scholar from amongst them was from the excellent and standing, since this status is not for anyone, except the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and this is from the meaning of the statement of the one who witnesses that: <em>‘Ashhadu all</em><em>a ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareeka lahu wa anna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu</em> (I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’)  so he is the one who has to be followed from amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim adheres to one Shaykh or one teacher who teaches him, and he does not benefit from the other <em>Mushayikh</em> and other scholars from knowledge then this is violation of following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>because it is necessary to take all the scholars as indicators/directors who show us what our Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, and one single scholar no matter how much knowledge he has been given, and the matter regarding him and the right of every scholar, Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – said: &lt;&lt;And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little. &gt;&gt; [Al-Isra: 85] so this is an old superstition of the<em>Soofeeyah</em> that it is obligatory that every Muslim has to adhere to a Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: that it is obligatory upon every Muslim that he should be either a scholar or a learner or a listener or otherwise he will be destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for adhering to a Shaykh and singling him out alone then this is from the actions of the <em>Shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – to give us all the capability to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah and what the Salaf as-Salih were upon and keep us away from following other paths, upon which at the head of every path is a <em>Shaytaan</em> calling the people to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way&gt;&gt; [An’am: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all Praise belongs to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings be on His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that seeking knowledge is from the most virtuous acts of worship. And it is from the causes that bring about the success of Paradise and honor for those who act on it. From the most important of matters, is that one have sincerity in his search for knowledge, and this is by making his studying for the sake of Allaah and not for any other objective. This is because this is the way for one to derive benefit from it and a means for successfully attaining the highest of positions in this world and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Hadeeth that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever learns some knowledge, by which Allaah&#8217;s Face is sought, but he doesn&#8217;t learn it except to achieve some worldly goal by it, he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise on the Day of Judgement.&#8221;</b> &#8211; Reported by Abu Dawood with a hasan (sound) chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Timidhee reported a hadeeth with a chain in which there is some weakness, that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever seeks knowledge to compete with the scholars or to debate with the ignorant ones or so that the people&#8217;s faces can turn towards him, then Allaah will enter him into the Hellfire.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise every student of knowledge and every Muslim to have sincerity with Allaah in all of their actions, acting on the words of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So whoever hopes for meeting his Lord, then let him do righteous deeds and not mix anyone (or thing) with the worship of His Lord.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Kahf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Saheeh Muslim, the Prophet is reported to have said: <b>&#8220;Allaah said: &#8216;I am the most free of all those who are mixed in worship with Me from shirk. Whoever does a deed in which he mixes someone else along with Me (in the worship), I abandon him and his shirk.'&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise the student of knowledge and every Muslim to fear Allaah and to acknowledge that Allaah is watching Him in every matter, acting on Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Verily those who fear their Lord with the unseen (i.e. they do not see Him), they will have forgiveness and a great reward.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Mulk: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: <b>&#8220;And whoever fears the position of His Lord will have two Gardens.&#8221;</b> [Surah Ar-Rahmaan: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said: <b>&#8220;The pinnacle of knowledge is fear of Allaah.&#8221; And &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) said: &#8220;It is sufficient as knowledge that one fear Allaah. And it is sufficient as ignorance that one is deceived about this.&#8221;</b> And some of the Salaf said: &#8220;Whoever is the most knowledgeable about Allaah, he is the most fearing of Him.&#8221; What indicates the correctness of this understanding is the saying of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>&#8220;As for me, by Allaah, I am the most fearing of Allaah amongst you and the most dutiful (having Taqwaa) to Him amongst you.&#8221;</b> &#8211; Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every time the servant&#8217;s knowledge of Allaah becomes strengthened, this is a means for the perfection of his Taqwaa and Ikhlaas, and his stopping at the limits (set by Allaah), and his refraining from sinful acts. This is why Allaah said: <b>&#8220;Verily, only those who fear Allaah from His servants are the knowledgeable ones (i.e. the scholars).&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the ones who are knowledgeable of Allaah and His Religion, they are the ones who fear Him the most and who are the most dutiful to him from amongst the people. At the head of them are the messengers and prophets, &#8216;alayhim as-Salaam, and then those that follow them in goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed us that from the signs of success is that the servant of Allaah acquires fiqh (or understanding) of the Religion, as He said: <b>&#8220;Whoever Allaah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the Religion.&#8221;</b> &#8211; Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from the hadeeth of Mu&#8217;awiyah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). This is for no other reason except due to the fact that understanding of the Religion will prompt the servant to establish Allaah&#8217;s Commandments, to fear Him and to carry out His obligations and to stay away from those things that draw His displeasure. And it will call him towards good manners and righteous actions and in being sincere to Allaah and His servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I ask Allaah that He grant us and all the students of knowledge, as well as all the Muslims, understanding of His Religion and perseverance upon it. And I ask that He grant us refuge from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Indeed He is in charge of that and able to carry it out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the etiquettes related to books is that one should make an effort to care for and reinforce their outer and inner parts as well as to keep them clean so that the books can be in a presentable condition that is befitting for others besides you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since when a student of knowledge buys a book, he must have or should we say it&#8217;s preferred for him to have two types of intentions. The first is that he should intend to benefit from it in order to free himself from ignorance. And secondly, he should intend that others benefit from the book as well &#8211; such as either his wife or his children. Afterward, the books can either remain with that person (in his family) or they can be donated after him. Or perhaps one can give them away to someone as a gift or sell them, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every time someone takes care of his books &#8211; whether by binding them or preserving them so that they can last longer in the future &#8211; the result of this is that his reward and recompense will be greater for doing that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the amazing stories about negligence shown towards books is what was reported by Al-Qiftee, author of the book<i> Inbaa&#8217;-ur-Ruwaat</i>, concerning the story about him and the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-Sam&#8217;aanee. Perhaps I mentioned it to you before. Al-Qiftee was very enthusiastic for books so much so that he had gathered a collection of books that was from the best of what could be compiled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;The book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-San&#8217;aanee in the author&#8217;s own handwriting was presented to me, and it consisted of the second, third and fourth volumes, however, the first volume in the author&#8217;s handwriting was missing.&#8221; Even though there was a span of close to 250 years between the time of Al-Qiftee and that of As-Sam&#8217;aanee, he nevertheless purchased the three volumes and said: &#8220;So I bought them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then some time had passed during which he would continuously ask people about this book trying to find the first volume. He kept asking about it and getting nothing in reply to the point that he thought the book was missing and that that was the end of it. Perhaps the book written in the author&#8217;s handwriting had been borrowed by someone and then went missing or it had gotten lost, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on to say: &#8220;Then one day, my servant brought me a parcel of legumes &#8211; i.e. a kind of vegetable &#8211; wrapped up in pieces of paper that appeared to be originally from a book. So I grabbed the paper before the legumes&#8221; &#8211; since they had no value to him compared to these pieces of paper &#8211; &#8220;and when I looked at it, behold it was the handwriting of As-Sam&#8217;aanee, which I recognized! I then took it to my copy of the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> and discovered that this page was from the first volume that was missing! So I rushed in haste to the one who was selling the legumes and found that only a few pages from it were still left. So I asked him: &#8216;Where are the rest of these papers?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;We wrapped legumes with it and they are dispersed throughout the people&#8217;s homes.'&#8221; So he said: &#8220;Verily, to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone&#8217;s loss is another person&#8217;s gain! This one is sad because of his loss, while the other is happy because he found these pieces of paper which contain the handwriting of Al-Haafidh As-Sam&#8217;aanee that have no value to him and which he instead used to wrap legumes in and give out to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said that he, i.e. Al-Qiftee, then spent a month mourning over knowledge and its people and for the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-Sam&#8217;aanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wanted to say by relaying this story that one must take special care of his books &#8211; whether by way of reinforcing them or by way of preserving them. If one has the pages of a book all over the place then it is easy that the pages will get lost. But if they are preserved and attached to each other, this is the best way to guarantee that they will continue to exist in your library.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issues related to this subject are many. Perhaps what we mentioned here will serve as a reminder for some of the things that are required with regard to books. I ask Allaah to grant myself and you success, correctness, uprightness and guidance, and may the peace, praises and blessings of Allaah be on our prophet, Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the etiquettes related to caring for books, even though this topic is vast and covers many aspects, is that a student of knowledge should review and examine his books from time to time. This means that he should not amass books without reviewing what he has. So, for example, he goes out and gets this book and that book, puts them in his library and only refers to a small portion from them. One should continuously inspect all of his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should go and examine what books you have so that you remember the subjects they cover. This is since some people buy the same book twice or three times or maybe even four times due to the fact that they have forgotten that they already have the book! And this is because of the few times that they inspect and review their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if one were to have a constant connection to his books &#8211; especially in countries such as ours where the libraries of some of the students of knowledge are big &#8211; if he does not review his books, perhaps he will ask to borrow the book from someone when he already has it himself! Or perhaps he may forget what is in the book or need to research a topic but because he doesn&#8217;t review his collection, he makes no reference to that book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another etiquette regarding books is one&#8217;s concern for donated books. Donated books refer to any book that has an imprint or seal on it that states that it is a donation (i.e.<i> waqf</i>). You may only keep these books in your library so long as you meet the donor&#8217;s conditions. When a person donates books he is (firstly) making them available for the students of knowledge. If you are not using the book and someone else needs it, then giving the book to someone else that needs it is better. Yes, you may have a valid need for the book, even if it is one time in the year that you refer to it. There is nothing wrong with this since this book was given as a donation for the students of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if you do not refer to the book and two years or four to five years have passed by without you looking into it and you acknowledge that you have no interest in referencing this book or these books in general or perhaps you won&#8217;t need the book in the future, then in this case your keeping it contradicts its purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars say that it is not permissible to keep these books (in this situation) and that they should be given to those who deserve them. They should be passed on to those who will use them and benefit from them. This is since the donor has intended them as donations for only those who will use them. If you are not using them then it is more fitting that it should go to someone who will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some students of knowledge that feel that they are above keeping donated books if they have a lot of money and are able to obtain the book by buying it. This is since perhaps one may store away the book and not use it. So if the book is a charitable copy then it may be that he is sinning for withholding this book from someone who can use it. This is perhaps more noticeable in countries in which books are more scarce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A student should arrange his books in such a way that it is easy for him to refer to them if there is an issue that requires him to research some of his books. This means that he should maintain his books in a certain order. The way the books are to be organized depends on the preference of this student. So if he requires that all of his books on Tafseer be arranged together and all of his books on Hadeeth be arranged together, and he further divides the Tafseer section into its various sciences and the Hadeeth section into its various sciences, and the Fiqh books into their respective<i> madh-hab&#8217;s</i> and so on and so forth, then there is no harm in this. And if he decides to arrange his books in some other order that he feels is more beneficial, then there is also no problem with this. The objective is for the book to be in a place where if he looks for it, he will find it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Books are divided into two types: Large books and small treatises. As for the large books, then these are the ones that we see in a library. This is since they are big &#8211; 10 volumes, 15 volumes, 13 volumes, 14 volumes, etc. This is clear. Rather, what deserves special attention are the small treatises, which are also important. It is possible that these smaller books may contain knowledge that cannot be found in the bigger books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he needs to refer to one of these small treatises, he looks for it but can&#8217;t find it. Why? It is because he has not put it in its proper place. One should take special care of these small treatises by putting them in a separate area. This means that they should not be put amidst the works of research and the larger books. So for example, a person may put a large book on his shelf and then next to it place a small book, in terms of its pages, and then next to that a small 40-50 page treatises and so on! The scholars have devoted some of their attention to this aspect, such that they have put forth what they call &#8220;compilations&#8221; consisting of a volume or more in which there can be found 10 or 12 treatises or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it&#8217;s possible, a student of knowledge should compile these small treatises into a collection, placing booklets of a similar subject into one volume. This means that he should put all the small treatises that deal with the manners of seeking knowledge in one specific volume, for example, or the small treatises that deal with the subject of Hadeeth terminology in a separate volume or the essays on the sciences of Tafseer and the sciences of Qur&#8217;aan in one specific collection and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he should place his Fiqh-related books and treatises separately. It is also appropriate to divide the Fiqh-related books and treatises into different sections, within themselves, according to what topics of Fiqh (jurisprudence) they fall under. So for example, one should place a treatise on crimes in its proper place amongst the chapters of Fiqh, thus organizing his books in this manner. He should begin with the treatises that deal with purification, followed by the treatises that deal with prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even those treatises on prayer should be subdivided into those that deal with the conditions of prayer first followed by the rulings on prayer which include the prostration of forgetfulness, for example. Each book should be put in its proper place. They should not be placed in the section of Zakaat, say, which comes after the prayer. The same should then be done with similar treatises, i.e. these small booklets that are hard to locate if one needs to refer to them. They should be organized according to their subjects of jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the rest of the Islamic sciences whether they deal with history, Creed or their likes. One should put the books that cover Creed in general amongst the general books or treatises on Creed. Or he should place those subjects on Creed that he is researching into different sections on Creed so that it is easy for him to refer back to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first etiquette with regard to books is that one must organize his books in a good manner. Maintaining one&#8217;s library in order is an indication of a student of knowledge&#8217;s regard for his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if you visit and are granted access to a person&#8217;s library and find that his books are scattered around, in disorder and so on, this is due to ether one of two possibilities. The books are this way either because (1) the person researches his books a lot and needs to refer to them, thus causing his books to be scattered about &#8211; and even though this is something praiseworthy he should still put them back in their proper places afterward &#8211; or (2) he does not organize his books at all to begin with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his book on the judges of Egypt, which is called<i> Raf&#8217;u-il-Isr &#8216;an Qudaat Misr</i>, Al- Haafidh Ibn Hajr records a biography of one of the judges in Egypt and mentioned that when he was granted his judicial position, he would sit in a place where his books were on display. His books would be arranged in a nice and neat order. A student of knowledge entered his office once and saw his books and said: &#8220;What excellent order these books are in!&#8221; He was insinuating that the neat order and arrangement that his books were in indicated his lack of referencing them and using them. The judge understood this and kept it a secret to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, this man that had criticized the judge for having his books neatly arranged was put in charge of recording people&#8217;s marriages, i.e. the marriage contracts &#8211; something like an official that is licensed to wed couples. So the judge discovered that he had made an error in one of his marriage certificates and then rebuked him harshly. This shows that he had preserved that statement he made (a long time ago) in his memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that this student used the fact that the judge&#8217;s books were neatly arranged as proof that he didn&#8217;t read or use them. But this is not always the case. If a student of knowledge wants to work on a subject or research an issue and he takes a number of books out, putting them in front of him and looking into this one and looking into that one, when he finishes, he should return them back to their proper place so that it will be easy for him to refer back to them at a later time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of dealing with books is that a student of knowledge focuses his attention on the revised and accurate editions of books only. In the old days, books used to be bought from a manuscript transcriber known as a<i> warraaq</i>. A person was called a<i> warraaq</i> if he had a place where he would manually transcribe a copy of a book and sell it to buyers or sell it to someone who intended to sell his manuscripts (i.e. dealers). These people were known as <i>warraaqoon</i> &#8211; those who devoted their time to transcribing books by hand or to just selling books. Amongst these transcribers were those who were vary careful in their work and others who weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest things in resemblance to them in our time are the publishing houses and print shops that exist today. They have inherited the work of the <i>warraaqoon</i> throughout the passage of time. This is why we say that the occupation of the copyists was taken over in detail as time passed on by the scholars. A student of knowledge should strive to buy a verified and edited book or to transcribe one by hand whilst comparing what he has copied to the original manuscript. Or he should buy a book and compare it with a reliable source copy that is studied in the presence of scholars and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What this means is that a student of knowledge should focus on acquiring the authentic and verified editions of book whether in manuscript or published form. In this day and age, most of the students of knowledge devote their attention and concern to only the published books. This is why we see that the books in print today are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publication of books in the Arabic Language began a little more than five centuries ago, i.e. printing books in Arabic started more than 500 years ago, which was around 1400-1500 AD, since that is the time they were dated. However, the majority of the books that were printed in the Arabic Language in the Arab and Muslim lands only occurred in the last two-hundred years. Whatever was printed before that was published in the western countries due to their high regard for publishing books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of all this is to show that the publication of books is something old and well established. Today one can find displayed in the marketplaces and stores a variety of different publishing companies, books, and names of verifiers and editors, etc. This is why many times that a phrase or a sentence is quoted from a recently published book, which is not necessarily revised accurately or precisely, the result is that discrepancies and mix-ups occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This happened to me several times while teaching in the mosque&#8217;s study area. I confirm the reading of a passage (from a book being studied), for example, based on an accurate edition of the book, then one of the students of knowledge comes and presents a recent edition of the same book in which the passage in there is inaccurate. The reason for this is because the contemporary publishing companies are not all precise and meticulous with the books they print. This also can apply to the older publishing companies. So regardless if the book was published a long time ago or recently, you should strive to find which edition of the book is the most accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are interested in purchasing a book or acquiring knowledge on some subject, you must seek to attain the most accurate edition of the book that has been published with precision. So you should ask the people of knowledge or those who have expertise on this subject, saying for example: &#8220;What is the most reliable edition of such and such book?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of <i>Tafseer Al-Qurtubee</i>?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of<i> Tafseer At- </i><i>Tabaree</i>?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of<i> Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree</i>?&#8221; &#8211; which if you acquire, you will keep in your library and have no need for another edition of the book to go along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we have observed today from many publications is that you find the publishing companies only print books for commercial purposes and so they come out unreliable. This is why you should ask about which edition you should acquire or which edition you want to purchase. So you should not just buy any book that is thrown at you. Rather, you should ask about it and become aware of the publishing company that has produced it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a certain individual has verified and reviewed the publication of the book, you should ask about whether or not this individual is accurate or inaccurate in his verification. Is he a businessman or not? And so on and so forth. To reiterate, a student of knowledge should focus on acquiring only the most accurate edition of a particular book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should only buy a book after enquiring about it. For example, you should ask: &#8220;Which is the most accurate edition of<i> Tafseer Al-Qurtubee</i>?&#8221; So if you receive an answer to this question, you should then go and strive to acquire this edition of the book regardless of whether it is printed or photocopied or published in modern times via computer formatting. You should strive to acquire only the correct and accurate editions of books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have noticed according to my opinion is that most of the books that the brothers have in their hands are editions that are not accurate and precise. They may have a valid copy of the book however it is not completely accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some individual has taken charge of the overview of its publication but what he has done can hardly be called &#8220;taking charge.&#8221; Or it is said that the edition was amended by the publishing house and so on and so forth, however, it contains mistakes and errors the likes of which make the edition defective and not fit for a student of knowledge to acquire and reference and use for researching information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the second etiquette is that a student of knowledge should strive to acquire the accurate and precise editions regardless of whether they are printed in older form or they are recent publications. What is important is that the edition is accurate. So one should get to know and become acquainted with which publishing companies are meticulous and precise and which publishing companies are not. This is so that he will be able to know and distinguish which editors are just interested in business from which ones show great concern and care for their verifications. By doing this, he will also be able to tell the advantages that certain editions have over others, as well as how many times one book has been published.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will diverge from the topic a little here and say that a student of knowledge should also be careful when looking into verifications and what people do nowadays such as placing footnotes and comments in their books. He should be aware of the different editions that exist for a book because it may be for example that an editor makes a reference to a volume and page number of a particular book and the reader believes that the book was only printed once. So when he goes to reference the volume and page number of the edition that he has, he cannot find it and says: &#8220;This person has erred or made a mistake.&#8221; It is possible that this same book was published over a hundred times or twenty times of thirty times or five times or four times and so on and so forth. So if a student of knowledge is aware of the different editions of the book and the number of times it was printed and the advantages and merits that some editions have over others, this is from the supplementary forms of knowledge that is from the general etiquettes that a student of knowledge should abide by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third etiquette with regard to books is that one must strive to keep his books clean and preserved. This means that his books should be clean and have no dust attached to them. They should not be dirty nor should they have any bad markings on them. They should also not be put in an improper place, meaning the book should be put in an appropriate place that is befitting for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is not befitting for books &#8211; especially the books of the people of knowledge in which can be found a clarification of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; is that they have dirt, dust and filth on them. Keeping books clean is a sign of one&#8217;s respect for what is contained in them and a proof that one magnifies the symbols of Allaah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ِبﻮُﻠُﻘْﻟا ىَﻮْﻘَﺗ ﻦِﻣ ﺎَﻬﱠﻧِﺈَﻓ ِﻪﱠﻠﻟا َﺮِﺋﺎَﻌَﺷ ْﻢﱢﻈَﻌُﻳ ﻦَﻣَو<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever magnifies the symbols of Allaah, then that is truly from the piety of the hearts.&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Hajj: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the book is on Tafseer or on the Sunnah or on Fiqh &#8211; the lawful and unlawful &#8211; or on Creed, then a person should strive to preserve them. Maintaining books clean falls under honoring Allaah and honoring the religious knowledge that is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When dealing with books, from the perspective of preserving and safeguarding them, a student of knowledge should also be careful of not turning his book into a parcel for his documents, special essays or receipts, i.e. such as the sales receipts for the books he bought and so on. If you were to pick up one of his books and look at it you would find that there is a receipt and a treatise inside it or that there is a pen and an eraser inside it and so on an so forth. Some of the scholars have said: &#8220;Do not turn your book into a bouquet or a parcel.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the important etiquettes with regard to books &#8211; that you not turn them into storage bins such as by placing pens inside them or treating them like repositories for money and currency. So if you were to open up a book you would find all of these things inside them and notice that the book&#8217;s binding has become worn and that the book has changed and so on due to the book not being preserved properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book should also not be turned into a bouquet, i.e. it should not be folded in an inappropriate manner, since a book contains the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace be upon him). So it is not proper to treat a book in this manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also not proper to put a glass of water or a cup of tea or their likes on top of books. The books of the people of knowledge, which contain texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah should be put in the highest places and not in the lowest places with pieces of paper and such on top of them. Abiding by this etiquette instills respect in the heart for the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah, not to mention the knowledge that is derived from these two sources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also related to preserving books is when a student of knowledge is careful in the manner that he records text from books. Sometimes, we see books with written comments in them that are annotated in such a way that their benefit is squandered. In what has preceded, we have seen that the scholars forbade from writing small letters in books, such as when you write notes using tiny lettering or when you make notes on points of benefit found in your book using such small letters that if a student of knowledge wanted to, he would not be able to benefit from them. In what has been reported, Imaam Ahmad one time regretted having recorded<i> ahaadeeth</i> with small handwriting. This is since when he needed to refer to them in his old age, he was not able to extract these points of benefit because they were written in very tiny letters and the ink from the letters were so close to each other that it was hard to read and thus the benefit was lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars or students of knowledge may not have good handwriting. This is not a flaw. However, one should arrange his letters in such a way that they are written clearly. This is since some of the scholars who didn&#8217;t possess good handwriting would not be able to read even their own handwriting, as was the case with Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah whose writings would have to be extracted by one of his students. This is mentioned in the books on Biographies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer indicated this in the 14th volume of his collection<i> al- </i><i>Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</i> while discussing the year in which this student of Ibn Taimiyyah passed away. He said: &#8220;And he was the one who would be able to extract the second sermon of Ibn Taimiyyah. And whenever Ibn Taimiyyah would want to take a portion (from his writings), no one would be able to extract it except for him since Shaikh-ul-Islaam (Ibn Taimiyyah) would write in a hurry and his writings would be unclear, so at times it would appear obscure to him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was due to the letters being written very small. This could work, however it is not possible all the time, which is why a student of knowledge needs to know how to write in his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth have advised in their etiquettes on writing that when a student of knowledge wants to write, he should start from the line that he is in or in which can be found the note, then continue by going up towards the top and not the bottom. This means that when you study a book with a teacher or you make notes in a book and you come upon an area where you begin writing (a comment), you should transfer from that line to a line above it. The reason for this is because you may encounter a point of benefit in the line that follows that one, which requires you to write a note for it, and so then you will be confused on how to write it. Start ascending to the line above it. If you write from the bottom to the top, this will ensure that your writing will be clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also try to make your lines straight but designed in a sloping manner such that if you want to correct anything later, you can insert that correction in the empty spaces that are between the slants. Perhaps some of you have seen some of the old books with notes in them and noticed that these (notes) were written in blocks of text that appear to be in the shape of triangles. This was not done in vain and without purpose. Rather, these books were written this way &#8211; in the manner of the ancestors &#8211; because they needed to be verified afterward. The corrections would be placed in the empty spaces (on the sides of the triangle) or the book would be compared to another manuscript and notes from that manuscript would be annotated in these empty spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, you must give great importance to having handwriting that is clear and organized in terms of knowing the place where the writing starts. So if I were to look at what you wrote and the notes you made, I would know where the note you made for this sentence begins and in which direction it will go.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, if you reference the books on terminology, their authors have explained how to write and make notes in books using guidelines and details that they have established on either preserving the text, explaining a word, making a correction, writing a footnote, clarifying which manuscript it is or how to write valid phrases and so on. So we should refer to these books on terminology because their authors wrote about this and talked about it in detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Another etiquette regarding books which deserves attention is: A student of knowledge should maintain (a list of) selected points of benefit for each of his books. This means that if someone reads a book and he doesn&#8217;t feel that he will remember or be able to recall what he read later &#8211; even if he is young &#8211; he should select points of benefit from this book and write them down in a special notebook. Or he can make references to them in the preface of the book, such as in a page at the beginning of the book. So he makes something that resembles a table of contents, however, it is specifically catered to him since these points of benefit that apply to him may not apply to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are specifically for you when you need to reference something you learned from this book at a later time. Two nights ago, I took the book<i> al-Fadl-ul- </i><i>Mubeen fee Sharh al-Arba&#8217;een</i> of Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee from its place in my library. It had been almost ten years since I last read the book, but when I opened it up to its first page, lo and behold, I found the points of benefit in the book that I had written down a long time ago. And there were many, many points of benefit of which I had forgotten almost ninety percent of them. So instead of reading the book over again, all I had to do was look at this point of benefit and that point of benefit and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the points of benefit found in the book, for example, was the author&#8217;s discussion on the difference between the<i> &#8216;Aalim</i> and the<i> &#8216;Aarif</i> and the reason why the Sufis renounced the word<i> &#8216;Aalim</i> in favor of using the word<i> &#8216;Aarif</i> and why they say the &#8216;Aarif so and so and not the &#8220;&#8216;Aalim&#8221; (i.e. scholar) so and so. This is one of the points of benefit found in this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit in the book was an excellent and firm quote from Ibn Hazm found in his book<i> al-Fisal</i> on the meanings of the (verbs)<i> qadaa</i> (to divinely ordain) and<i> qaddara</i> (to divinely pre-decree). At the end of the quote, Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee says: &#8220;And this is the most brilliant of what was said concerning the meaning of<i> qadaa</i> and<i> qaddara</i> and what has the most right to be accepted.&#8221; And it is just as he said. Perhaps I will relate that to you at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These points of benefit that you record at the beginning of the book are very important. If you refer to the book some time after reading it, you will find these points before you. This means that when you read a book or a group of books, you should select points from them, which you feel are beneficial and useful to you and annotate them at the beginning of the book in the first page. So it will take the form of an index with brief phrases describing the point of benefit (and the page number where it can be found).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this is extremely important for a student of knowledge. If you are able to make a special notebook in which you can place selected points that you may need, then this is important and you will definitely refer to it later on in time. It is not proper for you to read a book just like this and say that this (one-time) reading is sufficient because after one or two months or maybe after a year, you will forget what you read.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if you write down (the most important points of) what you read, you can refer back to it years later and find that the points of benefit are available for display before you, as the saying goes: &#8220;Understanding is contingent &#8211; it comes and goes, whereas writing is recorded.&#8221; Write down what you have understood or record what you have learned from the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From the etiquettes related to books, also, is: The manners of lending out books. Giving out books for people to borrow is not allowed unless you are giving them to someone that you trust will care for the books. The reason for this is because you have the most right to your book, unless you find someone else that is in need of it and who, when finished using it, will return it back to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the biography of Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee that a man once asked him if he could borrow one of his books, so he replied saying: &#8220;You have three days to use it.&#8221; The man said: &#8220;That is not enough time.&#8221; So Al-Khateeb said: &#8220;I have counted its pages, so if you want to make a copy of it, then three days is sufficient for you. And if you want to read it, then three days is sufficient for you. And if you want to do more than that with it, then I have the most right to my book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is correct, since in the past I had lent the first volume of a large book consisting of eight volumes to a brother &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to mention the title of the book, since perhaps he may hear this and think that I&#8217;m insinuating him &#8211; and now nearly twelve years have passed on, and he still has not returned it to me! And he tells me he doesn&#8217;t know where he put it. Similarly, the eighth volume of another set &#8211; even though I&#8217;m not worried so much over it &#8211; however, more than twenty years have passed and until now, he has not given it back. This is why a poet once said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Do not lend your books<br />
</i><i style="line-height:1.5em;">And make your answer some excuse<br />
</i><i>Whoever does in fact lend a book,<br />
</i><i>I swear he has not done something good.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another person said: &#8220;The perdition of books is in lending them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was once said to a man from India who had opened up a huge library: &#8220;How did you create this library?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;By borrowing books from people.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;How is that?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;I borrow a book and don&#8217;t return it. This is how I was able to create this library.&#8221; The man asked: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a crime against those you borrow from?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Whoever lends his books to people is insane. And whoever gives back what he borrows is even more insane than him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since souls are attached to books. In his book<i> al-Qawaa&#8217;id</i>, while speaking about a principle, Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab mentioned that there is no capital punishment of cutting off the hand for stealing them &#8211; i.e. if a person steals a book, then according to some scholars, he does not have to have his hand cut off. This is since there is a doubt in this &#8211; i.e. that the truth contained in books is (free) for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, one of your fellow students or colleagues may get a book and then believe that he has a right to it, especially if the book is a charitable copy or it was given to you as a gift or so on. So this would cause him to take the issue of returning it lightly. He will be lax in giving the book back. And you will be the one who loses out on the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if you are not sure if the one who is asking to borrow a book from you is serious and will benefit from it in a short amount of days and nights, then do not lend him the book. This is since when you lend your books out to people, you are depriving yourself from their benefit. And not every one that borrows a book can be trusted with it, for how many people have borrowed books and not returned them!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">Source:Introduction of his classic book Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm Al-&#8216;Amal</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;"> Translator:abu maryam</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;">al-manhaj.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We give thanks to Allaah, the One free of all defects, for having inspired us. And we ask Him to grant us the ability to act upon what He has given us knowledge of. Indeed, goodness cannot be attained, except by His granting and His assistance. Whomsoever Allaah leads astray, there is no one from His creation that can guide him. May Allaah send His blessings upon Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam), the chief of the first and the last (of people), and upon his brothers from among the prophets and messengers. And upon those who follow the light (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) that was revealed to him SAW until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I advise you O seeker of knowledge to have a sincere and pure intention in your search for knowledge. And that you exert yourself in acting upon what it necessitates (from action). For indeed knowledge is a tree and action is its fruit. And one can never be considered knowledgeable so long as he doesn&#8217;t act upon what he has knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been stated: &#8220;Knowledge is a parent and action is its offspring.&#8221; And &#8220;Knowledge comes with action, while narrating comes with investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not feel satisfied with actions so long as you are lacking in knowledge. Nor feel satisfied with knowledge so long as you fall short of producing actions. Rather, combine them both, even if your share of the two is small.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is nothing worse than a scholar, whose knowledge the people abandon because of the corruption of his ways, nor an ignorant person whose ignorance the people accept because of what they see from his worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a little of this (knowledge) along with a little of that (action) is what is most likely to save you in the end, when Allaah bestows His mercy upon His servant and completes his favor upon him. But as for laziness and negligence, love for ease and comfort, preferring the easy life and showing indifference, inclining towards leisure and relaxation, then the results of these characteristics are blameworthy, detestable and disastrous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge leads to action, just as action leads to salvation. So if the action falls short of the knowledge, then the knowledge becomes a burden upon the one who possesses that knowledge. And we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from knowledge that turns into a burden, is the cause of humiliation and which becomes a shackle on the neck of the one who possesses it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl Ibn Muzaahim (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The matter is more tighter upon a scholar than when one clenches his fist tightly, even though the ignorant person is not excused because of his ignorance (i.e. he will be held to account also). However, the scholar will receive a greater punishment if he abandons what he has knowledge of and doesn&#8217;t act upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So did those of our Salaf (predecessors) from the past reach the high levels that they reached except through sincerity in Creed (Beliefs), righteous actions and overwhelming abstinence of the attractive features of this worldly life? And did the wise people reach the greatest level of success (that they did) except by working hard in their efforts and being pleased with their easy accomplishments, while sacrificing the excess amount from their needs by giving it away to the poor and those who asked?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is not the one who gathers books of knowledge just like the one who gathers gold and silver? Is not the one who has an intense greed for them just like the one who is eager and desirous of gold and silver? Is not the one who is deeply in love with them just like the one who treasures gold and silver?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So just as wealth does not benefit except by it being spent, then likewise, knowledge does not benefit except for one who acts upon it and carries out its obligations. So let each individual examine himself and take advantage of his time, for indeed the resting place (i.e. this world) is short, the (time for) departure is near, the road is hazardous and deviating from it is common. The danger is great, the one who takes note has wisdom, Allaah, the Most High, is watching over, and to Him is the (final) recourse and return. &#8220;And whosoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of good, he shall see it. And whosoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil, he shall see it.&#8221; [99: 7-8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">[6] </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">: What are the books you recommend a young person that is starting out in his Islaamic studies to read?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is a novice, then from the books of Fiqh, we advise him to read <strong>&#8220;Fiqh As-Sunnah&#8221; of Sayyid Saabiq</strong>, while seeking assistance from some of its references, such as <strong>&#8220;Subul-us-Salaam </strong>(the ways of Peace &amp; Safety)<strong> &#8220;</strong> (of Imaam As-Sana&#8217;aanee, rahimahullaah). And if he looks into <strong>&#8220;Tamaam-ul-Mannah&#8221;</strong> (of Al-Albaanee) then that will be stronger for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise him to read &#8220;<strong>Ar-Rawdat-un-Nadiyyah</strong>&#8221; (of Sideeq Hasan Khaan).<br />
As for the subject of Tafseer, then he should habitually read from the book <strong>&#8220;Tafseer Al-Qur&#8217;aan-ul-&#8216;Adheem&#8221; of Ibn Katheer</strong> – [chm file download ]even though it is somewhat long – for it is the most authentic from the books of Tafseer today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, on the subject of religious exhortation and heart-softening narrations, he should read the book <strong>&#8220;Riyaad-us-Saaliheen&#8221; of Imaam An-Nawawee.</strong> [Daeef hadeeth in Riyadh us Saleheen &#8211; Albanee ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, with regard to the books related to Creed, I advise him to read the book <strong>&#8220;Sharh Al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah&#8221; of Ibn Abee Al-&#8216;Izz Al-Hanafee</strong>. And he should seek assistance, also, from my comments and explanations to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he should make it his customary practice to study from the<strong> books of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah</strong> and his student <strong>Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on them. For I hold them to be from the rare and unique Muslim scholars that have treaded upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors) in their understanding, while having Taqwaa and righteousness. And we do not purify anyone over Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Book :&nbsp;<strong><a title="Permanent Link to Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad&nbsp;Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/" rel="bookmark">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Ahmad&nbsp;Ash-Shihhee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that I do not mean by <strong> “Fundamentals”</strong> , the three categories of Tawheed only. Rather I intended that first, and secondly I meant by it, the other fundamentals, which Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah have agreed on and due to which they have separated themselves from the people of innovation and sects, such as the (the principles of):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Showing al-Walaa wal-Baraa (Loyalty and Disavowment), commanding the good and forbidding the evil, the (correct) stance towards the Sahaabah (Companions) – respecting and defending them, the position with respect to the Leaders, the stance with regard to the transgressors and sinners, and the position towards the People of Innovation – speaking against them and dealing with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes as well for all the other fundamentals that Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah have agreed upon and which they have put in their books on Creed, in order to clarify the truth and separate themselves from the people of deviation, calamities, vain desires and division – even though the source for some of these principles may be related to actions and not Creed. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you have gotten a firm grasp in understanding these points and fundamentals, then, by the Will of Allaah, you will be fortified against many of the misconceptions that are gushing throughout the Islamic world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when many of those who have repented become negligent in this matter and do not initiate their repentance by learning the fundamentals and methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, they become confused and lost with just the slightest of misconceptions! We ask Allaah to save and protect us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever reflects on the condition of these people, will find many instances and examples for this confusion and shakiness, amongst which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The First Example:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find the person who has turned to the Way of the Salaf, in the beginning, strict and determined to keep far away from the people of innovation and sects. This lasts for some time, but then he is presented a misconception from one who clothes himself in the garb of Salafiyyah, which in brief is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Staying away from the people of innovation and not sitting or mixing with them is not correct.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This causes many benefits to be missed out on.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no one after Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that is infallible. Even the Sahaabah made mistakes…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he does not hear these doubt-raising arguments except that you see his heart become diseased. And you see him drinking (from) this misconception faster than he drinks water. And lo and behold, thereafter, he begins to mix and associate with the people of innovation, becoming soft and easy-going with the principles of Salafiyyah, while doing this in the name of Salafiyyah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confusion only came about due to his failure to engage in learning the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the Salaf (Predecessors) of this ummah. And it was due to his failure to study the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. This is since if he were to have devoted time to seeking of knowledge, he would have known that this misconception is false and at variance with the position of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah towards the people of desires and innovation, in the past and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would have known that the statement of this false-claimer (to Salafiyyah): “There is no one after Allaah’s Messenger that is infallible” and “everyone make mistakes” are words of truth, but by which falsehood is intended. This is because when anyone amongst Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – from the Sahaabah and those who followed after them in goodness – made an error, their error did not come as a result of following desires, or failing to follow the narrations or distorting the texts or chasing after what is unclear and ambiguous from these texts, as is the case with the people of innovation. Rather, their error would come due to one of them not being aware of the proof for it or his knowing about it yet not considering it to be authentic, or any of the other reasons for which they have an excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following saying of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was revealed concerning them and concerning those who follow them in goodness: <strong>“When the judge issues a ruling, making Ijtihaad in the matter and is correct, he gets two rewards. And if he gives a ruling, making Ijtihaad in the matter, and is mistaken, he gets (only) one reward.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is contrary to the People of Innovation and Sects, since they do not have any concern for the narrations, and they give precedence to their intellects over the texts from the Book and the Sunnah! Rather, they establish principles that are in opposition to the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah! So these kinds of people are not to be sought excuses for, as that false-claimer (to Salafiyyah) had made excuses for them. <strong>And no one includes them in the same row as that of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah except for someone who is ignorant or an arrogant innovator!</strong> Another example is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Example:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find the person who has repented, in the beginning, enthusiastic and eager to criticize the people of innovation, but without any guidelines or knowledge. So he remains in this state for some period of time. Then he hears the misconceptions from those who claim to be upon Salafiyyah, saying that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Criticizing others is not from the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that “It hardens the hearts!” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that “So and so person used to criticize the groups (<em>jamaa’aat</em>), but then he reverted (i.e. went back to his old ways) as a result of that!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these doubts are not presented to him except that he turns around in his heels, and begins to reject this grand principle (of criticizing), which the Religion is established upon. Rather, perhaps you may even find him, after that, calling the people to abandon this principle, claiming that it hardens the hearts!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth with regard to this matter is that Criticizing is a grand principle, which the pure Religion is established upon. It is a strong aspect in safeguarding the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah from distortions. And it is a magnificent form of worship and a noble way of seeking nearness to Allaah, which causes the Muslim’s Eemaan to increase. <strong>However, this is only if it is implemented upon its proper conditions,</strong> such as having sincerity (i.e. not doing it except to please Allaah) and other conditions. So its state is the same as the state of any other act of worship, it increases one’s Eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> So the discrepancies are not in the principle, but rather they are in the person who implements this principle (of criticizing and refuting) without any (proper) guidelines. So when the misconception is met with acceptance in his heart, he finds fault with the principle (of criticizing) instead of finding fault in himself for his lack of applying the principle in a good manner.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we see in the Imaams of guidance – from the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een, and those who followed them in goodness –abstinence (<em>zuhd</em>), dutifulness to Allaah (<em>taqwaa</em>), fear of Him (<em>khashya</em>) and a soft heart along with their excessive criticism and talk concerning individuals and groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at ‘Abdullaah Ibn Al-Mubaarak and Ahmad bin Hanbal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at Yahyaa bin Ma’een and ‘Alee Ibn Al-Madeenee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at Abu Haatim Ar-Raazee and Al-Bukhaaree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The biographies of all of these scholars are filled with examples of their piety, fear and dutifulness to Allaah. So this confusion and instability is due to this repentant individual’s lack of sincerity and honesty in repenting to Allaah. And it is due to his lack of giving attention to learning the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah from the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, my repentant brother, you must beware of this kind of dangerous trap. And you must know that there is no way for you to be saved from these contagious misconceptions and these destructive traps unless Allaah grants you success (in that) and you begin by (first) learning the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. So be firm in this aspect, with earnestness and enthusiasm and strong determination, as Allaah says: <strong>“Hold onto that which We have given you with might (i.e. determination).”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must be truthful and have sincerity: <strong>“As for those who strive hard with regard to Us (i.e. Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our Paths (i.e. Allaah&#8217;s Religion). Verily, Allaah is with the good doers.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-&#8216;Ankaboot: 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And have certainty in the saying of Allaah: <strong>“And if We had ordered them (saying): ‘Kill yourselves (i.e. the innocent ones kill the guilty ones)’ or ‘Leave your homes’, very few of them would have done it. But if they had done what they were told, it would have been better for them, and it would have strengthened their Faith (Eemaan). And indeed We would have then bestowed on them a great reward from Ourselves. And indeed We would have guided them to a Straight Way.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of losing heart and being weak and of yielding to that which befalls you in the Way of Allaah (i.e. in your path to repentance). Do not forget Allaah’s saying: <strong>“But they never lost heart for that which befell them in Allaah&#8217;s Way, nor did they weaken or degrade themselves. And Allaah loves the patient ones.”</strong> [Surah Aali Imraan: 146]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Footnotes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> An example of this point would be the inclusion of the issue of wiping over the socks for ablution. The source for this issue stems from action, yet many of the scholars of the past, including Ahmad bin Hanbal, put it in their books on Creed, since by it they distinguished themselves from the people of desires and innovation, who rejected this aspect of the Sunnah based on it not conforming to their intellects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This is one of their outlandish claims! – Since the hardening of one’s heart can only occur due to opposing the Commandments of Allaah and His Messenger, not by following them. How can the heart of a person who forbids the evil, especially innovations and deviant beliefs, become hardened?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Calamities will be presented to the hearts just like a reed mat is woven stick by stick. So any heart that is immersed with them will have a black mark put on it, and any heart that rejects them will have a white mark put on it, to the point that there will become two types of hearts: A white heart that is like a stone, no fitnah (calamity) will be able to cause harm to it, so long as the heavens and the earth exist. And the other is a black heart, which is dust-colored like a vessel that is upturned, not enjoining what is good and not forbidding what is evil, except for that which it is immersed in from vain desires.”</span> [Saheeh&nbsp;Muslim: &nbsp;(Eng.) 1/267]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked which books he advises a student of knowledge to read in the areas of ‘Aqeedah, Tafseer, Hadeeth and its science, and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He specifically stated that a student should memorize and understand (in the topic of <b><i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i></b>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Usool ath-Thalaathah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>Shuroot us-Salaah wa Arkaanihaa wa Wajibaatihaa</b>,<br />
(3) <b>al-Qawaa’id ul-&#8216;Arba’ah</b>,<br />
(4) <b>Shuroot Laa Ilaaha illAllaah</b>,<br />
(5) <b>Nawaaqid ul-Islaam</b>, and<br />
(6) <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b>, all by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for (7) <b>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</b>, then he said that if a person memorizes it, then that is good, but he did not stress it as with the above works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, he did not stress memorizing (8) <b>al-Waasitiyyah</b>, but instead said that a student can either memorize it or learn it and understand it well.<br />
He also mentioned that a person should study (9) the various treatises contained in <b>Majmoo’ Fataawaa Shaykh ul-Islaam Bin Taymiyyah</b> (presumably <b>al-Fatwa al-Hamawiyyah al-Kubraa, ar-Risaalat ut-Tadmuriyyah, al-&#8216;Eemaan</b>, etc., although he did not name names), and (10) <b>Sharh ut-Tahaawiyyah</b> by Ibn Abee al-‘Izz al-Hanafee (d. 792) if he wants to expand his scope regarding the subject of Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other subjects, I do not recall him specifically saying that a student should memorize anything except for the one who desires to learn about the differences between the four madhaahib in <b><i>Fiqh</i></b>. He said that it is befitting for such a person to memorize a matan (lower level Fiqh manual) for each of the four madhaahib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the area of <b><i>hadeeth</i></b>, he mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Arba’een an-Nawawiyyah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b>, and<br />
(3) <b>Buloogh ul-Maraam</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although he did not specifically say that one should memorize them, I have heard other Scholars (such as Shaykh Saalih ibn ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh) say that one should begin his course in hadeeth with the memorization and study of <b>al-Arba’een</b>. The more famous explanations for it are that of an-Nawawee (d. 676) himself, which is a very brief explanation for beginners, that of Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed (d. 702), which is perhaps a middle-level explanation, and that of Ibn Rajab (d. 795), which is more advanced and thorough than the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have also recommended that the more advanced and dedicated students should memorize and learn the other two: <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b> and <b>Buloogh al-Maraam</b> by ‘Abdul-Ghanee al-Maqdisee (d. 600) and Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalaanee (d. 852) respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <b><i>tafseer</i></b>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said that a person should start with the tafseer of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa’dee (d. 1376), titled <b>Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaam il-Manaan</b>, because its author is a well-known Salafee (and hence does not fall into the same ta’weel and mistakes of the other lower-level tafaaseer, such as al-Jalaalayn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said that if a person can find a Salafee teacher to guide him, he should study <b>Fath ul-Qadeer</b> of Shawkaanee (d. 1250) – this is because the teacher will help him:<br />
(a) Be alert to some of the mistakes of Shawkaanee regarding as-Sifaat, and<br />
(b) Help him with the more difficult aspects of the &#8216;Arabic language that occur in the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, he mentioned <b>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</b>, stating that it is okay if a student studies from one of the various abridgements available nowadays (like that of ar-Rifaa’ee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taken From 22 Question About the Salafee Da&#8217;wah.</b><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong>Which books should a student of knowledge begin with? And then after those, if he wants to widen his study?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books, which a student of knowledge, who is a beginner, should start reading with [if he can read and write well] are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Fath ul-Majeed Sharh Kitaab ut-Tawheed , which is a mighty book,</li>
<li>Aqeedat ul-Waasitiyyah<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, </span></li>
<li>al-Qawl ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by our brother Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee, </span></li>
<li>Bulugh al-Maraam</li>
<li>Riyaadh us-Saaliheen</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you have read these books, you yourself will crave for more. If you could, start with the memorization of the Qur’aan, and this more good and desirable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the issue, regarding the &#8216;Arabic language, for our foreign brothers, then it is very important. If there is a foreign person who does not speak the &#8216;Arabic language well, then a person may come to him in his Islaamic appearance and then he begins to explain the Qur’aan to him other than how it ought to be, as happened with the Mu’tazilah.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Noble Shaykh, we desire that you give us the names of the valueable books in Tawheed and Fiqh?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books in the science of Tawheed and Islaamic Fiqh of old and of today are numerous, and that which I direct you all to read in the [science of] Tawheed are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>al-Usool uth-Thalaatha</b>, and <b>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</b>, and <b>al-Qawaa&#8217;id ul-&#8216;Arba&#8217;ah</b>, and <b>al-Usool ul-&#8216;Eemaan Sittah</b>, and <b>Masaa&#8217;il al-Jaahiliyyah</b>, and <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b>, and all of them are from Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). And after that <b>Kitaab al-Aqeedatul Waasitiyyah</b>, and <b>Kitaabul Hamawiyyah</b>, and both of them are from Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah). And the <b>Nooniyyah</b> of Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullaah) with it&#8217;s explanation, and <b>al-Hayyaat Fee Dhillil Aqeedatil Islaamiyyah</b> by the writer of these letters [meaning the author is the Shaykh himself], and <b>al-Irshaad</b> by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, and <b>al-Aqeedatus Saheehah wa Maa Yudaaduhaa</b> by the Noble Shaykh &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah), and <b>Qawlul Mufeed</b> by al-Fawzaan also, and <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b> of Ibn Khuzaymah, and <b>Kutubus-Sunnah</b> that have been written [and or recorded] in the science of &#8216;Aqeedah are numerous, as I have previously mentioned some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islaamic Fiqh, likewise the books are numerous, but begin with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>al-Umdah</b> and it&#8217;s explanation, and the summarized versions of the books of the Hanaabilah, and the <b>Mulakhas al-Fiqhee</b> of al-Fawzaan, and the books of hadeeth that have been explained like the explanation of <b>Umdatul Ahkaam</b>, and <b>Subulus-Salaam</b> [which is the explanation of] <b>Bulughul Maraam</b>, and <b>al-Muntaqaa</b> and it&#8217;s explanation like <b>Naylul Awtaar</b>, then you precede in the reading of the books while exerting ones&#8217; self with the utmost exertion in seeking counsel with those who follow the Salaf in the books that you love to read either by way of telephone or through sending messages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah make you all successful in that which pleases Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Dealing With The Books Of Knowledge<br />
</span>Author: Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Source: Fataawa ash-Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-Ilm, p. 87-91</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How should he deal with the book? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dealing with the book involves several things:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowing the subject of the book – so that he can benefit from it, because he needs to specialize. It may be a book of sihr (witchcraft) or trickery or falsehood. So he has to know the subject of the book so that he can benefit from it.</li>
<li>He has to know its terminology. Because knowing the terminology means that you will save a lot of time. This is what the scholars do in the introduction to their books, for example we know that when the author of Buloogh al Maraam says “agreed upon”, he means that the hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, whereas the author of al-Muntaqaa uses this phrase in a different manner – when he says “agreed upon”, he means that the hadeeth was narrated by Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari and Muslim.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly in books of fiqh, the scholars use the words qawlayn, wajhayn, riwaayatayn and ihtimaalayn differently. Riwaayatayn (two reports) means two reports from the imaam; wajhayn (two views) means two views among the companions, i.e., the companions of the leaders of the madhhab; ihtimaalayn (two possibilities) is used in cases of uncertainty as to which of the two views is correct; and qawlayn (two opinions) is more general in meaning than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, we also need to know what an author means if he says ijmaa’ (consensus) or wifaaq (agreement). If he says ijmaa’, he means consensus among the ummah, and if he says wifaaq he means agreement with the three imams, as is the usage of the author of al-Furoo concerning Hanbali fiqh. Similarly the followers of each madhhab all have their own terminology, so it is essential to know the terminology of the author.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowing the style and phrases used in the book. Hence you will find that when you read a book for the first time, especially the academic books which are filled with knowledge, you will come across a phrase whose meaning you will have to ponder over, because you are not familiar with it. But if you read the book again you will become familiar with it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also something which needs to be added to the book, which is writing comments in the margins and at the foot of the pages. This is something which the seeker of knowledge needs to make the most of. If he comes across something which needs further explanation or evidence, and he is afraid that he may forget it, then he should make a note either in the margin or at the foot of the page. Often a person misses out on such benefits because he does not make notes which take no more than a minute or two to do. Then when he comes back he may or may not remember it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seeker of knowledge has to pay attention to that, especially in books of fiqh. In some books you may come across a matter and its rulings which causes you to be confused and have doubts. If you refer to books which are more comprehensive than the book you are reading and you find something which explains the matter, then you should make a note of it so that you can refer to it again if you need to, without having to refer to the original book from which you have quoted it. This will save you time.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Reading books is of two types</h5>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Reading in depth to ponder and understand. This necessarily takes time.</li>
<li>A quick reading to get an idea of the subject of the book, the topics covered and the content of the book. This is done by thumbing through the book and skimming it. This does not involve the same level of thinking as the first method. The best way to read books is to ponder the meanings and seek help from scholars who have understanding. It comes as no surprise that the book which is most deserving of such a reading is the Book of Allaah. You must be patient and persist in reading, for man has not been given any greater gift than patience.</li>
</ol>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Collecting books</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seeker of knowledge should be keen to collect books, but he should prioritize. If a person does not have much money, then it is not good and is not wise to buy a lot of books and have to pay for them, because this is bad management. If you cannot buy books with your own money, then you can borrow them from any library.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Being keen to read important books</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seeker of knowledge must be keen to read the most important reference books, not modern works, because some of the modern writers do not have deep knowledge, so if you read what they have written you will find that it is superficial. They may quote things verbatim, or they may distort them to make them longer, but it is all waffle. So you have to read the most important reference works written by the salaf (pious predecessors), because they are better and more blessed than many of the books of the later generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the books of the later writers are short on meanings but long-winded. You may read a whole page which could have been summarized in one or two lines. But you will find the books of the salaf to be easy, straight forward and well written, with not even one word that has no meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Among the best books that the seeker of knowledge must be keen to read are</strong> the books of Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah – rahimahullaah – and his student Ibn al-Qayyim – rahimahullaah. It is known that the books of Ibn al-Qayyim are easier, because the style of Ibn Taymiyyah is strongly-worded because of his abundant knowledge and alert mind, and Ibn al-Qayyim saw the knowledge of Ibn Taymiyyah as a well-built house, and his own role as that of organizing and adorning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Ibn al-Qayyim was free minded; if he thought that his shaykh’s view differed from what he thought was correct, he would speak up. When he thought that the pilgrim should go out of ihraam for Hajj then re-enter ihraam for ‘Umrah, because Ibn ‘Abbaas (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) thought that if the person who has not brought an animal for sacrifice enters ihraam for Hajj or Qiraan, he must go out of ihraam for Hajj then enter ihraam for ‘Umrah, whereas Ibn Taymiyyah thought that this applied only to the Sahaabah, he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am more inclined towards the opinion of Ibn ‘Abbaas than to the opinion of my shaykh.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He clearly stated that he was of a different view, so he was independent in his thinking. But it comes as no surprise that he followed his shaykh – rahimahullaah – in matters which he thought were true and correct. Undoubtedly if you think about most of the opinions of Ibn Taymiyyah you will find that they are correct. This is something which anyone who ponders his books will know.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Evaluating books</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Books may be divided into three types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Good books</li>
<li>Bad books</li>
<li>Books which are neither good nor bad.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Try to make sure that your bookshelf is free of books which have bad content. There are books which are described as literature, but they simply kill time without producing any benefit. And there are harmful books which contain specific ideas or promote incorrect ideology. These also should not be allowed on your bookshelf, whether that is because the methodology they use is wrong, or because of their wrong understanding of ‘aqeedah, and revolutionary books which promote a harmful ideology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, no harmful book should be allowed on your bookshelf, because books nourish the soul just as food and drink nourish the body. If you nourish it with books such as those it will cause you a great deal of harm and you will follow a methodology which goes against the methodology of the seeker of sound knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996<br />
Shaykh Abu Anas Hamad al-’Uthman [1].<br />
From An-Nubadh fî Âdâbit-Talabil-’Ilm (pp.61-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudayfah &#8211; <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhu</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh <em>sallallâhu </em> <i> ’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> related two matters to us. I have seen one of them, and I am waiting for the other. He informed us: <i> “Trustworthiness was sent down in the depths of the heart of the people, then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, and then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajr (825H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His saying: <i> “then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> So it occurs in this narration with the repetition of “then”, which contains an indication that they would learn Qur‘ân before learning the details of the <i>Sunnah</i>. And what is meant by the details of the <i>Sunnah</i> is anything that they would learn from the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; whether it was obligatory or recommended.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Maymûnî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abû ’Abdullâh (Imâm Ahmad) which is more beloved to you, that I should begin teaching my son the Qur‘ân or the Hadîth? He said: “No! The Qur‘ân.” I said: Shall I teach him all of it? He replied: “Unless that is difficult, in which case teach him some of it.” Then he said to me: “If he begins reciting first, then he will learn correct recitation and will persevere in it.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Muflih &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Upon this are the followers of Imâm Ahmad right up until our time.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for seeking to memorise the Qur‘ân, then this is to be given preference over many of the things that the people consider to be knowledge, but are &#8211; in reality &#8211; either totally useless, or having little benefit. It is also to be given precedence in learning especially by those who wish to acquire knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>, its principles and its particulars. Since what is prescribed for such a person at this time is that he should begin by memorising the Qur‘ân, as it is the foundation of the branches of the knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>. This is contrary to what is done by many of the people of Innovation from the non-Arabs and other than them, in that one of them will pre-occupy himself with superfluous parts of knowledge; such as <em>kalâm</em> (rhetorical speech) and argumentation; or very rare matters of differences; and blind-following; which there is no need for; or very strange and rare <i>ahadîth</i>, which are not established, nor of benefit; and many discussions which do not establish proofs. And he abandons memorising the Qur‘ân which is more important than all of this.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn al-Fadl said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I heard my grandfather say: I asked my father for permission to study under Qutaybah so he said: “First learn the Qur‘ân and then I will give you permission.” So I memorised the Qur‘ân by heart. So he said to me: “Remain until you have led the people in prayer with it (i.e for Tarawîh Prayer).” So I did so, then after the ’Îd he gave me permission, so I left for Marw.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul Barr (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Seeking knowledge is of levels and is of different stages which should not be skipped over. Whoever skips over them altogether, then he has overstepped the path of the Salaf &#8211; may Allâh have mercy on all of them. Whoever deliberately takes a path other than this has seriously deviated. However, whoever oversteps due to an <em>ijitihâd</em> (a knowledge based judgment that a qualified Scholar makes, intending to reach the truth), then such a person has erred. So the first knowledge is memorisation of the Book of Allâh and seeking to understand it. And it is obligatory to seek everything which will aid in understanding it. However, I do not say that is obligatory to memorise all of the Qur‘ân, but I do say that it is obligatory and essential for anyone who wishes to become a scholar &#8211; not that it is something obligatory in itself.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting for a student that he begins with the memorisation of the Book of Allâh &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>. Since it is the greatest of the branches of knowledge and that which should be placed first and given precedence.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâdfidh an-Nawawî (d.676H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first thing he should begin with is memorisation of the mighty Qur‘ân, which is the most important branches of knowledge. And the <em>Salaf</em> did not use to teach Hadîth or Fiqh, except to one who memorised the Qur‘ân. So when he has memorised it, then let him beware of pre-occupying himself from it with Hadîth, Fiqh or other things, to the extent that it leads him to forget anything of the Qur‘ân, or makes that likely.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge in Due Amounts</strong> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><strong>And this is a Qur‘ân which We have divided into parts, in order that you recite it to men at intervals. And we have sent it down in stages.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>said to ’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ</em>: “<i>Read the Qur‘ân in every month.” </i>I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Recite it in every twenty nights.”</i> I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Then recite it in every seven days and do not increase upon that.”</i> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <i>radiallâ</i><em>hu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ </em>also related from the Prophet <em>sallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>that he said: <i>“He does not understand the Qur‘ân who recites it in less than three days.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar ibn ’Abdul-Wâhid &#8211; a companion of al-Awzâ’î &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We read <i>al-Muwatta</i> to Mâlik (d.179H) in forty days, so he said: “A book that took me forty years to compile, you take from me in forty days! How little you understand of it.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting that he take care in acquiring knowledge and that he should not take too much in one go. Rather, he should take a little at a time, such that he can bear it, memorize it and be able to understand it. Because Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i>&#8211; says: <strong>“And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur‘ân not sent down to him all at once? Thus (is it sent down in parts) that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” </strong>[16]” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And know that the heart is an organ from the organs. It is able to bear some things and unable to bear others &#8211; just like the rest of the body. Thus, some people are able to carry one-hundred pounds, whereas others are unable to carry even twenty. Some people are able to walk a number of mites in a day without tiring, whereas others are unable to even walk a mile in a day before they become tired&#8230; So let each person limit himself to what he is able without expending all his energies, because that will better aid him in learning with a good mind, from a arm and proficient teacher.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Supplicating for an Increase in Knowledge</strong> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.</strong><strong>”</strong> [Sûrah Tâ Hâ 20:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anha </i>&#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to supplicate in the morning Prayer: <i>“O Allâh! I ask you for beneficial knowledge, righteous action and pure sustenance.” </i>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Atlas bin Mâlik &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anhu</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> supplicated: <i>“O Allâh! Benefit me with knowledge. Teach me that which will benefit me, and provide me with knowledge from which I can derive benefit.” </i>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr Muhammad ibn Ja’far said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l heard Ibn Khuzaymah (d.311H) being asked: From where did you acquire this knowledge? So he said: “Allâhs Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <i>“Zam-zam water is that for which it is drunk.” </i>[22] So when I drunk the Zam-zam water, I supplicated to Allâh for beneficial knowledge.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslâm Ibn Taymiyyah said: [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reality of this matter is that the servant differs in what he asks of knowledge and guidance, and of what he seeks to ask. So with remembrance of Allâh and turning towards Him, Allâh guides such a person &#8211; as He said &#8211; : <strong>“O My servants! All of you are misguided, except whomsoever I guide. So seek your guidance from Me.”</strong> [25] And as the Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to say: <i>“O Allâh! Lord of Jibrîl, Mikaîl and Israfîl. The Originator of the heavens and the earths. Knower of the Unseen and the apparent. You judge between Your servants in that which he differs. So guide me in that which I differ from the truth</i> &#8211; <i>by Your permission. Indeed, You guide whomsoever You please, to a path that is straight</i>.<i>”</i> [26]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
</span>Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of the booklet <b>“At-Ta’seel fee Talab-il-‘Ilm”</b> (Laying the Foundations for Seeking Knowledge). The source used for this translation was the Dar-ul-Imaam Ahmad 1st edition, 2005.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Originally, this treatise was a lecture the Shaikh once gave in a masjid. The talk was then transcribed and published as a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool discusses in detail nine fundamental principles with regard to seeking knowledge, which he puts together and backs up with proofs and evidences. Consequently, the treatise is divided into nine chapters and an introduction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This topic is extremely important since every Muslim is obligated to seek knowledge at one point in his life or another be it to implement the Islamic laws that are binding on him or to learn the fundamentals of his faith. So he must know that seeking knowledge has manners, etiquettes and guidelines, some of which have been touched upon by the author in this treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The supportive sciences, or what some scholars commonly call ‘The applied sciences’, such as the Arabic Language, the Science of Eloquence, the Science of Principles, Hadeeth Terminology, and the Sciences of the Qur’aan – a student of knowledge should acquire from these that which will enable him to actualize the primary objective, which is to properly worship Allaah – the reason for which we were created. And if this is not the case, then it falls under the realm of being from the extravagant forms of knowledge, and Allaah knows best. So it is not required from a student of knowledge studying Grammar that he becomes like Seebawaih, nor from one studying the Arabic Language that he becomes like Al-Khaleel and Al-Azharee, nor from one studying the Science of Eloquence that he becomes like Al-Jirjaanee!! Rather, it is sufficient for him to only learn from all of that what he needs to properly understand the Book and the Sunnah and to implement what Allaah has obligated upon him from worship.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Devil enters into the hearts of some people desiring to turn them away from knowledge based on the argument that one should leave off seeking knowledge until he first purifies his intention. This is a plot, scheme and deception of the Devil. Rather, it is upon a Muslim to continue and persevere in his search for knowledge, and to constantly re-evaluate his intention, as Sufyaan Ath-Thawree said: ‘I did not try to rectify anything that was more difficult upon me than my intention.’ And this is Sufyaan we are talking about, so it applies even more so for those other than him!! Therefore, one should not make this into something that diverts him away from seeking knowledge.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Disregarding the ahaadeeth and narrations of the Salaf while relying on just the language and intellect to understand the Qur’aan and Hadeeth is a method that has been embarked upon in recent times by the Orientalists. So when they need to research a narration, they simply quote from the books of Al-Jaahidh or from the book al-Aghaanee or from al-‘Aqd-ul-Fareed. And if quoting becomes hard on them, they just say: ‘This conforms to the intellect!’ Contrary to this, a Muslim who follows what the Prophet and his Companions were upon confines his comprehension and understanding of the Glorious Qur’aan and Prophetic Sunnah to conform to the understanding of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and doesn’t leave from their fold.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Student of Knowledge &amp; Books</strong><br />
<strong>طالب العلم والكتب</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Sālih bin Abdul-Azīz Āl us-Shaykh</strong><br />
<strong>الشيخ صالح بن عبد العزيز آل الشيخ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing &#8211; </span>Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small on-line booklet called: <b><i>“Taalib-ul-‘Ilm wal-Kutub”</i></b> [The Student of Knowledge and Books] which was originally a lecture delivered by Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and transcribed by a student of knowledge then made available for free on the internet in Arabic. The source used for this translation was the one found in <a href="http://www.sahab.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahab.org</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, the Shaikh discusses seven etiquettes that a Muslim, and in particular a student of knowledge, should abide by with regard to books. The author has done an excellent job in explaining these general guidelines and points.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this treatise comes at a crucial time since as the English speaking Muslims in the West increase so does the printed literature that they acquire to learn the fundamentals of their Religion, not to mention those who are able to read and collect books in Arabic. Therefore, such a discussion is necessary to provide guidance and advice on how to acquire, handle, preserve and use these religious books, which are being produced at an ever-increasing rate in recent times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this e-book in conjunction with the recently launch Classical Knowledge Series publications will provide the English readers with a solid basis on the basics and principles of knowledge in terms of seeking it, acquiring it, teaching it and propagating it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is well known that knowledge is acquired via two methods – either, <b><i>orally by way of hearing</i></b> and sitting with the people of knowledge and taking knowledge from them through listening with one’s ears or <b><i>by way of books</i></b>, and that is through researching, investigating and studying. The first way is the same method as the second way, whereas the correctness of the second method is based on the first. This is as one of the scholars said: ‘Knowledge used to be in the breasts of men then it transferred into the interior of books. However, its keys remained in the hands of men.’ This means that books possess a high level of importance to the student of knowledge. However, the only ones that can properly deal with these books and correctly understand them are those who establish themselves on the path of studying at the hands of the people of knowledge, mixing with them and comprehending what they meant by the words they recorded in these books.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first etiquette with regard to books is that one must organize his books in a good manner. Maintaining one’s library in order is an indication of a student of knowledge’s regard for his books. However, if you visit and are granted access to a person’s library and find that his books are scattered around, in disorder and so on, this is due to ether one of two possibilities. The books are this way either because (1) the person researches his books a lot and needs to refer to them, thus causing his books to be scattered about – and even though this is something praiseworthy he should still put them back in their proper places afterward – or (2) he does not organize his books at all to begin with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is one of the important etiquettes with regard to books – that you not turn them into storage bins such as by placing pens inside them or treating them like repositories for money and currency. So if you were to open up a book you would find all of these things inside them and notice that the book’s binding has become worn and that the book has changed and so on due to the book not being preserved properly. A book should also not be turned into a bouquet, i.e. it should not be folded in an inappropriate manner, since a book contains the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah. So it is not proper to treat a book in this manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Also from the etiquettes related to books is that one should make an effort to care for and reinforce their outer and inner parts as well as to keep them clean so that the books can be in a presentable condition that is befitting for others besides you. This is since when a student of knowledge buys a book, he must have or should we say it’s preferred for him to have two types of intentions. The first is that he should intend to benefit from it in order to free himself from ignorance. And secondly, he should intend that others benefit from the book as well – such as either his wife or his children. Afterward, the books can either remain with that person (in his family) or they can be donated after him. Or perhaps one can give them away to someone as a gift or sell them, and so on and so forth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:We would like some advice about the books which the seeker of Islamic knowledge should obtain, study and refer to</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p>Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Aqeedah (basic tenets of faith):
<ul>
<li>Shaykh al-Islam Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him).
<ul>
<li>Thalaathat al-Usool &#8211; The Three Fundamental Bases of Islamic Theology (pdf)</li>
<li>Al-Qawaa’id al-Arba’ah &#8211; Four Principles of Tawheed (pdf)</li>
<li>Kashf al-Shubahaat &#8211; Removal of Doubts ( pdf )</li>
<li>Al-Tawheed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.
<ul>
<li>Al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah (Principles of Islamic Faith ) which deals with Tawheed al-Asmaa’ wa’l-Sifaat
<ul>
<li>This is one of the best books written on this topic, and it is worth reading and studying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Hamawiyyah</li>
<li>Al-Tadmuriyyah &#8211; These two books are more comprehensive than al-Waasitiyyah</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Tahhaawiyyah
<ul>
<li>Al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, by Shaykh Abu Ja’far Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahhaawi</li>
<li>Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah by Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Abi’l-‘Izz</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Durar al-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajoobah al-Najdiyyah, compiled by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Qaasim</li>
<li>Al-Durrah al-Madiyyah fi ‘Aqeedah al-Firqah al-Mardiyyah by Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Safaareeni al-Hanbali. &#8211;
<ul>
<li>This book contains some general statements which go against the madhhab of the salaf, such as his saying, “Our Lord is not an essence or an attribute or a physical entity, exalted be He.” Therefore the seeker of knowledge has to study it with a shaykh who is well versed in the ‘aqeedah of the salaf, so that he can explain the general statements in it that go against the ‘aqeedah of the righteous salaf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadeeth
<ul>
<li>Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani</li>
<li>Subul al-Salaam Sharh Buloogh al-Maraam, by al-San’aani,
<ul>
<li>his book combines between hadeeth and fiqh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nayl al-Awtaar Sharh Muntaqaa al-Akhbaar by al-Shawkaani</li>
<li>‘Umdat al-Ahkaam by al-Maqdisi.
<ul>
<li>This is an abridged book; most of its ahaadeeth are narrated in al-Saheehayn so their authenticity does not need to be researched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Arba’een al-Nawawiyyah, by Abu Zakariyya al-Nawawi.
<ul>
<li>This is a good book because it includes etiquette and a good methodology, and important basic principles, such as the hadeeth, “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 1 – 201; al-Tirmidhi, 2318; classed as hasan by al-Nawawi in Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, 73; classed as saheeh by Ahmad Shaakir in al-Musnad, 1737). This principle – if one made it the path upon which one walks – would be sufficient.</li>
<li>Another principle is given concerning when one should speak, “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him say something good or else<br />
remain silent.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Adab; Muslim, Kitaab al-Luqtah, Baab al-Diyaafah).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buloogh al-Maraam, by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani.
<ul>
<li>This is a very useful book, especially because it mentions the narrators, and quoted the opinions of others scholars, who said whose hadeeth is saheeh and whose is da’eef, and he comments on the hadeeth to say whether they are saheeh or da’eef.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nukhbat al-Fikr by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani.
<ul>
<li>This is considered to be a comprehensive work. If the seeker of knowledge understands it completely then he will have no need of many other books of mustalah (the science of hadeeth). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) has a useful way of writing, which involves examining every issue in depth and categorizing the topics he discusses. If the seeker of knowledge reads it he will find it stimulating, because it is based on making one think. I say: it is good for the seeker of knowledge to memorize it because it is a useful summary of the science of mustalah (science of hadeeth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Six Books (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Sahih Muslim, al-Nasaa’i, Abu Dawood, Ibn Maajah and Tirmidhi).
<ul>
<li>I advise the seeker of knowledge to read them often, because that will serve two purposes: reviewing the main sources of Islam and reviewing the names of hadeeth narrators. If you often review the names of hadeeth narrators, then whenever you come across the name of one of the narrators of al-Bukhaari in any isnaad, you will know that this is one of the narrators of al-Bukhaari, so you will benefit from this knowledge of hadeeth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Books of fiqh
<ul>
<li>Aadaab al-mashiy ila’l-Salaah by Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab</li>
<li>Zaad al-Mustaqni’ fi Ikhtisaar al-Muqni’ by al-Hajjaawi.
<ul>
<li>This is one of the best texts of fiqh. It is a blessed book, brief and comprehensive. Our shaykh, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) told us to memorize it, even though he had memorized the text of Daleel al-Taalib.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Rawd al-Murbi’ Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqni’ by Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahooti</li>
<li>‘Umdat al-Fiqh by Ibn Qudaamah</li>
<li>Al-Usool min ‘Ilm al-Usool.
<ul>
<li>This is an abridged book which serves as an introduction for the seeker of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faraa’id (laws of inheritance)
<ul>
<li>Matn al-Rahbiyyah by al-Rahbi</li>
<li>Matn al-Burhaaniyyah by Muhammad al-Burhaani.</li>
<li>This is a useful and comprehensive abridged book dealing with all the laws of inheritance. I think that al-Burhaaniyyah is more comprehensive than al-Rahbiyyah in some ways, and it gives more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tafseer
<ul>
<li>Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem by Ibn Katheer
<ul>
<li>This book is good for tafseer based on reports and it is useful and trustworthy. But it does pay much attention to matters of grammar and style.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di
<ul>
<li>This is a good, easy and trustworthy book, and I recommend it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Muqaddimah Shaykh al-Islam fi’l-Tafseer.
<ul>
<li>This is an important introduction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adwaa’ al-Bayaan by al-‘Allaamah Muhammad al-Shanqeeti
<ul>
<li>This is a comprehensive book covering hadeeth, fiqh, tafseer and usool al-fiqh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General books on some subjects:
<ul>
<li>On (Arabic) grammar: &#8211;
<ul>
<li>Matn al-Ajroomiyyah. This is an abridged book.</li>
<li>Alfiyyah Ibn Maalik; this is a summary of the science of grammar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Seerah (Prophet’s biography)
<ul>
<li>Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211;
<ul>
<li>The best book that I have seen. This is a very useful book in which he mentions the biography of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from all angels, then he discusses many rulings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rawdat al-‘Uqalaa’ by Ibn Hibbaan al-Busti
<ul>
<li>This is a useful book despite its brevity. He compiled a large amount of useful material and stories of the scholars, muhadditheen and others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Siyar A’laam al-Nubalaa’ by al-Dhahabi.
<ul>
<li>This book is very useful and the seeker of knowledge should read and refer to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (rahimallah), Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 92</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Certainly there has appeared between the students of knowledge during this time, the taking of knowledge from those young in age. This phenomenon in reality is a cancerous disease and a chronic illness and it hinders the student of knowledge from his intent and turns him away the sound path that will connect him to knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because taking knowledge from those who are young in age; those who did not firmly establish their feet in knowledge, their beards did not become grey within it (they did not spend a long time with seeking knowledge) along with the presence of those older than them in age, whose feet are grounded, because of this the foundation of the beginner is weak. He is prevented from the benefit of the experience of the major scholars and attainment of their manners which is established by knowledge and time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences that give reason to this is the athar of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from their elders, their trusted and their scholars. If they (begin) taking knowledge from their sighaar and evil ones, then they are destroyed&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is the affirmed Hadeeth on the authority of Abi Umayyah al Jamhee, that the Messenger of Allaah ملس و هيلع الله ىلص said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;From the signs of the hour is when knowledge sought from al-asaagheer&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people have differed in relation to the explanation of the word: &#8220;as-sighaar&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is some speech which Ibn Abdul Barr (may Allaah have Mercy on him) mentioned in al-Jaami&#8217; and ash-shatibi (may Allaah have Mercy on him) mentioned in al-i&#8217;tisaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him) took the view that <span style="color:#0000ff;">as-sighaar are those who are young in age</span>. And he said regarding the athar of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He intended that the people will not cease to be upon good as long as their scholars are mashaayakh (old) and that their scholars are not young (in age), because the shaykh (elderly) has left the pleasure of youth, his temper, his hastiness, his foolishness and he prefers practice and experience and nothing doubtful enters into his knowledge, his desires do not overcome him and he is not tempted by lust or greed. Shaytan does not cause him to fall (but) causes the young to. The one with age has dignity, honor and prestige.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young maybe will enter into some of these affairs that the elderly is safe from. If these affairs enter into him and he makes a ruling (then) he is destroyed and destroys others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn abdul Barr reported that Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;I knew when the uprightness of the people (was present) and when they became corrupted. When (an issue) of fiqh came from the young (in age) the elderly turned away from following them. And when (an issue) of fiqh came from the elderly; the young followed them and they were both guided.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr also reported on the authority of Aboo Ahwas from Abdullah who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Certainly you will always remain upon good as long as knowledge is found in your elderly and when knowledge is found in your young, the young will make the elderly appear foolish.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two Athars are proofs for not taking knowledge from the young. Another besides which Ibn Qutaybah mentioned and it was fear of accepting knowledge if it came from the youth. At any rate, if its wording; as-sagheer is general (then) it is used in a way perceived and meaning (young in age).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ruling is not without exception regarding the young in age, since a group from amongst the companions and taabi’een used to give fataawa and teach during their youth in the presence of those old in age. Certainly it is rare to find the likes of these individual so what about anyone after them. If they (the young) were present and their uprightness was known and their knowledge was examined and its firmness was apparent and no one from amongst the elders were found, then whatever knowledge they (the young) had with them was taken and safe from fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajjaaj bin Ar-Taah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The people use to dislike that a man speak until grey was seen in his beard.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The intent is not that knowledge of the young should be abandoned in the presence of the old; no! The intent is only to put people in their proper places.</strong> </span>So the right of the intelligent young student is that he is benefited from in research, giving reminders and studies. As for putting him forward for giving rulings and questions being put forward to him the no! Certainly no! Because this will kill him and this is a fitna and deception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl ibn Iyaad said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“If you see a man gathering the people around him, then I say this (person) is crazy. What person gathers the people around him and does not like that they make good his speech” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It has reached me that the scholars of the past when they learned they acted, and when they acted they became busy,When they became busy they became lost (missing) and when they became lost they were sought (after) and when they were sought they fled &#8220;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O seeker of knowledge if you desire knowledge from its source (fountain) then, here are the major scholars, those whose beards have become grey and bodies have become frail and strength have become weak (being exhausted) in knowledge and learning. Their commitments are before their lost and they bring out their treasures before they pass away (along) with them. (As) in the darkness of the night the Badr (moon) passes away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>A point of attention: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During these times the standards have been greatly blemished by the common people regarding properly estimating the scholars. So every individual who can give an eloquent speech, or a meaningful lecture, or a Friday sermon haphazardly becomes a scholar. He then becomes someone returned to for rulings and knowledge is taken from him. This is a painful and apparent affliction which its evil is airborne and it harms is circulated. When the connection of knowledge is (connected) to other than its people and when the affair (are in the hands) of other than its people, then look for the hour (Day of Judgment)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the student must be warned of taking knowledge from these (types). Except if they are known to be from people who possess knowledge. Not everyone who has good expression is a scholar and not everyone who turns the people’s faces towards him with issues regarding the leaders of the Muslims or the mentioning of the death rate of aids and whatever is similarly to that is a scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Also) the meaning is not what has proceeded – as some understand it- ex. Not listening to them (the young in age) or not benefitting from their talks, No! The intent is only taking legislative knowledge from them and not raising them to the levels of the scholars and Allaah is the One Who gives success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We Hope to open this meeting O virtuous Shaykh with a question from one of the brothers who says: “Shaykh Sālih with what do you direct the students of knowledge or similarly the beginning students of knowledge and those who have begun and what are the books you advise they begin with, in their quest for knowledge and what is the reward for acquiring Islāmic knowledge?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the Name of Allāh, Ar-Rahmān Ar-Rahīm, and all praises are for Allāh the Lord of everything that exist may the salāt and salām be upon our Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, his family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This an important question and it is how one should seek knowledge and how the student of knowledge should begin and who knowledge should be sought from and what are the books one should begin with and what is the important type of knowledge from all the (different) studies of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say, and with Allāh is the success, without doubt seeking knowledge is an important affair. Allāh جل وعلا says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Know! That none has the right to be worshipped except Allāh, and ask for forgiveness of your sins and for the male and female believers”</span> (47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imām al-Bukhārī (May Allāh have mercy on him) said in his chapter <span style="color:#008000;">“Knowledge proceeds speech and action”</span>  then he mentioned this verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because if actions are not based upon knowledge, founded upon knowledge, then it is misguidance and tiring without benefit.Because the affair is like this it’s an obligation upon the Muslim to seek knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And this (knowledge) is categorized into two categories.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This first category ofKnowledge:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which the Muslims religion will not be established except by way of it and this is an individual obligation upon every Muslim, male and female.That he learns that which his religion will be established by it. His Belief, his Prayer, his Zakāt, his Fasting, his Hajj, the five pillars of Islām. It is a must that he learns them, how he performs them. What are the requirements of every action, what are the conditions for them to be accepted by Allāh سبحانه و تعالى (as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Actions are only by the intentions” Having sincere intentions “And every person will have that which he intends”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is obligatory upon every Muslim, an individual obligation upon (every) male and female and everyone who has reached the age of puberty, it is obligatory upon him that he begins with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Particularly with the affair of <strong>Creed</strong>, because it the <strong>foundation</strong> in which his actions are built upon. Action without knowledge is not accepted and actions (not built upon a sound) Creed are false actions and it will not benefit its doer, so if he begins with anything he begins with the Creed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allāh says) : <span style="color:#008000;">“Know! That none has the right to be worshipped except Allāh”</span> (47:19). This is Creed (mentioned in this verse) so he starts with knowledge of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after this he learns the rulings of the prayer which are compulsory upon him day and night, five times (a day) he knows its conditions, its pillars and its obligations and how he performs it, until (it is performed) in its legislative manner, so that Allāh will accept it from him (along) with him having a sincere intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns how to perform (pay) the Zakāt what are its conditions and what type of wealth which are obligatory (to be paid) regarding it and what is the amount obligatory (to be paid) on it, who are the one who it should be distributed to until it is performed in the manner demanded, because it coupled (paired together) with the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns how he should fast during the month of Ramadhān and what the conditions of fasting are, what nullifies it and what makes it defective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns how to make Hajj to the house al-Atīq and how he performs Hajj and Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must that he learns these affairs with details even if (he learns them) small portions (at a time) because all forms of worship has its small portions (in learning them). An individual beginning in his (studies) learns (these issues) with what is easy (while) returning to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This Second category of Knowledge:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he learns (that) which will aid him, he learns the <strong><span style="color:#008000;">r</span><span style="color:#008000;">ulings of transactions</span></strong> and this is from the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>second category of knowledge</strong></span>. This is what is obligatory upon some (but not every individual).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever has the ability to learn it then he does so to benefit himself and the Muslims. Also this is what relates to the study of transactions, judgments and inheritance, wills and endowments, the book of marriage and divorce, the book of crimes and punishments, the book of qadā (etc.) All these are collective obligations, where one establishes it in what suffices himself and the Muslims, then this remains a right for the Muslims (in general) a recommended act (of seeking this knowledge) an affirmed recommended act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must seek knowledge upon its known way, with the people of knowledge which Allāh has designed and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. So one does not seek knowledge except from its people, those known for it, he does not take knowledge from someone who claims [ المتعاال ] it or ignorant person الجاهال or the people of misguidance and deviation اهال الضالال و اننحافا but rather he takes knowledge from the people of knowledge who remain upright upon obedience (to Allāh) and worship and like this one take knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either in schools with a system of study, or centers or colleges, or at the hands of the scholars in the Masājid. These are the places for seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also he learns that which will aid him in <strong>fiqh</strong> and the remaining sciences (of knowledge) as what is called knowledge of علاء such as Arabic grammar, Arabic language, or balāgha and this is something necessary for a person to learn that which is from the sciences of Arabic language. That from grammar and the Arabic language, that which the Qur&#8217;ān al-Karīm was revealed in and this regulates his recitation of Qur&#8217;ān and he doesn’t make mistakes in (its recitation) and this is not possible except by learning (Arabic) grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also he learns knowledge of measuring that which is distributed from inheritance, (knowledge) of how categorize in issues and how to give everyone who has a right, his rights as Allāh legislated and this is what is called knowledge of hisāb (measuring). So he gains understanding in transactions and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And this without doubt requires from the individual two affairs:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First affair:</strong> Patience upon the length (of time) in learning and patience upon the difficulties in learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second affair:</strong> to act by what Allāh has taught him (what He has caused him to learn). There is a must that he works by what Allāh has taught him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And a third affair:</strong> that he teaches the people (as Allāh says): <span style="color:#008000;">“To obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious”</span> (9:122)  So he learns and then he teaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>misguided group</strong></span>, who says we are not in need of learning knowledge as it hinders you from actions, and what is intended is actions and they strive hard in worship and they leave knowledge which is its guide and guidance. These people are misguided people and their actions are misguided. And this is mentioned in surah al-Fātihah which we read in every raka’ah <span style="color:#008000;">“Guide us to the straight path &#8211; the path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your Favour, not of those who have evoked [Your] Anger or of those who went astray.”</span> (1:6-7) Those who (Allāh’s) favour has been placed upon them are those who combine between beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. They don’t just take knowledge only without action and they don’t take action without knowledge. And those who have earned (Allāh’s) anger are those who took knowledge and abandoned action as the Jews. And those who are astray are those who took action and they abandoned knowledge. Those who are acquainted with this are the Christians, those who worship Allāh upon ignorance and misguidance. In every unit of prayer you read this great ayah. <span style="color:#008000;">“Guide us to the straight path &#8211; the path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your Favour, not of those who have evoked [Your] Anger or of those who went astray.”</span> (1:6-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So contemplate it and work by it! And do not pay attention to those who abstain from seeking knowledge and are firm upon that.Do not pay attention to those who meet knowledge with ignorance without knowing its guidelines and regulations and causes people to go astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These affairs are from principles in seeking knowledge and it is a must that the Muslim knows them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which is the foundation is the intention, you seek knowledge with a good intention (i.e. for Allāh only) because seeking knowledge is worship and it is a must that the worship have an intention as the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, <span style="color:#008000;">“Actions are only by the intentions and every individual will have that which he intends”</span></p>

<p>The questioner says:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">It has spread amongst the students of knowledge, i.e. the taking (of hair) from ones beard, so some advice is desired.</span></p>
<p>Ash-Shaykh Al-`Allaamah <strong>Salih Al-Fawzaan</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They are not students of knowledge nor scholars, the ones that take (hair) from the beard are not students of knowledge, the students of knowledge are the ones that act upon the Sunnah, and the Sunnah is to leave the beard, the one that takes from his beard is not from the students of knowledge! Yes.</span></p>

Translated by: Ehsaan Manzoor</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is taken from : <span style="color:#993300;">Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 2&gt;Volume 11: Jihad&gt;Miscellaneous Fatwas&gt;Al-Kitab Al-Jami`&gt;Trimming the ends of one&#8217;s beard</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 20317</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q 3: Trimming the beard prevailed among the Multazims (practicing Muslims) youth, as you see them trimming the ends from time to time. Perhaps they belong to religious parties, thus they become an example for the common people to follow. They may rely on weak narrations or some sayings attributed to Ibn `Umar, as well as growing the beard until it reaches the length of the fist.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Sahih (authentic) Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) indicate the necessity of letting the beard grow as it is, in addition to prohibiting cutting, shortening or trimming it. In this regard, Al-Bukhari and Muslim related in their &#8220;Sahih (Authentic Hadith Book)&#8221; about Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Trim closely the moustache, and let the beard grow to be contradictory to the unbelievers. It is mentioned in another narration by Al-Bukhari: Trim closely the moustache, and let the beard grow to be contradictory to the unbelievers. Muslim related in his &#8220;Sahih&#8221; from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah is reported to have said: Trim closely the moustache, and grow beard, and thus act against the fire-worshippers. There are other authentic Hadiths in this respect, but the mentioned ones are enough In sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills). The great scholar Abu Muhammad Ibn Hazm is reported to have said: &#8220;The scholars agreed thattrimming closely the moustache and growing the beard are Fard (obligatory, based on a definitive text)&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the previous Hadiths indicate that it is obligatory to let the beard grow and it is unlawful to cut, shorten or trim it, as the principle in commands is the obligation and the principle in the prohibition is declaring something unlawful. It is not permissible to turn it away from its principle and form except by a valid evidence and proof that can be relied on. There is no evidence or proof against this command. Thus, every Muslim should obey the command and follow the pattern of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) because he had a thick beard, as it was authentically reported about him. It was not reported about any of his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), who are the best of all people, that he used to trim his beard except what is reported by `Abdullah ibn `Umar He related that the Messenger of Allah trimmed the part of his beard that exceeds his fist at the time of Hajj. We can not rely on this act with the verification of the authentic Hadiths. `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) related that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Trim closely the moustache, and let the beard grow to be contradictory to the unbelievers. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The principle of the evidence is the narration of the relater not his acts and Ijtihad (juristic efforts to infer expert legal rulings). The scholars said that the authentic narration of the Sahabah and their successors about the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the supporting evidence, and it is more reliable than the relater&#8217;s opinion if his opinion contradicts the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). In this case, we rely on his narration of the Sunnah not of his act upon the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the narration of Al-Tirmidhy that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) &#8220;used to trim the length and width of his beard&#8221;, it is not only a weak Isnad (chain of narrators)of Hadith,but it is also Batil (false) and rejected. This is not authentically known about the Prophet (peace be upon him). As this Hadith is related by `Umar ibn Harun Al-Balkhy, who is Matruk (a narrator whose Hadith transmission was discarded due to unreliability) and accused of lying, this Hadith cannot be taken as evidence. Thus, the acts of these youth should not be followed. However, they and all of the Muslims should obey the commands of the Prophet (peace be upon him), avoid disobeying him, or imitating the enemies of Allah and His Messenger and avoid imitating women. A human being should be a good pattern in his sayings and actions. It is necessary to advise those who breach the commands of Allah and His Messenger, urging them to obey Allah and His Messenger and to avoid their prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Alifta.net &#8211; Fatwa no. 17929</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the final Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta</strong>&#8216; has read the letter which was sent to his Eminence, the Grand Mufty, from the questioners, Chairman and Members of Association of Islamic law at the Faculty of Shari`ah and Islamic Studies at the university of Kuwait. This letter was transferred to the Committee by the Secretariat-General of the Council of Senior Scholars under the number 1202 in 11/03/1416 A. H. The questioners asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible that a male teacher teaches female students without there being a screen between them so that they see each other? It may be important to mention that mostly the teacher does not see their faces as they wear the face veil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible that a female student attends the office of her male teacher and the latter talks with her without there being a screen between them but mostly without seeing her face? Is it permissible that such a student takes a seat inside the office of a male teacher speaking with him about the field of study and so on, while no Mahram (spouse or permanently unmarriageable relative) accompanies her or she is accompanied by one of her female schoolmates and the teacher explains the lesson to them or answers their questions which are related to lectures and so on? It may be worthy to mention that the foregoing can be done by phone and that some of the teachers are still in their youth or have just started their old age while the female students are mostly in the beginning of their youth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Committee had studied the question it answered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, intermixing of men and women in schools or any other places is considered a great Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Shari`ah and Muslims of sound intellect) and a great evil with regard to the affairs of both Din (religion) and the world. Thus,<span style="color:#ff6600;"> it is not permissible for women to study or work in a place which intermixes men and women</span>. Similarly, their guardians should not allow them to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;">it is neither permissible for men to teach unveiled women nor to teach women wearing Shar`y (Islamically acceptable) veil in privacy.</span> By the way, all of the body of a woman is `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered) as far as a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) is concerned. As for covering the head and showing the face, this is not full Hijab (veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;">it is permissible for a man to teach women from behind a screen in female schools where there is no intermixing of male and female students or male and female teachers</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If female students need to ask their male teacher about something, this should be done through closed communication networks, which are renowned and available, or via phones, however, such students should be careful not to soften their speech.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Imaam Abu Muhammad al Barbahaaree</strong> (d. 329 H rahimahullaah), said in his Sharh Us-Sunnah :</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allaah have mercy upon you! Examine carefully the speech of everyone you hear from in your time particularly. So do not act in haste and do not enter in anything from it until you ask and see: <strong>Did any of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allaah’s praise and salutations be upon him, speak about it, or did any of the scholars?</strong> So if you find a narration from them about it, cling to it, do not go beyond it for anything and do not give precedence to anything over it and thus fall into the Fire.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">In Explanation to the above <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong> (haafidthahullaah) mentioned :</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">Do not be hasty in accepting as correct what you may hear from the people especially in these later times.  As now there are many who speak about so many various matters, issue rulings and ascribing to themselves both knowledge and the right to speak. This is especially the case after the emergence and spread of new modern day media technologies. Such that everyone now can speak and bring forth that which is in truth worthless; by this meaning words of no true value – speaking about whatever they wish in the name of knowledge and in the name of the religion of Islaam.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">It has even reached the point that you find the people of misguidance and the members of the various groups of misguidance and deviance from the religion speaking as well. Such individuals have now become those who speak in the name of the religion of Islaam through means such as the various satellite television channels. Therefore be very cautious!</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you O Muslim, and upon you O student of knowledge individually, to verify matters and not rush to embrace everything and anything you hear.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to verify the truth of what you hear, asking, ‘Who else makes this same statement or claim?’, ‘Where did this thought or concept originate or come from?’, ‘Who is its reference or source authority?’</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">Asking what are the evidences which support it from within the Book and the Sunnah? And inquiring where has the individual who is putting this forth studied and taken his knowledge from? From who has he studied the knowledge of Islaam?</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">Each of these matters requires verification through inquiry and investigation, especially in the present age and time. As it is not every speaker who should rightly be considered a source of knowledge, even if he is well-spoken and eloquent, and can manipulate words captivating his listeners.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">Do not be taken in and accept him until you are aware of the degree and scope of what he possesses of knowledge and understanding. As perhaps someone’s words may be few, but possesses true understanding, and perhaps another will have a great deal of speech yet he is actually ignorant to such a degree that he doesn’t actually possess anything of true understanding. Rather he only has the ability to enchant with his speech so that the people are deceived. Yet he puts forth the perception that he is a scholar, that he is someone of true understanding and comprehension, that he is a capable thinker, and so forth. Through such means and ways, he is able to deceive and beguile the people, taking them away from the way of truth. Therefore what is to be given true consideration is not the amount of the speech put forth or that one can extensively discuss a subject. Rather the criterion that is to be given consideration is what that speech contains within it of sound authentic knowledge, what it contains of the established and transmitted principles of Islaam.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">As perhaps a short or brief statement which is connected to or has a foundation in the established principles can be of greater benefit than a great deal of speech which simply rambles on, and through hearing you can’t actually receive very much benefit from.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;">This is the reality which is present in our time; one sees a tremendous amount of speech which only possesses within it a small amount of actual knowledge. We see the presence of many speakers yet few people of true understanding and comprehension.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad ibn Bazmool</strong><br />
Transcription by: Umm Yusuf min Sri Lanka</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh <em>hafidhahullah</em> then stated that this issue of knowing merely the groups and the likes is a very important subject. It is taken from the statement of Muhammad ibn Sareeh <em>rahimahullah</em> this is a matter or this <strong><span style="color:#993300;">knowledge is a matter of <em>deen</em>, so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from</span></strong>. This matter is a matter of <em>deen</em>, so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from. So this is how important this issue is. Is that the knowledge when o­ne takes from someone or o­ne hears from someone or o­ne learns from someone that knowledge is going to be <em>deen</em> something that is going to weighty o­n the Day of Judgment something that he is going to meet Allaah with so it is important that he takes his knowledge o­nly from those who are known to have knowledge. And who are known to have <em>taqwa </em>and who are known to be upon righteousness, because what he takes is going to be his path to the Hereafter so look to who you take your <em>deen</em> from means that a Muslim must look and takes his <em>deen</em> from <em>Ahlus sunnah</em>, the <em>salafiyoon</em> the o­nes who follow the <em>salaf us salih</em> and secondly that the o­ne that he takes his <em>deen</em> from is someone who has knowledge, known for knowledge, known for being upright and known for having <em>taqwa</em>. This knowledge is a matter of <em>deen</em> so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> stated that Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> mentions in the introduction of Saheeh Imaam Muslim that there was <span style="color:#993300;">in Madinah a hundred men that were pointed to by the people as being worshippers and being people who were righteous and being people having abstinence from the <em>dunya</em> but no o­ne would take knowledge from them</span>. This statement by Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> is saying, that it is not enough for a person to be known for worship and being known for having abstinence from the <em>dunya</em> and being known for the outward expression of his worship that you take from him. That these people were known for that and these people pointed to them for that but no o­ne would take their affairs from them because it was not from their affair. Their affair was worshipping and righteousness but their affair was not knowledge. <span style="color:#993300;">He said that if we would understand that any of us who would see a brother who has his <em>thobe</em> properly clad and the length of his beard is long we would think that he is a scholar of his time of the mufti of his area and this is a great mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> states that there is no doubt that is obligatory upon the people to learn <em>ilmi shar&#8217;ee</em>, Islamic knowledge and this is based o­n the Quraanic verse, Allaah <em>subhana wata&#8217;alah</em> says &#8220;Ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.&#8221; And it is based upon the statement of Prophet Muhammad salallahu alaihi wa sallam &#8220;that seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim&#8221;. And a man came to Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> and said, &#8220;I want to seek knowledge&#8221; and Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> told him <span style="color:#993300;">start with that which you needfor your night and your day</span> because he means that the areas of knowledge are many and extensive and what is important is what you need is for your night and your day. And of course the first thing that you need is <strong>Tawheed</strong>, because it is the basis for all actions. And then you need <strong><em>taharah</em> </strong>the proper way to purify yourself and then you need the proper manner of how to make <strong><em>salaah</em> </strong>and like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is understood and this has been explained, it is clear that that man needs what he needs for his day and his night of <em>Tawheed </em>and of <em>taharah</em> purification of <em>salaah</em>. Then we can see the mistake of those who want that the Muslims get involved or start without knowledge in <strong><em>siyaasah</em> or political issues</strong> upon the methodology of the <em>hizbiyyah</em> or partisanship or defending the people who are upon <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid&#8217;ah</em>. We see that these people who call to these types of issues are not individuals from whom we should take are knowledge from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> then went o­n to say that in reality the <strong>weakness of this <em>ummah</em> and the humiliation of this <em>ummah</em></strong> is because of the ignorance of the <em>ummah</em> regarding this <em>deen</em>. It is not like some people say that the weakness of the <em>ummah</em> is because it does not have the physical strength or the weakness of the <em>ummah</em> is due to the fact that the disbelievers are conspiring against it. The shaykh says no, <strong>the weakness of the ummah is from inside the ummah, that the ummah does not have knowledge of deen</strong> . This <em>ummah</em> does not support Allaah so Allaah does not support it. As Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8220;If you support Allaah, Allaah will support you and will make your foothold firm. He said that the scholars say, that supporting Allaah means learning the <em>deen</em>, the <em>ahkam</em> the regulations of the <em>deen</em>, acting upon the <em>deen</em> and studying the <em>deen</em>. He says it is not like those people think that what we need to do is concentrate o­n the materialistic issues and if we knew about the strategies and conspiracies of the disbelievers and their political plans and we had a system arranged with all sort of leaders and the like that that will solve our problems. He said no, it is clear that humiliation comes from ourselves. Based o­n the <em>hadith</em> of Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wa sallam</em> that if you deal in <em>eena</em> which is an illegal transaction a form of usury which means a Muslim will enter into which is forbidden regarding transaction and you follow the tails of the cows meaning will give in to agriculture and these type of issues and get them more importance than the Hereafter and you leave <em>Jihaad</em> neither do you establish <em>Jihaad</em> nor do you for <em>Jihaad</em> for <em>Jihaad</em> he said has two types of preparations <strong><em>Roohi wa Maddi</em></strong>, <em>Roohi</em> meaning spiritual preparation and <em>Maddi</em> meaning material preparation. And this is why you see the mistake of Usaamah bin Laden among many reasons for his mistakes he is wrong and incorrect is he thinks that <em>Jihaad</em> is o­nly the materialistic preparation and he has totally forgotten about the spiritual preparation and he has totally forgotten about many issues in Islaam. And that which he is doing is nothing to do with the <em>sunnah</em> and which he is doing has nothing to do with Islaam and he is in ignorance of these issues and the scholars have responded against him. So it is the issue that the Muslims, the <em>ummah</em> will not learn the <em>deen</em> and will get involved in <em>tijaarah</em> and forbidden trading transaction and will leave <em>Jihaad</em> and will become pleased with the <em>dunya</em>, then Allaah <em>subhana wata&#8217;alah</em> will send upon him humiliation. And He will not lift this humiliation off from them until they return to their <em>deen</em>. The scholars say return to the <em>deen</em> is learning the <em>deen</em>, acting upon the <em>deen</em> and spreading the <em>deen</em>. He says it is not through explosions and bombings and harming individuals who had no hand in any evil and this type of thing but it is returning to the <em>deen</em> of Allaah learning it, practicing it and spreading it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> went o­n to say so we know and understand this. There is a very important point that we must understand and that is that <strong>it is forbidden for anyone who does not have knowledge to talk</strong>. That is if he is <em>jaahil </em>ignorant is forbidden to talk in the matters of the <em>deen</em><span style="color:#339966;">. </span>And this is something very clear from the Qur&#8217;aanic verses in which Allaah says, &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">Do not talk about those matters which you have no knowledge, verily regarding the hearing, the heart and the talk all of these matters a person will be questioned about.</span>&#8221; And then Allaah <em>subhana wata&#8217;alah</em> mentions the forbidden matters after mentioning <em>al fawaahish</em> outwardly and inwardly and mentioning other matters and He says and to ascribe to Allaah that which he has no authority or that you commit shirk and then He says and you speak about Allaah when you have been forbidden that you speak about Allaah when you have no knowledge. He said that the scholars have got from this that speaking about Allaah without knowledge is worse than shirk. Speaking about Allaah without knowledge is worse than shirk, for two reasons o­ne is that this speaking about Allaah <em>tabarakta wat&#8217;ala</em> without knowledge is something that is general something that it will affect everybody but the state of the something he has done regarding himself. So it is forbidden for anyone to speak about Allaah without knowledge. And there is the narration of the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wa sallam</em> in which some of his companions was with o­ne of his companions o­n a journey and he got injured and when he got injured he also fell into sexual defilement, state of <em>junub</em> and it was a very dark cold night and he wanted to know if he should take wudhu or <em>tayammum</em> and he asked them if it is possible to do this and they said no you must take a ghusl you must take a full <em>ghusl</em>, so when he did this, he died. So when this reached the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wa sallam </em>he said, &#8220;they killed him they killed him, may Allaah kill them. Why did they not ask if they were ignorant? Verily the cure for ignorance, is asking.&#8221; So this shows that it is forbidden for someone who does not know, to talk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah </em>says if we have understood from what has preceded, the o­ne being questioned if he does not know, if he cannot answer it is <em>haraam</em> for him to answer. He must also know that<strong> the Muslim who does not know it, is forbidden for him to ask someone who does not know</strong>. It is forbidden for him in matters of <em>deen</em> to ask someone who does not know. Rather he has to ask an <em>aalim</em> a scholar someone who has knowledge and this is what Muhammad ibn Sar&#8217;ee rahimahullahu meant when he said this matter is a matter of knowledge of <em>deen</em> so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said also in our daily life we had a medical situation or whatever, will we go to a mechanic ?, and if we had a problem with our car will we go to a farmer? and if we wanted to construct a house will we go to someone who is a specialist in cleaning?. No, we will go to each individual who has a specialty in which they are specialist in. So when it comes to an issue of <em>deen</em> we must go to the <em>ulemaa</em> we must go to the scholars. <strong>And it is not right to say ask anybody or to do what everybody else is doing this is a major mistake also</strong>. As comes in a narration of Abu Darda <em>raliallahu anhu </em>in this in the khilafa of Uthmaan raliallahu anhu in the time of Uthmaan <em>raliallahu anhu</em> when he went to the <em>masjid</em> and he prayed and he saw some <em>tabi&#8217;een</em> praying but they were not praying according to the <em>sunnah</em>. There <em>salaah</em> was not the <em>salaah</em> according to the <em>sunnah</em>. Abu Darda went home angry. And when Umm Darda <em>raliallahu anha</em> saw him she said, &#8220;What has made you angry, what has caused you to get angry.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allaah I don&#8217;t see anything that we were doing in the time of the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> that the Muslims are doing except that they pray together. Meaning that many of the <em>sunan</em> many of the practices that they were doing in the time of the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam </em>that individuals were not doing it and what was left was that they were just praying together. This is Abu Darda&#8217;s statement while he is at the period which is close to the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> and there were a lot of <em>sahabahs</em> still alive and there were many <em>tabi&#8217;een</em> so what about now o­ne thousand four hundred years after that are the people the general masses upon <em>sunnah</em>? Are the general masses upon knowledge? Are the general masses people that we should follow? No! but we should follow the <em>ulemaa</em> <em>Rabbaniyeen</em>, the scholars who know the <em>deen</em> of Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> <strong>we should not follow what our mothers were upon our fathers were upon our relatives are upon but we should follow that which the scholars are upon</strong>. These people are not right that they follow the general masses but we should follow the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> and the o­ne who directs us to the right. In fact what the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> was upon are the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah </em>stated that the <strong>people are of two types</strong>. The <em>awwam</em> or the general laymen who have no knowledge and the <em>tullabul ilm,</em> <em>al ulemaa</em> they are together, <em>tullabul ilm</em> students of knowledge and the <em>ulemaa</em>. Now the <em>ulemaa</em> and the students are of two types. The <em>ulemaa</em> who are not in reality scholars and those are the o­nes who have <em>hizbiyyah</em> or innovation or partisanship or politics or this movement oriented overthrowing governments and blowing up things and things of this nature and <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> and mistakes in their <em>aqeedah</em> and their <em>manhaj</em>. These individuals should never be taken from whatsoever. The second is the <em>tullabul ilm</em> and the <em>ulemaa</em> who are upon the <em>sunnah</em>, <em>salafiyeen</em> upon the way of the <em>salaf us saalih</em> . They are upon the way of the <em>sunnah</em> and o­n the way of the <em>salaf us saalih</em>. These individuals the scholars are the source that you go to. The students of knowledge are actually made a (unclear ) source. They are individuals that you benefit from but you are never to take their statements over the statements of the <em>ulemaa</em>, of the scholars. So if we reiterate this point, the<em> awwam</em> the general masses don&#8217;t take anything from them but rather they should be taught, for they are ignorant.And those people who are considered scholars but their methodology is incorrect, their a <em>qeedah</em> and <em>manhaj</em> is incorrect they are involved in <em>siyasah</em> or politics or <em>hizbiyyah</em> or matters that are secretive and things of this nature they should not be taken from for they are in reality they are part of the seventy two groups that are promised the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the o­ne that should be taken from are the <em>tullabul ilm</em> and <em>ulemaa</em> who are upon the <em>sunnah </em>and who are upon the way of the <em>salaf us saalih</em>. But the distinction must be made that <strong>we take the words of the<em> ulemaa</em> over the words of the student of knowledge</strong>. For instance <em>Kibar ulema</em>a the Great body of Scholars like Shaykh Rabee for example says something then we take what he has said and what they have said because they are the greater scholars. And it is not right to take what a student of knowledge says just because he is <em>salafee</em> unless he has some clear evidence that he has stated that the scholars have missed. But if generally speaking the people have of taking the students of knowledge because he is <em>salafee</em> over the scholars is a great mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah </em>said this issue of importance of returning to the people of <em>ilm </em>, returning in going to the people of knowledge as a source in going back to them we have two stories from the Prophet Muhammad salallahu alaihi wasallam regarding this issue. o­ne is the story regarding the <strong>man from before us from <em>Bani Israel</em> who had killed 99 individuals</strong> and he wanted to get to Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> so he found an <em>aabid</em> a worshipper, he said notice an <em>aabid</em> a worshipper not an <em>aalim</em> a scholar. A worshipper who was worshipping in seclusion and he said to him, &#8220;I have killed 99 individuals, is there any means for me to repent to Allaah to make Taubah&#8221;. So this <em>aabid</em> who was ignorant said, &#8220;No&#8221;. So he killed him and he completed a hundred individuals. So then he went to a scholar and saying to the scholar I have killed a hundred individuals is there any means for me to repent. The <em>aalim</em> said what is(unclear)between you and making <em>Taubah</em> to Allaah. Of course you can make <em>taubah</em> but you are in a land that is evil and it is upon you to go to such and such land where there are righteous people who worship Allaah so you go there and worship Allaah with them.&#8221; So this shows you the issue of going to the scholar verses going to someone who is ignorant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second story</strong> is about two individuals, o­ne who was righteous and the other was a sinner. And every time the righteous o­ne would pass by the sinner he would correct him and advice him but he would not accept. So o­ne day the righteous person said to him, &#8220;By Allaah, Allaah will not forgive you.&#8221; So Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la </em>said, &#8220;Who is it who is bold enough to go over Me or above Me, verily I have forgiven him and I have made your deeds nothing.&#8221; So this is the righteous person because he was ignorant he led him to go into the area that was described by Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> that he would not forgive o­ne of His creatures. So Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> wiped away or made nothing the deeds of the obedient o­ne and forgave the disobedient o­ne. So this shows us the importance of knowledge number o­ne and that we should acquire it and the importance of returning to the <em>ulemaa</em>. Don&#8217;t ask anyone and everyone but ask <em>Raazikeena fil ilm</em> those who are well grounded in knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In closing Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah</em> that someone might say <strong>what is wrong with taking knowledge from the <em>hizbiyeen </em>and <em>mubtadiyah </em>(One who commits bid&#8217;ah)</strong>, if they have something beneficial to give. I&#8217;ll just take the good and I will leave the bad. He said there were several issues wrong with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o­ne, is that the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> warned against the <em>ulemaa</em> <em>as soo or al jahaal</em>, taking from the evil scholars or the ignorant. And this is in a <em>hadith</em> in which he said, &#8220;That Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la </em>does not take the knowledge after having given it by taking it away from your hearts but by the death of the religious learned men, the scholars, until there will remain nothing but the ignorant people who will contort it and will give verdicts according to their opinions and they will mislead others and they will go astray and will lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second matter is that Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> and the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em>&#8216;s order of <em>hizbudeen </em>, preserving o­nes <em>deen</em>. And the person who goes and sits with the innovator or <em>hizbee</em> is not preserving his <em>deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly, is that taking from the <em>hizbiyeen</em> or the innovators is that they are from the <em>asaaghir</em>, the small o­nes and we have been forbidden or the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> indicated that from the signs of the hour is that the people will take their knowledge from the <em>asaaghir</em>. And he said that the <em>asaaghir</em> are the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourthly is that the <em>mubtadih</em> you cannot forsake from the fact that he will not oppose you. You will think that he is giving you the best, but he will take you step by step until he pulls you and that is the way it has been amongst the past (unclear).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fifth matter is that the person who is going there saying &#8220;I will get the good and leave the bad&#8221; is ignorant. So he cannot protect himself from falling into a fitnah. So he can&#8217;t protect himself from falling into a fitnah. So for all these reasons above and more it is important that you take o­nly from the scholars who are known for the knowledge who are well grounded in their knowledge and we do not ask or take from anyone else. And then he said hadha wa salallahu wa nabiyinah Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Why the people who seek knowledge today don&#8217;t find the success with their knowledge and great benefit with their knowledge ?<br />
The Student of Knowledge Today in Comparison to Those of Yesterday<br />
Lecture by <span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Muhammed Ibn Haadee al-Madhkhaalee</span> [hafidahullaahu ta&#8217;aala]<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator&#8217;s Introduction:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In shaa Allaahu ta&#8217;aala were giving a very praiseworthy lecture by Shaykh Muhammed Ibn Haadee al-Madhkhaalee [hafidahullaahu ta&#8217;aala] ad-Doctor from Jazaan. He did a beautiful lecture [about 2 weeks ago] entitled: Seeking Knowledge In Our Time &amp; Seeking Knowledge In The Time That Was Before Us. After listening to this lecture; me, myself as the translator, I wanted to say that this has really changed my life, just since I heard this lecture. It had a tremendous effect in my life. So much so, that I just had to share it with the people, so that hopefully it will have an effect on our life or on your life, as it had an effect on my life. Or perhaps even have a greater effect on the lives of those who are listening, than it even had upon me and is continuously having upon me to this very moment right now; walhamdulillaah. The Shaykh &#8211; as a synopsis or the introduction &#8211; to what he talked about in his lecture, so you know what to look for, which is the reason why we entitled it online, the title we gave. Which is, the Shaykh he really talks about <strong>why the people who seek knowledge today don&#8217;t find the success with their knowledge and great benefit with their knowledge </strong>in their lives, and upon themselves, and everyone around them. As we seen, when knowledge was sought by those Imams, those `kibaar al-Ulamaa who just recently died &amp; those that still remain, and the strong students of knowledge; how we see knowledge effect them. So in this lecture the Shaykh, he&#8217;s going to explain why we don&#8217;t find success.<strong> And he breaks it down to 4 main reasons. </strong>In which he&#8217;s going to give them first and then he&#8217;s going to explain each 4 of those reasons. And his lecture in Arabic was a total 1 hour &amp; 10 minutes. With the questions and answers, it added another 33 minutes, but were not going to include, with this, the questions and answers. Were just going to include the lecture. And in shaa Allaahu ta&#8217;aala were going to translate this and hopefully with the success of Allaah subhannah wa ta&#8217;aala. And that Allaah, with the success lies &amp; to Him I seek assistance and to Him I return to in repentance. So in shaa Allaahu ta&#8217;aala, this is basically what the Shaykh talked about&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture of Shaykh Falaah Ismaeel (حفظه الله) was recorded on Tuesday, February 08, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture the Shaykh covered everything in regards with following the Salaf. He mentioned that we should follow the Salaf in their Aqeedah (creed), Ibadaat (acts of worship), Ikhlaaq (good manners), Mua’mulaat, and in everything. He mentioned many stories and one of the stories was about one of the Student of Knowledge (حفظه الله).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said &#8211; &#8220;I met one Student of Knowledge about 30 years ago when he was studying in Madinah (Saudi Arabia). We used to live together and sit with Ulemah. He was a very good student, he was excellent in the first year, excellent in the second, and in the third year but when the forth year started, he came to me and told me that he would like to go back to his home country (United Kingdom). Everybody asked him that why you want to leave, you are almost there, finish your education, get your degree, and then leave. He began to cry and said that he got a phone call from his family member and they told him that his father is very sick and he is in the hospital and the family is afraid that he may die (upon kufr). We told him that your father may not die, a lot of people go to the hospital but not everyone dies immediately. But he said that something in my heart telling me to leave. So he got on the plane and went back and didn’t finish the forth and last year of the University&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said that he didn’t care about the degree. He was truthful with Allah as related to guiding his father to Al-Islam and Allah was truthful with him as well. He went back and after a couple of days, we talked to him and he said alhamdulillah my father has accepted Islam. He said that alhamdulillah my father died upon Islam in the same hospital. The Shaykh said I visited him after many years and he said that now my mother is Muslim and my whole family is Muslim. <strong>The Shaykh said what we learn from this story that if you really care about your family and they are non Muslims, then focus your time and do what you can, the success is with Allah </strong><strong>(سبحانه وتعالى). </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is your reply to philosophers who give reason preference over religious texts?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The function of reason with regard to the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah is to understand and accept them. Reason has no role in religion except for this. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a lot of religious texts that make it obligatory for Muslims to follow the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah. Also, such texts warn Muslims against offering any opinions or suggestions that may oppose what is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted) says,(Surah Al-Hujurat, 49: 1)<span style="color:#008000;"> O you who believe! Make not (a decision) in advance before Allýh and His Messenger (peace be upon him), and fear Allýh. Verily, Allýh is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (may He be Praised) says,(Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 3) <span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord (the Qur&#8217;aan and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah), and follow not any Auliyý (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allaah), besides Him (Allaah). Little do you remember!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says,(Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 31) <span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad peace be upon him to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Islaamic Monotheism, follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says,(Surah Al-An`am, 6: 153) <span style="color:#008000;">And verily, this (i.e. Allaah&#8217;s Commandments) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqýn (the pious).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) also says,(Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 59) <span style="color:#008000;">And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) if you believe in Allýh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (may He be Exalted) says,(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 170) <span style="color:#008000;">When it is said to them: &#8220;Follow what Allaah has sent down.&#8221; They say: &#8220;Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following.&#8221; (Would they do that!) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs that order Muslims to follow the revelation sent down from Allah (may He be Exalted) and warn against following one&#8217;s personal desires and all that is dictated by reason deviating from the right path.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Thus, it is not permissible for a person to be fooled by his reason whatever comprehensive understanding and thought he might have; that he takes his reason as a fundamental and the transmitted texts of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah as a branch, accepting what is in agreement with reason and rejecting or distorting all that is in disagreement with it. This implies an accusation of the Divine Shari`ah (Law). Also, it undermines the fundamentals and pillars of the Shari`ah, as there are different reasons, natures, and thoughts, and people hardly agree on anything with the exception of necessities and the things that are perceptible through the senses. If the reality is as mentioned, which of all these reasons can be adopted as a fundamental to which people refer when differing on a case and to understand the transmitted texts of the Shari`ah?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What a wise opinion was said by Shaykh-ul-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be Merciful with him),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;People should know that nothing related to direct reason or the authentic transmitted texts makes it obligatory to oppose the method of the Salaf (righteous predecessors). Those who oppose the Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and the Salaf of this Ummah (nation based on one creed) are in a confused state in which they can not differentiate between right and wrong. Anyone who denies Ru&#8217;yah (seeing Allah), claims that reason regards such an act as impossible. Thus, he needs to have another Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation) for the word &#8220;Ru&#8217;yah&#8221;. Also, those who regard it as impossible for Allah (may He be Exalted) to have Knowledge and Might and to have uncreated speech, say that reason regards such matters as impossible, so they resort to Ta&#8217;wil. Moreover, those who deny the resurrection of bodies and real eating and drinking in Paradise claim that reason regards such matters as impossible, so they resort to Ta&#8217;wil. Also, those who claim that Allah (may He be Exalted) is not seated on the Throne, claim that reason regards it as impossible, thus, they resort to Ta&#8217;wil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The evidence on the corruption of opinions offered by those people is that none of them has a fixed rule regarding what is considered impossible by reason. Some of them claim that reason regards as permissible or obligatory what is regarded as impossible by others. So, which of these can be adopted in terms of considering the Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah? As said by Imam Malik Ibn Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), &#8220;How foolish we are to abandon what is revealed to Muhammad (may peace be upon him) through Jibril (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) when a person excels others in argument comes to us!&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the Ruling on Listing to Unknown Speakers and Taking Knowledge from them?</strong></p>
<p>ما حكم سماع أشرطة المجاهيل وأخذ العلم عنهم؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah al-hamdulillaah wa salaatu wa salaam ‘alaa rasoolillaah wa ‘alaa aalihi wa sahbihi wa man tabi’a hudaahu wa bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trials of today are very many. Innovations and mixing up innovators with the people of the sunnah and their outward call to the sunnah and salafiyyah is wide spread, for this reason one should be cautious. ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Abbaas used to say, if a man said ‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) or the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, we (used to) rush to him and went out to seek him, listening to him, but when the fitnah occurred they began asking about the men (who were narrating the knowledge) like how Ibn Seereen mentioned “we said: name to us your men” meaning they were known by whom they narrated from. So from there they would know if they would listen and accept or refuse and not listen. If that was the case in that time, then our time has more priority. It is a must that one determines and limits those whom he listens to, and from whom he reads from, and who he takes from, and (the works he) issues, and also who he sits with, this is very important. As for being a haatib layl (one who gathers wood at nigh i.e. blindly, heedlessly), listing to everyone and those who are unknown. No, it is feared that a trial will befall this one. Surely from the signs of success from Allaah and wanting good for his slave, it is uprightness and guidance that he helps him to sit, mix with and take from the people of the Sunnah. It is obligatory to have seriousness and diligence towards seeking out that which brings about success and guidance from Allaah, and Allah is the one who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">بسم الله والحمدلله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه ومن تبع هداه وبعد ، الفتن اليوم كثيرة جدا, والبدع كثيرة جدا, وتلبس المبتدعة بأهل السنة وإعلانهم للسنة والسلفية كثير جدا؛ لذلك ينبغي الحذر. وإذا كان عبدالله بن عباس يذكر أنهم كانوا إذا قال رجل : سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم, أو قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم , ابتدرناه ،يبادرونه, يشرئبون إليه, يسمعون منه ، لكن لما وقعت الفتنة صاروا يسألون عن الرجال كما ذكر ابن سيرين: (قلنا : سموا لنا رجالكم). أي يعرفون عمن ينقلون, ومن ثم من خلال النقلة يعرفون هل يسمعون ويقبلون,أم يرفضون ولا يسمعون. فهذا إذا كان في ذلك الزمان, ففي زماننا أولى,لابد أن يحدد الإنسان لمن يسمع, ولمن يقرأ, وعمن يأخذ ويصدر, وعند من يجلس, هذا مهم جدا, أما أن يكون حاطب ليل يسمع للجميع وللمجاهيل ,لا,هذا تخشى عليه الفتنة ، وإن من علامات وصور توفيق الله وإرادته بعبده الخير والصلاح والهداية أن يوفقه إلى مجالسة ومخالطة والأخذ عن أهل السنة ، فالواجب الجد والاجتهاد والتحري استجلابا لتوفيق الله وهدايته ، والله الموفق</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling of an individual who loves a scholar or a Da&#8217;ee and says: I love him very much, I do not want to listen to anyone refuting him and I take his word even if it goes against the evidence, because the shaykh has more knowledge of the evidence than us?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is detestable and blameworthy partisanship and it is not allowed. We love the scholars-and all praise is to Allaah-and we love the Du&#8217;aat (callers) for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. However if one from amongst them makes an error in an issue, we make clear the truth in that issue with the evidence and this does not decrease our love for the one who is refuted nor does it decrease his status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik-rahimahullaah- said: <strong>&#8220;There is no one from amongst us except that he will refute or be refuted, except the companion of this grave.&#8221;</strong> Meaning the Messenger of Allaah SAllaahu Alihee Wasallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we refute some of the people of knowledge and some of the people of virtue, this does not mean that we hate him or dispraise him, we only make clear what is correct and for this reason some of the scholars, when some of their colleagues made an error, said: <strong>&#8220;So and so is beloved to us, however the truth is more beloved to us than him. &#8220;</strong> And this is the correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not understand from this that to refute some of the scholars in an issue where they have erred in, means lowering them or having hatred for them. Rather the scholars have not ceased refuting each other and at the same time being brothers and having mutual love. It is not allowed for us to take everything that an individual says unquestionably, whether he is correct or in error, because this is partisanship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose statement is taken absolutely and nothing from it is left, is the Messenger of Allaah Sallaahu Alihee Wasallam. Because he is a Messenger from his Lord and does not speak from his desires. As for other than them (messengers), then sometimes they make errors and sometimes they are correct, even though they may be from the best of the people, they are Mujtahidoon that make mistakes at times and are correct at others. No one is infallible from falling into error except the Messenger of Allaah Sallaahu Alihee Wasallam. It is therefore Waajib that we know this and that we do not remain silent upon error, due to love of an individual. Rather it is upon us that we make the error clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Sallaahu Alihee Wasallam said: <strong>&#8220;The religion is sincere advice. We said: To whom. He said: To Allaah, His book, His messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their general people.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So clarification of an error is advice for all, as for concealing it, then this goes against advice.</p>
