<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 4 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">iyyāka na’budu wa iyyāka nasta’īn</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You alone&#8221; (iyyāka)</strong>: This is a case in grammar when the direct object comes before the verb, <strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>. In Arabic grammar, when the direct object precedes the verb, it gives a sense of restriction, so the meaning would be, “<strong>We do not worship anyone or anything except you alone</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>: Meaning: We humble ourselves to you in complete humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, you find the believers placing the most honorable part of their bodies (their faces) at the level of their feet in humility to Allah (عزّ وجلّ). They prostrate on the ground, covering their foreheads with dirt. This is from their humbleness before Allah. And if another person were to say, “I will give you the whole world and what it contains, just prostrate to me once,” you will never find true believers accepting this because this type of humility is a form of worship specifically for Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “<strong>worship</strong>” includes doing everything Allah commands and avoiding everything he forbids. Whoever is not in accordance with this, not carrying out what he is commanded to do and avoiding what he is forbidden to do then he is not a true worshipper and servant. A worshipper is someone who obeys the one he worships in whatever he legislates. So, worship requires that mankind carry out everything they are commanded to do and avoid everything they are forbidden from doing. However, it is not possible to fulfill all of these duties without the help and assistance of Allah. Because of this, Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;and from you alone we seek help&#8221; (wa iyyāka nasta’īn)</strong>: Meaning, “We do not seek the help of anyone else in worship or in anything else.” This “seeking of help” is to request the help and assistance, and Allah combines between worship and the seeking of assistance or reliance in many places the noble Qur&#8217;an. This is because worship could not be completely established except with the help of Allah by entrusting one’s affairs to him, and relying on him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 4:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the virtues of this verse is the sincerity in worship that is due to Allah alone as he says, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8220;. It shows that this worship is due only to Allah by the direct object (“<strong>You</strong>”) coming before the verb (“<strong>we worship</strong>”) according to the rules of Arabic grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point is that seeking help is also sincerely and solely for Allah based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Likewise, the direct object precedes the verb indicating a sense of restriction just like in the first part of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those points being said, what if someone asks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">How is it that seeking help is exclusively for Allah alone when there has come in another verse:</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety</span>.[Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, how do we understand the previous statements about seeking help only from Allah when, here in this verse, Allah confirms that seeking help from other than himself is permissible (rather it is a command here)? Also, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> تُعِيْنُ الرَّجُلَ فِي دَابَّتِهِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُ عَلَيْهَا، أَوْ تَرْفَعُ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا مَتَاعَهُ صَدَقَةٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Helping someone onto his riding animal, carrying him on it, or lifting his belongings up to him while he is on it &#8211; all of these are (considered) acts of charity</span>. [Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2891) and Muslim (no. 1009)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this question is that the act of seeking help and assistance is of two types. The first type is to request help while entrusting all affairs to the one you ask from. For example, you rely completely on Allah and you realize that any result you seek will not come from your own power or capability. This type of seeking help is specific for Allah ( تعالى ); he alone deserves this type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type is to request help or cooperation in something you want to accomplish. This type is permissible as long as the one being requested is living and capable of doing what is asked of him. This is not considered a form of worship. This is the type that Allah refers to when saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety.</span> [Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is further asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Is seeking help from the creation permissible at all times and in all situations?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is no. Requesting help from the creation is only allowed when the one being asked is fully capable of what he is being asked for, otherwise seeking his help is not permissible. An example would be asking help from someone dead in his grave; this is prohibited, rather it is major Shirk (the associating of partners with Allah in worship)! This is because the person in his grave does not even have the ability to help himself, so how could he help someone else? Similarly, if someone seeks the help of another person who is not present with him such as a person believing that someone else in the far eastern part of the world could help him with something in his (the one seeking help) land – this is also major Shirk because the person whose help is sought is not capable of helping the seeker while they are in different lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is now asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So, is it permissible to seek help from the creation if these conditions are met?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that it is better not to ask anyone for any help unless it is absolutely necessary or if it is known that the person would be happy to provide help. In this case, one could request his assistance in order to please him. The act that you seek another’s help in fulfilling must also not be something sinful and prohibited.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The First Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this introduction, the first hadeeth concerns the intention. This is the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the leader of the believers and the second khalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ameerul-Mu’mineen, Abi Hafs (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that: “The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(The value of)<strong> an action depends on the intention behind it. A man will be rewarded only for what he intended. The emigration of one who emigrates for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) is for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) ; and the emigration of one who emigrates for gaining a worldly advantage or for marrying a woman is for what he has emigrated.”</strong></span> [Sahih Muslim, Book 020, Number 4692]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the second khalifah, was from the notables of Quraysh. He accepted Islaam in the fifth or sixth year after the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) message, and in his acceptance of Islaam there was a might for the Muslims. He attended all the battlefields and took the line after Abu Bakr’s (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) covenant to him and he established the Khilafah in the best way after Abu Bakr. In the 23rd year (after Hijrah), four nights before the end of the month of Dhul Hijjah, he was stabbed by a magian after he made the <em>takbeer</em> for Salaatul-Fajr. He was carried to his home and he died three nights later. He was buried with the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and Abu Bakr in the apartment of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). And his Khilafah lasted ten years six months and a few days. May Allaah be pleased with him and with all the companions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of the hadeeth is making clear the rank of the intention vis-a-vis the actions. This is a great and comprehensive hadeeth, making clear that the intention is comprehensive, covering all actions such that there is no action without intention. And therefore, the actions correctness or corruption, the reward upon it or the punishment, is dependent upon the intention. And each person shall have but that which he intended, whether it is a noble objective or a lowly, despicable one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), made that clear in order to incite the doer to aim high in his intention seeking Allaah’s Face and the Final Abode and to keep away from the lowly intentions and base ranks. So if the intention is correct, intending the Face of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>), then it is acceptable and if otherwise then it will not be (acceptable) because Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) is Most Sufficient and in no need of partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) gave a similitude in migration so that it may be reference for the rest of actions. So those who migrate have different intentions and thus the reward will vary to a great extent, even though the action is one (and that is the migration). So whoever migrates to Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), seeking the reward of Allaah and the victory for the Deen and giving help to the Deen then he is the sincere <em>Muhaajir</em> (immigrant), who attained in his intention the highest and most noble objectives. And whoever migrates seeking this lowly life and its vanishing enjoyments is the one who went base in his intention and therefore of the Hereafter he shall have no share. The one who migrates from the land of shirk seeking the reward of Allaah and the protection of His Deen and the support of the Deen and seeking to learn the Shari’ah, so his <em>hijrah</em> (migration) is <em>fee sabeelillaah</em> and Allaah will keep him steadfast on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intention distinguishes the worship from the habit. Take for example <em>al-ghusl</em> (taking a bath): If it is done intending to lift the <em>janabah</em> (the sexual defilement) then it is ‘<em>Ibaadah</em> (worship). And if it is done for cleansing or to cool off then it is <em>&#8216;aadah</em> (a habit).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Emphasizing the importance of the <em>Niyyah</em> (intention) concerning the actions. And that the correctness of deeds and the recompense is in accordance with the intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Inciting to have sincerity in the intention and making clear the merit of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Warning from seeking and intending this lowly life in our actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Showing that people differ concerning their intentions and that each will have that which is in accordance with his own intention. (A man will be rewarded only for what he intended.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>At-Taharatu minal `amal</em> (purification is from actions), and therefore it cannot be established without a <em>Niyyah</em> (intention). Everyone who performs the purification, then his purification is in accordance with his intention (and this is the point of evidence in this hadeeth which fell under the chapter of purification).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The excellence in teaching by the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and his perfect eloquence and clarification where he mentions the foundations and the principles foundations then he explains them by examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is evidence for the intentions place is the heart and utterance of it is an innovation. Also, it is a must to be careful concerning <em>ar-Riyaa</em> (showoff and seeking fame for the sake of this life). And that the <em>hijrah</em> (the migration) from the land of shirk to the land of Islam is from the most meritorious of deeds if the Face of Allaah is intended in that. This is in summary the points relevant to this matter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Questions for this Hadeeth</span></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/hijrah"><em>hijrah</em> </a>(migration) in this hadeeth?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">How is the manner of migration to the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), after his death? What does it mean?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Why did the author (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) chose this hadeeth of ‘Umar in this chapter of purification? What is the point of relevance?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">When did ‘Umar accept Islaam?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is the Islaamic meaning of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/tahara-purification/"><em>Taharah</em> </a>(purification)?</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#993300;">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</span> )</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you</strong></span>) (15: 99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said: &#8220;Salim said, (This means) death.&#8221;&#8217; This Salim is Salim bin Abdullah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin Abdullah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, &#8220;Death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-Ala&#8217;- one of the women of the Ansar &#8211; that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon Uthman bin Mazun after he had died, Umm Al-Ala&#8217; said, &#8220;<em>May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Saib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How do you know that Allah has honored him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;<em>May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! If not him, then who else</em>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْر»</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(As far as he is concerned, the death has come to him, and I hope for good for him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence that the meaning of this Ayah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you.) is that acts of worship, such as prayer and the like, are obligatory on man so long as his mind is sound, so he should pray according to his best ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;">صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب</span>»</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret <em>Yaqin</em> (the certainty) as <em>Marifah</em> (&#8220;spiritual knowing&#8221;) as some of the <strong>Sufis</strong> do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of <em>Marifah</em>, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets &#8211; peace be upon them &#8211; and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by <em>Yaqin</em> here is death, as we have stated above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for vows:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُوفُونَ بِالنَّذْرِ وَيَخَافُونَ يَوْمًا كَانَ شَرُّهُ مُسْتَطِيرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>They fulfill their vows and they fear a Day whose evil will be widespread</b></span> [76:7] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>26</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">26</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-Nadhr </em>(making a vow): it is that a person makes something binding upon himself which was not originally binding upon him in the legislation, such as his making a vow that he will perform a fast, or his making a vow that he will give such and such in charity – then it becomes binding upon him to carry out his vow, because of the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من نذر أن يطيع الله فليطعه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Whoever makes a vow that he will obey Allaah, then let him obey Him</span>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (6696 &amp; 6700) from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And making a vow is a type from the types of worship, it is not permissible to do it except for Allaah. So whoever makes a vow for a grave or for an idol or for other than that, then he has committed <em>shirk</em> with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and it will be a vow of sin and shirk. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومن نذر أن يعصي الله فلا يعصه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">And whoever makes a vow that he will commit an act of disobedience to Allaah, then let him not disobey Him</span>”.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for sacrificing is His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: My prayer and my sacrificing and my living and my dying are all for Allaah alone, the Lord of the whole of creation </strong></span>[6:162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the sunnah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ ذَبَحَ لِغَيْرِ الله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has cursed the one who sacrifices for other than Allaah.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>25</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">25</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing or slaughtering) is of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Firstly</span>:</strong> sacrificing which is done to seek closeness and to honour and venerate someone, and this is not permissible except for Allaah the Perfect and Most High, because it is an act of worship involving wealth. So therefore it is not permissible to sacrifice for the <em>jinn</em> nor for the devils nor for the kings nor for the leaders in order to show honour and veneration of them, because this is worship – it is not permissible except for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those people who sacrifice for the jinn in order to gain safety from their evil, or in order for a sick person to be cured, as is done by the soothsayers and by the astrologers, those who claim to be able to heal or cure, and who say to the people, “if you sacrifice such and such in order to cure your sick person and do not mention the Name of Allaah upon it” – this is major shirk which takes a person outside of the religion and this is what Allaah the Most High has said in warning against doing it for other than Allaah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: My prayer and my sacrificing and my living and my dying are all for Allaah alone, the Lord of the whole of creation </strong></span>[6:162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So pray for your Lord and sacrifice to Him</span> </strong>[108:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: make sacrifice for your Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second type of sacrifice is: </strong></span>slaughtering an animal in order to obtain meat to eat. This, there is no harm in it, because it is not something slaughtered to draw closer to anyone or to venerate anyone, it is just being sacrificed for a need, and eating is from that; so this, there is no harm in it, because it is not a type of worship, and it can be slaughtered in order to sell the meat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The third type of sacrifice is: </strong></span>sacrificing which is done at times of joy and happiness, on the occasion of a marriage or on the occasion of settling in a new home or someone returning after an absence, or the like of that, by gathering one’s relatives and then performing a sacrifice in order to show one’s happiness and joy at what has occurred. This, there is no harm in it, because it does not contain veneration of anyone, and it is not seeking to draw closer to anyone, rather it is just a case of joy and happiness at something that has occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Fourthly</span>:</strong> sacrificing in order to give meat away in charity for the poor people and the needy and the destitute, this is counted as being a sunnah, and it enters into worship.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (1978) from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Alee ibn Abee Taalib <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Alee (<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>) said: Allaah’s Messenger (<em>salallaahu `alaihi wassallam</em>) narrated to me four words, saying:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah curses whoever slaughters to other than Allaah. </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah curses whoever curses his parents. </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah curses the one who shelters an innovator or wrongdoer. </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah curses the one who alters the boundaries of a land.”</strong></span></li>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof for <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue and deliverance):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَاسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Remember when you sought the aid and deliverance of your Lord, and He responded to you </b></span>[8:9]<b> </b><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>24</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">24</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Istighaathah </em>is a type of the types of worship, and it is seeking <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Ghauth</em></strong></span> (deliverance or rescue), and it does not occur except at times of adversity or great difficulty, when a person comes to be in a situation of adversity, then he seeks deliverance and rescue from Allaah and he seeks salvation from this adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And <em>al-Istighaathah </em>(seeking rescue and deliverance) is of two types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type is:</strong> <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue) from a created being, with regard to something that no-one is able to do except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and this is <em>shirk</em>. So whoever seeks rescue and deliverance from other than Allaah, whether it be from a <em>jinn</em> or a human or those people who are absent or from the dead, then this is <em>shirk</em> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So seeking rescue and deliverance through the dead and those who are absent from the devils and the <em>jinn</em>, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>shirk</em></strong></span> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is: </strong>seeking aid and rescue from a created being who is present and who is alive with regard to something he is able to do – this is permissible. He the Most High said in the story of Moosaa:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَاسْتَغَاثَهُ الَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى الَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the man who was upon his religion</strong> (i.e. the religion of Moosaa)<strong> he called to him for assistance and rescue against the one who was an enemy </strong></span>[28:15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em></strong><strong> (Seeking Refuge) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn </strong></span>[113:1]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>22</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">22</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em>:</strong></span> means seeking refuge with someone who can defend you against something disagreeable which you fear in order that he should repel from you this thing. This is<em> al-Isti‘aadhah.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> is a type from the types of worship. It is not permissible for you to seek refuge in other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever seeks refuge with a grave or with an idol, or with anything besides Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then he will be a <em>mushrik</em>, who has committed major <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الْإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادُوهُمْ رَهَقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there used to be men from mankind who would seek refuge in men from the <em>jinn</em>, and they only increased them in transgression</span>. </strong>[72:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs in the days of ignorance, when they stopped off at a place on the earth, one of them used to say, “I seek refuge in the chief of this valley”: meaning the chief one from the <em>jinn</em>; he would seek refuge from the evil of the foolish ones of his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said refuting that and making clear what is legislated in place of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever stops off at a place and he says, “<span style="color:#808000;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of whatever He has created</span>”, then nothing will harm him until he travels on from that stopping place of his.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the correct replacement, seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allaah instead of seeking refuge in the <em>jinn</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, &#8220;I seek refuge in the Lord of the Dawn&#8221; </strong></span>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Al-Falaq</em>”, is the dawn, and the Lord of the dawn, He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَالِقُ الْإِصْبَاحِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who causes the dawns to break </strong></span>[6:96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the One Who brings out the light of the day into the darkness of the night. Who is able to do that except Allaah the Perfect and Most High?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak </strong></span>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the Lord of dawn when it breaks, the Sovereign Owner, the One who controls it, the One having full ability over it.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From the evil of that which He created </strong></span>[113:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covers the evil of all of the created beings, he seeks refuge in Allaah from the evil of all of the created beings. This will suffice you for every seeking refuge and every seeking protection which the people do.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of the <em>Ghaasiq </em></strong>(darkening night)<strong> as it comes with its darkness </strong>(or the moon as it sets or goes away)</span> [113:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-Ghaasiq</em></strong></span>”, is the darkness of the night; since in the darkness wild animals and wild beasts come out so then you are in danger, so you seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of this darkness and whatever is beneath it from these harmful things.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of those who blow upon knots </strong></span>[113:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the sorcerers, you seek refuge in Allaah from sorcery / magic and its people, because sorcery / magic is tremendous evil.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of the envier when he envies </strong></span>[113:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>aasid</em>”</strong></span>, the envier, he is the one who hopes and wishes for favours to pass away from other people; when he sees someone having a favour then he becomes furious, and he wishes for this blessing to pass away out of envy and out of transgression and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And it is one of the worst of blameworthy qualities, because it involves raising objections against Allaah, and it involves evil towards the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And entering into it is the person who gives the<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> evil eye</strong></span>, the one who causes harm with his look, because striking with the evil eye is a type of envy, so you should seek refuge in Allaah from these evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this indicates that <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) is worship, it is not permissible to be directed to other than Allaah, so you do not seek refuge in a created being, and whoever seeks refuge in a created being then he has committed shirk with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said to ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And if you seek aid then seek the aid of Allaah”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Mankind</span>. </strong>[114:1]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>23</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>23</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مَلِكِ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of Mankind. The King of mankind. The One Who is rightfully worshipped by mankind. From the evil of the whisperer, who whispers and then withdraws. The one who whispers into the hearts of mankind. From <em>jinn</em> and from men. </strong></span>[114:1-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Mighty and Majestic commands seeking refuge in the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, the One Who is rightfully worshipped by mankind – these are all Names and Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and it contains the three types of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>: <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship), <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Uloohiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship) and <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Asmaa wa<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>ifaat</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Names and Attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seek refuge in Allaah and in these Names and Attributes, seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of <em>al-Waswaas</em> (the whisperer) – and he is Satan. As for <em>Wiswaas</em> (a whispering) then that is a verbal noun from the verb <em>waswasa yuwaswisu</em>. As for <em>al-Waswaas</em> then it is a name from the names of Satan, because he whispers to mankind and gives him false ideas, and he pre-occupies him in order to cast terror into his heart and uncertainty and confusion in his affairs, particularly with regard to the affair of worship, because Satan whispers to man in acts of worship until he confuses him regarding his prayer or his act of worship, and then finally the person comes out from his prayer believing that it was null and void. Or he prays and then he believes that he was not upon <em>wudhoo’</em>, or that he did not stand up for such and such, or that he did not perform such and such, the person comes to suffer from whispers and he is not calm in his worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah the Majestic and Most High has given us the remedy for this dangerous matter, and that is that you seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of this whisperer who is <em>al-Khannaas.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-Khannaas</em></span>:</strong> meaning the one who departs and moves away, so he whispers when you are negligent of the remembrance of Allaah, and he withdraws – meaning he falls back when you remember Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So he whispers when the person is inattentive, and he is one who withdraws and moves away when one remembers Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The one who whispers into the hearts of mankind. From <em>jinn</em> and from mankind </strong></span>[114:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if the meaning – and Allaah knows best – that there are those who whisper from the <em>jinn</em> and from mankind as well – those who whisper things to the people; they come to the people and they cause them to have doubts, so just as there are devils from the <em>jinn</em> who whisper evil, then likewise there are devils from mankind who whisper also, so you should seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of the two tribes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“No-one seeking refuge has sought refuge by means of the like of these two” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: these two soorahs (Soorat-ul-Falaq and Soorat-un-Naas). So it is befitting for the Muslim that he should read these two after the prayers and that he should repeat them again and again, and that he should recite these two when he goes to sleep along with Aayat-ul-Kursee and Soorat-ul-Ikhlaa<u>s</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should recite <em>Aayat-ul-Kursee</em> and <em>Soorat-ul-Ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> and the two <em>soorahs</em> for seeking refuge, he should recite them after every prayer, and repeat them three times after maghrib and after fajr, and likewise recite these two when you go to sleep in order that Satan should move away from him and not disturb his sleep for him and not trouble him with nightmares.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The witness from these two <em>soorahs</em> is that Allaah has commanded seeking refuge in Him alone, so this proves that seeking refuge in other than him, whether it be jinn or mankind or any created thing, that that is not permissible because it is a type from the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2708) from a hadeeth of Khawlah bint Hakeem as-Sulamiyyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Aallaahu ‘anhaa</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aanah</em></strong><strong> (Appealing for Aid and Assistance) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Isti‘aanah</em> (appealing for aid and assistance) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You alone do we worship and to You alone do we appeal for aid </strong></span>[1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you seek aid, then seek the aid of Allaah”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><sup>, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>12</strong></span></sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">12</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Isti‘aanah: </em>means seeking aid and assistance, and it is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type </strong><span style="color:#993300;">(which is worship)</span><strong>:</strong> is seeking assistance upon something which no-one but Allaah is able to do; then directing this to other than Allaah is <em>shirk</em>, whoever seeks aid and assistance of other than Allaah with regard to something which only Allaah can carry out, then he has committed shirk, because he has directed a type from the types of worship to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">(which is not worship)</span><strong>: </strong>seeking aid upon something which someone from the creation is able to carry our, so you may seek someone’s help to build a wall along with you or to carry some luggage along with you or to help you to do something which is permissible which you wish to do, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And help one another upon righteousness and dutifulness towards Allaah, and do not help one another upon sin and transgression </strong></span>[5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>al-Isti‘aanah </em>(seeking aid and assistance) with regard to everyday matters which the people are able to do, there is no harm in this, because it is co-operation upon righteousness and dutifulness to Allaah. And He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Allaah continues to aid the servant for as long as the servant is aiding his brother”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by Muslim (2699) from a hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for seeking aid and assistance from someone from the creation with regard to something which no-one can carry out except Allaah, for example bringing about provision and repelling harm, then this cannot be except for Allaah; such as seeking the aid of the dead and seeking the aid of the <em>jinn</em> and the devils, and seeking the aid of people who are absent and they cannot hear your calling out their names – this is <strong>major</strong> <strong><em>shirk</em></strong>, because you are seeking aid from those who are not able to aid you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You Alone do we worship and Your aid Alone do we seek </strong></span>[1:5]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Iyyaka na‘budu</em></span></strong>”, (You Alone do we worship): this is a case of putting the governed word before the operative word. The governed word, “You”, is in the accusative case and, “We worship” is the governing word which caused, “<em>Iyyaka</em>” to be in the accusative case. And putting the governed word before the operative word indicates restriction. So the meaning of, “<em>Iyyaka Na‘budu</em>”, is – we do not worship anyone else besides You. So worship is restricted (to only be) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Wa Iyaaka nasta‘een</em></strong></span>”, (and Your aid Alone do we seek): this is a restriction of seeking aid (to only be) from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and that is with regard to those affairs which no-one is able to carry out except Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, “<em>Iyaaka nasta‘een</em>”, (Your aid Alone do we seek): it shows freeing onself from, “<strong><em><u>H</u>awl</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Quwwah</em></strong>” – from any claim to having the ability to change things and from having power, and that a person has no power except with Allaah’s aid, and that no-one is able to do anything except with the aid of Allaah the Mighty and Majetic, and this is the utmost worship and servitude to Allaah, when a person frees himself from shirk, and he frees himself from, <em><u>H</u>awl </em>&#8211; from any claim to being able to bring about change, and from having <em>Quwwah </em>&#8211; from himself having power. So this is the utmost worship and servitude to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by At-Tirmidhee as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa (</em>part of <u>h</u>adeeth 19 in An-Nawawee’s 40 <u>h</u>adeeth)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Inaabah</em></strong><strong> (Turning Repentantly and Obediently) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>al-Inaabah </em>(turning repentantly and obediently) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So turn in repentance and obedience to your Lord and submit to Him </strong></span>[39:54]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>20</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>20</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Inaabah: </em>it means returning and it has the meaning of <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting), and repenting and <em>al-Inaabah </em>have one and the same meaning. However some of the scholars have said <em>al-Inaabah </em>is more specific than <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting), meaning it is more emphasized because it, <em>Inaabah</em> is <em>Tawbah</em> (repenting) but along with turning to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, meaning it is a specific repentance, and a person may repent and leave the sin and not return to it, and he may regret it, however his turning to Allaah may be a weak turning. Whereas <em>al-Inaabah </em>then indeed it means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>turning towards to Allaah</strong></span> the Mighty and Majestic. And therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So turn in repentance and obedience to your Lord and submit to Him …</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning turn back to Him and turn fully to Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped</strong> </span>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the punishment which destroys and annihilates comes, then repentance will not be accepted from those who repent at that time.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّا آمَنُوا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الْخِزْيِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for the people of Yunus when they believed, then we took away from them the humiliating punishment </strong></span>[10:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was an exception, otherwise when the punishment which destroys descends, then repentance is not accepted, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.. before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped</span> </strong>[39:54]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently), they have an appointed time and they have a limit, so repentance will not be accepted from the person who is experiencing the death rattle, or someone to whom death comes, and the repentance will not be accepted from one whom the punishment which destroys and annihilates descends upon. And repentance will not be accepted when the sun comes out from its place of setting before the establishment of the Hour. Repentance will not be accepted then. So therefore Allaah encourages the servant upon <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently) before the time limit comes to its end.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped </strong></span>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the witness is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Turn to your Lord repentantly and obediently</span> </strong>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently) is a type from the types of worship because He said, “to your Lord”. So this shows that it is a type from the types of worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Khashyah</em></strong><strong> (Fear and Awe) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p>The proof for <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ </span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of them </strong></span>[2:150] <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>19</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">19</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khashyah</em> (awe) is a type of <em>Khawf</em> (fear), and it is more specific than just fear. And it is said <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) is fear which is mixed with <strong>veneration</strong>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of them </strong></span>[2:150]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Perfect and Most High commanded having <em>Khashyah</em> (awe) of Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said in the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِي وَلِأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of them, but rather have <em>Khashyah</em> </strong>(awe)<strong> of Me, and so that I may complete My favour upon you and so that you may be guided. </strong></span>[2:150]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He commanded having <em>Khashyah</em> (awe) of Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and He said in description of those who pray <em><u>s</u>alaah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ هُم مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَبِّهِم مُّشْفِقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who have fear of the punishment of their Lord </strong></span>[70:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they have fear, they are the elite ones from the creation, they have fear of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And He said about the Angels:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They have fear of their Lord from above them, and they do whatever they are commanded</span> </strong>[16:50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The elite of the creation from the Angels and the Messengers and the beloved and the obedient servants and the righteous ones, they have the utmost <em>Khashyah</em> (awe) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and <em>Khawf</em> (fear) of Him, He the Perfect and Most High and <em>Rahbah</em> (dread) of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe), all of them have a single meaning, even though some of them are more specific than others. However they all share in being <em>Khawf</em> (fear) of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And these are from the characteristics of the Prophets and the righteous servants of Allaah, and they are tremendous types of worship and they are from the actions of the hearts which are not known except to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Ar-Raghbah</em></strong><strong> (fervent desire) and <em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility), and the Proof for Each</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility), is His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا ۖ وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They used to hasten to perform acts of devotion to Allaah, and they used to worship Us <em>raghaban</em> (upon love and desire), and <em>rahaban</em> (upon fear), and they were were reverent and humble before Allaah </span></strong>[21:90]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>18</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>18</strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire): it means seeking something which is praiseworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread): is fear of something which is dreaded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَإِيَّايَ فَارْهَبُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have dread of Me </strong></span>[2:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is a type of <em>Khawf</em> (fear);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) have one and the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility): it is a type of humbling oneself to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And humbly submitting and humbling onself before Him, He the Perfect and Most High – it is from the greatest of levels of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<em>Innahum</em>”, (they): this pronoun refers back to the Prophets, since in <em>Soorat-ul-Anbiyaa</em> Allaah has mentioned the stories of the Prophets, and then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا ۖ وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They used to hasten to perform acts of devotion to Allaah, and they used to worship Us <em>raghaban</em> (upon love and desire), and <em>rahaban</em> (upon fear), and they were were reverent and humble before Allaah</strong></span> [21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They used to hasten upon doing acts of good </strong></span>[21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they would race to them, and they would hasten to them. This is the characteristic of the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>aalatu wassalaam, </em>they would not be lazy and they would not behave as if they were powerless, rather they hastened to doing good deeds, and they raced towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they invoked and worshipped us with <em>Raghbah</em> </strong></span>[21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: desiring what lies with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, desiring attainment of what they wished for.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَرَهَبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High, <strong>“<em>wa rahaban</em>”, (with dread)</strong>: meaning with fear of Us, so they called upon Allaah to have mercy upon them, and they called upon Him not to punish them, and not to bring them to account and not to seize them with punishment. So they had hope for the mercy of Allaah, and they feared His punishment, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ الْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُ ۚ إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ كَانَ مَحْذُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those whom they call upon, themselves seek a means of nearness to draw themselves closer to their Lord, to see which of them can draw closest to Him. They hope for His mercy and they fear His punishment</strong></span> [17:57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they call upon Allaah having fear of Him, and they worship and call upon Him desiring what lies with Him (from reward), they call upon Allaah so that He should ordain good for them and repel evil from them.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَانُوا لَنَا خَاشِعِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they were reverent and humble towards Us</strong></span> [21:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they were reverential, humbly submitting, humble before Allaah, the Mighty ad Majestic. So they gathered between three characteristics: <em>Ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>Ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility). These are the characteristics of the Prophets <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihim was allam</em> and these three types are from the types of worship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it contains a refutation of <em>Soofees</em>, those who say, “We do not worship Allaah out of desire for His reward, nor out of fear of His punishment, we only worship Him out of love of Him alone”. This is false and futile speech, because the Prophets called upon and worshipped Allaah, <em>raghaban wa rahaban</em> (with fear and with hope) and they were the most complete of the creation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>at-Tawakkul </em></strong><strong>(Trust and Reliance) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And place your reliance and trust in Allaah if you are true believers </strong></span>[5:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever places his trust and reliance in Allaah, then He will suffice him </strong></span>[65:3]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>17</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">17</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>at-Tawakkul</em> is to entrust your affairs and to place reliance in Allaah the Perfect and Most High, and to entrust affairs to Him, He the Perfect and Most High – this is <em>at-Tawakkul </em>(trust and reliance). And it is from the greatest of the types of worship, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And place your reliance and trust in Allaah if you are true believers </strong></span>[5:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The preposition and the word with it are put before the governing word, to indicate restriction.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And upon Allaah place your reliance and trust …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning upon Him and not upon anyone else besides Him, then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… if you are people of <em>eemaan</em> </strong></span>[5:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made it a condition of <em>eemaan</em> to have trust and reliance upon Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And this shows that whoever does not place his trust and reliance upon Allaah, then he is not a believer. So therefore <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) is a tremendous act of worship. So therefore the believer always places his trust and reliance upon Allaah and depends upon Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, from His Names is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Wakeel</em> </strong></span>(the Trustworthy Disposer of Affairs) meaning: the One to Whom the affairs of His servants are entrusted, He the Perfect and Most High. So <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (placing trust and reliance) cannot be except upon Allaah, and it is not permissible to say, “I place my reliance in so-and-so”, because <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) is worship, and worship cannot be except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for when you delegate someone from the creation to carry something out for you, then this is not called <em>tawakkul</em> (trusting in them), it is called <strong><em>tawkeel</em> </strong>(entrusting), and <strong><em>al-wikaalah</em></strong> (authorising or entrusting), this is something well-known, that you entrust and authorise someone to carry out some need for you. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu </em><em>‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, he delegated some people to deputise for him in carrying out certain duties. So <em>at-tawkeel</em> (entrusting or delegating) is something other than <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (having trust and reliance). So <em>at-Tawakkul</em> is worship, and it cannot be except for Allaah, and it is not permissible for you to say, “I placed my trust and reliance in so-and-so”. Rather you should say, “I have entrusted someone with something”. And along with this, you entrust and authorize someone, but you do not place your trust and reliance in him, rather you place your trust and reliance in Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So notice the difference between the two matters and <em>at-Tawakkul </em>and <em>at-tawkeel</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the characteristics of the believers is that which Allaah the Most High mentioned with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b style="color:#008000;">That the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>believers</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> are only those who when Allaah is mentioned, their hearts tremble and when His Signs are recited to them it increases them in </b><em style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">eemaan</em><b style="color:#008000;">, and they place their trust and reliance upon their Lord. </b></span>[8:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from the attributes of the believers, so therefore trust and reliance is a tremendous act of worship, it cannot be except for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because He is <strong><em>al-Qaadir</em></strong> (the One Fully Able to do everything), and He is <strong><em>al-Maalik </em></strong>(the Owner) of everything, and He is fully able to bring about for you whatever you desire. As for the created being, then he might not be able to bring about something for you that you desire, so you may entrust him with carrying something out. However trust and reliance is to be upon Allaah with regard to attainment of that thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you should know that <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) does not negate and contradict <strong>using the means to an end</strong>. So the Muslim gathers between having reliance and trust in Allaah and utilizing the means, and there is no contradiction between them. So you carry out the means which you have been commanded to do. However you do not place your trust and reliance upon the means, rather you place your trust and reliance upon Allaah. You, you plant the seeds for crops in the earth – this is a means. However, you do nor place reliance upon the planting and your own action, rather you have reliance upon Allaah with regard to the growth of this plant, and with regard to its producing fruit and with regard to its being kept safe, and with regard to its being good and suitable, and therefore He says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَأَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَّارِعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you see the seed which you sow? Do you make it grow or are We the One Who causes it to grow? </strong></span>[56:63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the One Who causes it to grow in reality, He is Allaah, but as for you, then you have just carried out the means only. It may produce this plant and grow or it may not produce it. And if it grows, it may be good and fitting, and it may not be good. It may be struck by some calamity, and will pass away.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Ar-Rajaa’</em></strong><strong> (hope and longing) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions and not associate anyone in worship with his Lord </strong></span>[18:110]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>16</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>16</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<strong><em>man kaana yarjoo</em></strong>”: meaning he has hope for the reward of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and in seeing Him openly on the Day of Resurrection, whoever has hope in seeing Allaah openly with his eyes on the day of resurrection, then let him perform righteous deeds, he should carry out the means which will enable him to attain this goal, which is the reward of entry into Paradise and of being saved from the Fire and of looking upon the Face of Allaah – this necessarily follows on, because whoever enters Paradise, then he will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions</span> </strong>[18:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that hope alone is not sufficient, rather there must be action, as for your just having hope in Allaah, but you do not act, then this is to abandon the use of the means. So praiseworthy hope is that which occurs along with righteous action. As for hoping which is not praiseworthy, then it hope which does not have righteous action along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And righteous action is that which fulfills <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>two conditions</strong></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong>: is that it is done purely and sincerely for Him, the Mighty and Majestic.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is that it is done following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So an action will not be righteous unless it fulfills these two conditions: that it is done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah, it does not contain any <em>shirk</em>, and that it should be a correct action, done upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, not containing innovation. So if the two conditions are met then it will be a righteous action, and if any condition is missing, then it will be a corrupt action, it will not benefit the person who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So action which contains shirk will be rejected for the person, and likewise action which contains innovation, it will be rejected for the person. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our affair, then it will be rejected</span>” </strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah contains <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing), and that it is an act of worship to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And it shows that hope will not be correct except along with righteous action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in disconnected form straight after <u>h</u>adeeth 7350, and reported by Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa. </em>And also reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in connected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 2697 and Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa, </em>that she said, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said, “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected”.</p>

<p><strong><em>Al-Khawf</em></strong><strong> (fear), its Types and its Proof</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Khawf</em> (fear) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا ذَٰلِكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is just Satan, he incites you to fear his allies. So do not fear them, but rather fear Me if you are truly believers </strong></span>[3:175]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>15</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>15</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf</em> (fear) is a type from the types of worship, and it is an act of worship of the heart, just the same as is the case with <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) and <em>ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) and <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) – all of these are acts of worship of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf</em> (fear) is apprehension of something unpleasant, and it is of two types:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf-ul-‘Ibaadah</em> (fear which is worship)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Khawf-u<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abee‘ee</em> (natural fear).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>Khawf-ul-‘Ibaadah</em> (fear which is worship)</span></strong>, directing this to other than Allaah is <em>shirk</em>, and that is that a person fears someone other than Allaah with regard to something which no-one besides Allaah is able to do, such as his fearing someone being able to cause him to become ill, or being able to take his soul, or to cause his child to die, as is done by many of the ignorant people. They fear regarding their wives’ pregnancies and for their children, from the <em>jinn</em>, they fear sorcerers, they fear the dead, and so therefore they do actions involving <em>shirk</em> to free themselves from this fear. So this is something which no-one is able to do but Allaah, illnesses and death and bringing provision and cutting off life-span, these matters, no-one is able to do them except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and likewise sending down blessings or other than that. These matters cannot come about except from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, so if he fears anyone with regards to anything which only Allaah can carry out, then this is major <em>shirk</em>, because it is diverting a type of worship to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Like those who fear the graves and of the tombs and of the <em>jinn</em> and of the devils that they can strike them with evil or cause some harm to descend upon them, and so therefore they go and perform actions of nearness to these things to repel their harm, or out of fear of them – this is major <em>shirk</em>. He says, “I fear, if I don’t make a sacrifice for him, that he will afflict me with something, or afflict my children or my wealth, or the like of that, just as was said by the people of Hood:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِن نَّقُولُ إِلَّا اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ آلِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All that we say is that some of our gods have struck you with evil </strong></span>[11:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They threatened him with their gods and they tried to make him fear their objects of worship.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ إِنِّي أُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ وَاشْهَدُوا أَنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن دُونِهِ ۖ فَكِيدُونِي جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنِّي تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّي وَرَبِّكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said, “I call Allaah to witness, and you should bear witness, that I am free of whatever you associate in worship along with Him. So plot all of you against me and don’t give me any respite. I have placed my reliance upon Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.” </strong></span>[11:54-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, he challenges them, all of them, them and their idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So then all of you plot against me, and then don’t give me any respite </strong></span>[11:55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Don’t give me some time, rather plot against me from this moment, and they were not able to do anything against him, rather Allaah aided him against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who fears other than Allaah with regard to things that only Allaah can do, then he has committed major <em>shirk</em>, and this is called the fear which is worship, and the fear which is <em>shirk</em>. Many people have fear of the graves, or of the <em>awliyaa’ </em>(the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah), they fear Satan, they fear the <em>jinn</em>, and therefore they do acts of devotion, putting forward offerings to them, putting forward sacrifices for them, and making vows and giving foods, and other than that, such as throwing money upon their tombs in order to be saved from their evil, or to attain something of their good. Then this is <em>khawf-ul-‘ibaadah</em> (fear which is worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type</strong>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Khawf-u<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abee‘ee</em> (natural fear)</strong></span>: and it is that you fear something which is clear and apparent which is able to do that which you fear from it, such as your fearing a snake or a scorpion or an enemy, these are matters which are clear and visible and are well-known matters, so fearing them is not called <em>shirk</em>, this is natural fear of something which is apparent and known, because you are fearing a means which is clear and apparent, and something which it is desirable for you to protect yourself from and take precaution against, so therefore you take up weapons, you take up a stick to kill a snake or a scorpion, and to kill a wild animal, because these are matters which are felt by the senses, and they contain well-known harm. So if you fear them, then this is not called <em>shirk</em>, rather it is called natural fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore Allaah said with regard to <strong>Moosaa</strong> <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So he departed from it in a state of fear </strong></span>[28:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning from the city</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Fearful, looking about </strong></span>[28:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having fear of his enemies, because he had killed one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> fled to Madyan, and he was on the lookout, and he was fearing that they would catch him, so this is natural fear. However, a person needs to learn to seek shelter and protection in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and to take hold of the means through which he can repel harm, and he relies upon Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and has reliance upon Allaah. He the most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not fear them </strong>(the allies of Satan)<strong> but rather fear Me if you are truly believers </strong></span>[3:175]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is in the soorah Aal-i-‘Imraan in the story of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> along with the people of <em>shirk</em> on the day of U<u>h</u>ud, when the people of shirk threatened them and said, “We will return to them and wipe then out.” So therefore Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا ذَٰلِكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is just Satan, he incites you to fear his allies. So do not fear them, but rather fear Me if you are truly believers</strong></span> [3:175]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This warning and this threat was just from Satan, meaning he tries to cause you to fear his allies, or to cause whoever will submit to him to fear, from the people and to fear him. Then he will gain ascendancy over them.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em> and the Proof for Each</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأنواعُ العبادةِ التي أَمَرَ اللهُ بها: مثلُ الإسلامِ، والإيمانِ، والإحسان</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And all the types of worship which Allaah has commanded such as <em>Al-Islaam</em>, and <em>Al-Eemaan</em> and </span></strong><em><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-I<u>h</u>saan</span></strong> </em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">11</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Shaikh, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he quoted some examples for worship, as a case of quoting examples, not as a case of restriction because they are more than what he mentioned. And it would not be possible to mention them all in a brief treatise. However he mentioned some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaikh-ul-Islaam (Ibn Taymiyyah) has a separate treatise which is called <strong><em>Al-‘Uboodiyyah</em> (worship and servitude)</strong>, which researches the matter of worship and the types of worship and an explanation of the deviations which occurred from the <em>Soofees</em> and others with regards to worship, and it is a valuable treatise which the student of knowledge needs to read.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong>such as <em>Islaam</em>, and <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong>”: these three types are the greatest of the types of worship, and an explanation of them will follow in the speech of the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> with regard to the second fundamental principle. And he mentioned them here because they are from the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Islaam</em> with its five pillars, the two testifications of faith, and establishment of the prayer and giving the <em>zakaat</em> and fasting <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan</em> and making <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to the sacred House of Allaah – these are all acts of worship which are <em>maaliyyah</em> (relating to wealth) and <em>badaniyyah</em> (relating to the body).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise <em>Eemaan</em> with its six pillars, it is from the actions of the heart, <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and eemaan in <em>Al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree), the good of it and the bad of it, this is worship of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise <em>al-I<u>h</u>saan</em> which is a single pillar, and it is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him, and even though you do not see him, then He certainly sees you. This is the highest of the types of worship, because <em>al-I<u>h</u>saan </em>is the highest of all the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these are called the levels of the religion, since together they are the religion, because Jibreel when he asked the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> in the presence of his Companions, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> responded to the question about <em>Islaam</em> and <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em>, he then said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هذا جبريل أتاكم يعلمكم أمر دينكم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This was Jibreel, he came to you to teach you the affair of your religion”</strong></span></p>
<p>[<span style="color:#999999;">Reported by al-Bukhaaree (4777) and reported by Muslim (8, 9 and 10) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So he called these three the religion.</p>

<p><strong>Ad-Du ‘aa (Supplication) its Categories and its Proof.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومنهُ الدعاءُ، والخوفُ، والرجاءُ، والتوكلُ، والرغبةُ، والرهبةُ، والخشوعُ، والخَشيةُ، والإنابةُ، والاستعانةُ، والاستعاذةُ، والاستغاثةُ، والذَّبْحُ، والنذرُ، وغيرُ ذلك من أنواع العبادةِ التي أَمرَ اللهُ بها كلُّها لله تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And from it is <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication)</strong> and <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) and <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) and <em>ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly) and <em>al-Isti‘aanah</em> (appealing for aid and assistance) and <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) and <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking deliverence and rescue) and <em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing) and <em>an-Nadhr</em> (making vows), and other than that from the types of worship which Allaah has commanded, all of them are to be done exclusively for Allaah the Most High</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">12</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and from it is <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication)</strong>”: meaning and from the types of worship is <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication); he began with it because it is the greatest of the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>ad-Du‘aa</em> (supplication) is of two categories: <em>Du‘aa</em> of worship and <em>Du‘aa</em> of making request:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Du‘aa-ul-‘Ibaadah</em></strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(<em>Du‘aa</em> of worship)</span>:</strong> is to praise and extol Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, just as occurs at the beginning of Al-Faati<u>h</u>ah:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All Praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy, the Sovereign Owner of the Day of Recompensing, You Alone do we worship, and Your Aid alone do we seek </strong></span>[1:2-5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of that is <em>Du‘aa</em> of worship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Guide us upon the straight path </strong></span>[1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the <em>soorah, </em>this is <em>Du‘aa</em> of request.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Du‘aa-ul-Mas’alah </em></strong></span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(<em>Du‘aa</em> of making request)</span>: </strong>it is to request something from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, such as requesting guidance and requesting provision and requesting knowledge from Allaah, and requesting for <em>at-Tawfeeq</em> (the granting of success in attaining what is correct).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or call upon anyone along with Allaah </strong></span>[72:18] <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>13</sup> </span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">13</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Al-Masaajid</em></strong>”: this word is used to mean the places where prostration is made, and those places where the prayer is performed, and they are the most beloved place to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and there occurs an encouragement with regard to building them and preparing them, so he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من بنى مسجدا لله كمفحص قطاة أو أصغر بنى الله له بيتا في الجنة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever builds a mosque for Allaah like the nesting-place of a sand grouse or even smaller, then Allaah will build for him a house in Paradise”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That the mosques of Allaah are to be maintained only by those people who truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day </strong></span>[9:18]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maintaining means physical maintenance and spiritual maintenance, maintaining them by clay, and whatever it needs so that it can shelter those who pray, and can shade them from the heat, and can shelter them from the cold and maintaining them through worship, by the prayer and the recitation of the Qur’aan and the remembrance of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>masaajid</em> is also used to mean the seven parts of the body which prostrate, and they are: the forehead and the nose, and the two hands and the two knees and the tips of the two feet, because they perform prostration to Allaah. And the <em>aayah</em> covers both meanings. “And the <em>Masaajid</em>”: meaning the places where prayer is performed, and the parts of the body which perform prostration for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not invoke or call upon anyone along with Allaah </strong></span>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not make these places of prayer, and these places, a place for <em>shirk</em> and for calling upon other than Allaah. Rather it is obligatory that the mosques be purified from any <em>shirk</em>, so there can be no graves in them, and there can be no calling upon other than Allaah in them, and there can be no innovations in them and no newly introduced affairs and no innovated <em>soofee</em> circles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that the mosques are purified from innovations and from <em>shirk</em> and from sins because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic alone, so there cannot be in them except that which is pleasing to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, so do not call upon anyone besides Allaah in these mosques, or utilise the parts of your body in prostrating to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – because this is major <em>shirk</em> just like the person who prostrates to an idol or to a grave or who prostrates to some false object of worship – this is prostrating to something other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the witness is in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So do not invoke or call upon anyone along with Allaah </strong></span>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a command so make supplication purely for Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, “<strong><em>a<u>h</u>adan</em> (anyone)</strong>”: this is general and it covers everything which is called upon besides Allaah, whether it be an Angel or a Prophet or a <em>walee</em> (beloved righteous servant) or a tree or a rock – it covers everything which is called upon besides Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – then this will be major <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever directs anything from them to other than Allaah, then he is a <em>mushrik</em> (person of <em>shirk</em>), a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ لَا بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever worships any other object of worship along with Allaah, which he has no proof for, then his reckoning will be with his Lord, indeed the disbelievers will not prosper </strong></span>[23:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <u>h</u>adeeth there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Supplication is the core of worship”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Those who are too haughty and proud to worship Me will enter Hell-fire in disgrace.”</span> </strong>[40:60]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>14</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">14</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord has said …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, your Lord has commanded you and said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Invoke and call upon Me, and I will respond to you</strong></span> [40:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has commanded making <em>du‘aa</em> (supplication) to Him, He the Perfect, and He has promised to respond, and this is from His generosity, He the Perfect and Most High, because of He has no need at all of our supplication, rather we need to make supplication to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So He is commanding us with something which we need and which will be to our welfare. And He the Perfect becomes angry if you abandon making request of Him, whereas with regards to the creation, the creation becomes angry if you make request of him – therefore the poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Allaah becomes angry if you abandon asking Him<br />
But the children of Aadam, when you ask, he becomes angry.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align:justify;">And another one said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>So if you were to ask the people only for some soil, they would almost<br />
When it was said, “Give it”, become irritated and withhold it</em></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align:justify;">So the people are of three categories:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong>: are those who do not make <em>du‘aa</em> to Allaah at all, so he is too proud and haughty to worship Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is the one who makes <em>du‘aa</em> to Allaah, however, he makes supplication to other than Him also, so he is a <em>mushrik</em> (a person of <em>shirk</em>).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third</strong>: is one who makes <em>du‘aa</em> to Allaah, making <em>du‘aa</em> purely and sincerely for Him, so he is a <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (a person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the hadeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء مخ العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is the core of worship”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء هو العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is worship”</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows the tremendousness of <em>du‘aa</em> and that it is the greatest of the types of worship because the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; مخ العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“… it is the core of worship”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء هو العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is worship”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second narration is more authentic than the narration: الدعاء مخ العبادة  “<em>Du‘aa</em> is the core of worship”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning is one and the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <u>h</u>adeeth with its two narrations clearly shows how tremendous <em>du‘aa</em> is, and that it is the greatest of the types of worship. Just as he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحج عرفة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is ‘Arafah”</strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that the standing in ‘Arafah in <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is the greatest pillar from the pillars of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. It doesn’t mean that the whole of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is just ‘Arafah, but rather that the standing in ‘Arafah is the greatest of the pillars of the Hajj and likewise, worship is not restricted to just being <em>du‘aa</em>, but rather supplication is the greatest of its types. Therefore he said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الدعاء هو العبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>Du‘aa</em> is worship”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To show the greatness of supplication, and to clearly show its status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned the proofs for the different types of worship which he mentioned, and they are <em>al-Khawf</em> (fear) and <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) and <em>at-Tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) and <em>ar-Raghbah</em> (fervent desire) and <em>ar-Rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>al-Khushoo‘</em> (reverence and humility) and <em>al-Khashyah</em> (awe) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly) and <em>al-Isti‘aanah</em> (appealing for aid and assistance) and <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) and <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking deliverence and rescue) and <em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing) and <em>an-Nadhr</em> (making vows), and other than that from the types of worship which Allaah has commanded, all of them are to be done exclusively for Allaah.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by A<u>h</u>mad from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa </em>and reported by Ibn Maajah and Ibn Khuzaimah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillaah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>, and was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> </em>by Shaikh Al-Albaanee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by at-Tirmidhee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>. Shaykh Al-Albaanee mentioned in his checking of Al-Mishkaat that the <u>h</u>adeeth with this wording, its chain of narration is weak, because it contains Ibn Lahee’ah who had a poor memory. What is correct is the <u>h</u>adeeth of An-Nu’maan ibn Basheer <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa </em>who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said, “<strong>Supplication, it is worship</strong>”, and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu‘ alaihi wa sallam</em> recited the <em>aayah</em>, <strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you</span>” </strong>[40:60]”, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and the four Sunan, declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported in the four Sunan (Aboo Daawood, At-Tirmidhee, An-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘AbdurRahmaan ibn Ya‘mar ad-Daylee <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em> declared authentic by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proof for His Lordship and His Divinity and Right to All Worship, He the Perfect and Most High</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37] <sup>7</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and <em>Ilaahiyyah</em> (Divinity and Right to Worship), He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun and the moon: the sun is the tremedous star which gives light to the creation, as a lamp burning and shining, just as Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have made it</strong></span> <span style="color:#008000;">(the sun)<strong> a lamp, burning and shining.</strong></span> [78:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the moon is a light which brightens the night-time and gives light to the pathway of the people. And from their benefits also is the well-being of the creation through its trees and its fruits and oceans. So if the sun were hidden away from the creation, then the creation would suffer harm, and many of the means of livelihood and their welfare would be corrupted and if the moon were hidden away, then likewise. The moon also brings about benefit for their fruits and their trees, along with what it contains also from awareness of reckoning (of time periods). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We made the moon a light and appointed set phases for it so that you should know the number of years and the reckoning of the months days and hours. </strong></span>[10:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons, then say: They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj </strong></span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the crescent moons bring benefit for awareness of time-periods and deadlines, deadlines for debts and deadlines for the waiting periods of the women, and the set times for acts of worship and fasting and Hajj, all of them are known by reckoning based upon these two lights, the sun and the moon. So the solar reckoning and the lunar reckoning contain many benefits for all of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from those things which He has created are the seven heavens. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنَ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who created seven heavens, and their like from the earth. </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah the One Who created seven heavens in levels </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(one above the other)</span> [67:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each being above the other, the lowest heaven, then the one which follows it up until the seventh one. And above them all is the Throne of the Most Merciful, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the earths are seven just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their like from the earth </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are seven levels or layers also, and every level from the levels of the seven heavens and the earths have inhabitants and occupants. And whatever planets and stars are in the heavens the sun and the moon and whatever is in the earth from created things from animals with their different types and from mountains and trees and rocks and minerals and oceans. These are from the signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the creational signs, which are seen and witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His signs is the night: meaning from His signs which prove Lordship and His Ability and His sole right to worship to the exclusion of all else besides Him, is the night which brings darkness, and the daytime which brings light to the whole of the creation. This is from the amazing signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who can make the whole of the creation dark, all at once, and then make the whole of the creation bright, all at once? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. If all of the creation were to gather together to make one part of the earth bright, they would not be able except to make a restricted area bright, if they brought all the electrical generators which are in the world, all of them, they could not make bright except a restricted portion of the earth. As for the sun and the moon then they bring light to the whole of the earth, the night and the day follow each other in succession, and the sun and the moon likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship. </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a nullification of <em>shirk</em>: Do not prostrate to created things. Since from the greatest of the created things are the sun and the moon, and because the people of shirk, they used to worship the sun and prostrate to it, and from them were those who used to worship the moon and the stars, such as the people of Ibraaheem, they would build for them temples in the form of the stars and they would worship them. So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not prostrate to the sun</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>As-Sujood</em> means placing the forehead upon the ground in humble submission to the one who is worshipped, and it is the greatest of the types of worship, and Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أقرب ما يكون العبد من ربه وهو ساجد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The closest that the servant comes to his Lord is whilst he is in prostration” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Reported by Muslim (482) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>. [And the narration of Muslim has a completion at the end, “So therefore make plentiful supplication.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the greatest of the types of worship is prostration upon the ground, since your face is the thing which you cherish the most, you have placed it for Allaah upon the ground, as an act of worship for Allaah and in submission before Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is true prostration, and it is not befitting to perform it as worship except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for prostrating to the sun and the moon, then it is prostration to a created thing, which does not have the right to be prostrated to. So it is not permissible to prostrate to created things, but rather prostration is only for the Creator of the created things. As for the created things, then they are just like you, something created, something managed and controlled. Would you prostrate to a created being who is incapable, just the same as you? This is not permissible. Where have the intellects gone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prostration is only deserved by the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, who is not rendered incapable by anything. So prostration is the right of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, it is not the right of the creation, no matter how great and large the created being is, it is still a created being who is weak and managed and controlled.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship.</strong></span> [41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we do not worship except Allaah. So if you make prostration to Him and you also prostrate to other than Him, then you are not worshippers of Allaah with correct worship. Rather you are worshipping Him along with <em>shirk</em>, and <em>shirk</em> corrupts and destroys worship.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وكلُّ ما سِوَى اللهِ عالََمٌ وأنا واحدٌ من ذلكَ العالَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings.</strong></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullah</em>, explained the manner in which this <em>aayah</em> is used as an evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings</strong>.”: so therefore Allaah is my Lord, because Allaah is the Lord of all of the created beings and I am one of the created beings. So no-one is able to say, “I have a lord besides the Lord of the creation”, neither an unbeliever nor a Muslim. This will not be possible ever and no person with intellect will say it. This is a proof for the <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and since He is the Lord of the whole of the creation, then therefore He is the One deserving worship, and this nullifies the worship of others besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore after it He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You alone do we worship and Your aid alone do we seek. </strong></span>[1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates restriction, because the fact that the governed word is brought forward, “<em>Iyyaaka</em>”, and the governing verb <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>نَعْبُدُ</strong> </span>is put back, indicates restriction. So, “You, we worship”, is different to, “we worship you”, because saying, “we worship”, this is merely affirmation. However, “You, we worship”, this includes negation and affirmation, meaning, “we do not worship anyone else besides you”. And worship will not be correct except with negation and affirmation, and it is the meaning of <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, for it contains negation and affirmation, a negation for the right to be worshipped from everything else besides Allaah, and affirmation of it for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p>Previous Class: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/23/three-fundamental-principles-which-must-be-known/">These Three Fundamental Principles have Tremendous Importance</a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذا قيلَ لكَ: مَنْ رَبُّكَ؟ فقلْ ربي اللهُ الذي ربّاني ورَبَّى جميعَ العالمينَ بنعمِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>So if it is said to you, “Who is your Lord?”, then say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and all of the creation with His favours.”</b></span></span><b> </b><strong><sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> having explained the three fundamental principles in general terms, wanted to explain them in detail one by one, with their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, and from Allaah’s signs within the creation, and from the intellectual evidences. And it is likewise obligatory to base creed and belief upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah, and upon examination of the signs which Allaah has placed within the creation so that it should be firmly grounded and firmly established in the heart and so that all doubts are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for creed and beliefs based upon <em>shubuhaat</em> (incorrect suspicions) and upon doubts and upon sayings of the people and upon blind-following, then these will be beliefs which are short-lived and will not remain firmly established, and they will be open to being disproven and they will be open to being totally refuted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So creed and belief and the rest of the rulings of the legislation are not established except with proofs of the Book and the Sunnah and with accepted intellectual proofs. And therefore the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> he quoted many proofs for these three fundamental principles, so no principle from them occurs except that he has support it with evidences and proofs about which there is certainty which repel doubts and false desires and which firmly implant the creed and belief in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong>So if it is said to you</strong>”: meaning if you are asked about your Lord, and this is a question which will occur, you will be indeed asked about it in this world and in the hereafter, so it is essential that you have knowledge of your Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and that you respond with the correct response based upon <strong>certainty</strong> and <strong>clear proof</strong>. So then say, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, this is the answer, “<strong>the One Who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation with His favours</strong>.” This is using an intellectual proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>, the Lord the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who nurtures all of His servants with His favours and nourishes them with the provision which He gives. He creates them after they were previously nothing mentioned, they were in the wombs of their mothers, in one form of creation after another within three depths of darkness. And He causes provision to reach them, even in the wombs of their mothers, and therefore the body of the fetus develops in the womb of the mother and grows larger, because the provision from Allaah the Perfect and Most High reaches it and nourishment reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the soul is breathed into it so it moves and it comes to life, by the permission of Allaah. This is <em>tarbiyyah</em> (nurturing) in the womb. Then when it comes out, then Allaah the Perfect nurtures it with His favours giving it health and well-being and He causes the milk of its mother to flow for it, so it is nourished until it can eat food and can do without milk. Then little by little its intellect grows and its hearing and seeing develops, it develops little by little until it reaches puberty then it develops further until it reaches its full strength, until it reaches forty years old and it is at the limit of its strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who is it that nourishes it from the day when He created it in the womb of its mother until it dies, who is it who nourishes it, then who is it who causes this food and this drink to be digested and absorbed in its body so that it reaches every cell and every muscle and every place in its body, who is it who makes food and drink appetizing for it, who is it who causes that to pass through and who removes what is harmful from it, who is it who does this and nurtures this human being, is it not Allaah the Perfect and Most High? This is the Lord the Perfect and Most High, the one who nurtures, He is the one who nurtured me and nurtured all of the created beings by His favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything upon the face of the earth from the realms of humans and animals and the realm of the land and the sea, from the greatest created thing to the smallest created thing upon the land and the sea, all of them are nourished by His favours and His provision. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or who is it that could give you provision if your Lord were to withold the provision which He gives to you?</span> </strong>[67:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is no creature upon the earth except that its provision is dependent upon Allaah and He knows its dwelling place and its resting place.</span> </strong>[11:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And how many a creature there is which does not carry its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</span> </strong>[29:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Lord, the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That is Allaah your Lord so worship Him alone.</span> </strong>[10:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then it does not possess and have ability over anything from that, neither the idols nor anything else, no-one else possesses and has ability over granting provision, rather it is one who is provided for, it is a created being like yourself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And He is the One Whom I worship and there is no other whom I worship besides Him, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[1:2]<strong> <sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: the Lord, the One who is like this He is the One who deserves worship from me and from other than me. Then the Shaikh also draws attention to the fact that it is not sufficient to affirm <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Allaah’s Lordship), it is not sufficient that you say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me with His favours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not sufficient, you must acknowledge His right to all worship, and you must make all worship purely and sincerely for Him. And this is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. So the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> affirms the Lordship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and he affirms His sole right to worship, He alone with no partner, whereas the person of <em>shirk, </em>he affirms the Lordship of Allaah, however he is one who associates others along with Him in his worship of Him. He associates along with Him those who do not create and do not provide provision and do not possess anything. This is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. The person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> says, “My Lord is Allaah and He is the One Whom I worship, and I have no other one whom I worship besides Him.”, whereas the person of <em>shirk</em>, he says, “My Lord is Allaah.” However worship with him is not solely for Allaah, so he worships along with Allaah, trees and rocks and beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people and graves. So he becomes a person of <em>shirk</em>, and the affirmation of Lordship does not benefit him, and it does not enter him into Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: meaning the Deity Whom I worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And I have no other whom I worship besides Him</strong>”: neither from the Angels nor from the Messengers nor from the righteous people nor from trees nor rocks nor anything else, I have nothing which I worship besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> with the proof, and this is an intellectual proof, and then he mentioned the textual proof the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All Praise is for Allaah, the Lord and Nurturer of the whole of the creation.</span> </strong>[1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is the start of the Qur’aan in the <em>Mus-haf </em>(written copy of the Qur’aan), there is nothing before it except for, “In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.” And it is the conclusion of the speech of the people of Paradise, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the conclusion of their call will be that all Praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[10:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Majestic and Most High began this creation with this phrase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَاتِ وَالنُّورَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah He Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light.</span> </strong>[6:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He will conclude the creation with it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And judgement will be passed upon them all with justice, and judgement will be concluded by its being said that all praise is for Allaah the Lord of creation</span> </strong>[39:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He began the creation with it and He concluded with it, so it is a tremendous saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying He the Most High, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”</strong></span>: it is praise of the One Who is being praised along with love of Him and veneration of Him. And the, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”, is to make it totally comprehensive, meaning all praise is for Allaah, it belongs to Him and He is deserving of it, so He is the One Who deserves total and unrestricted praise. As for other than him, then he can be praised in accordance with the level of the fine and good things which he does. As for total and unrestricted and complete praise then it is for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because favours, all of them are from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even the created being if he does something good to you, then it is from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He is the One Who caused this created being to do something useful for you, and He is the One Who enabled him to do good for you, so indeed praise returns to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Lillaah</em></span></strong>”: the <em>jaar</em> and the <em>majroor</em> are connected to something left unmentioned which is the predicate for the subject. So the phrase means: praise exists or is confirmed for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah</strong></span>”: means, the One possessing Divinity and the right to be worshipped over the whole of His creation. And this Name, no-one else besides Him, He the Perfect can be called it, no-one can be called Allaah. Even the Pharoah, he did not say, “I am Allaah”, rather he said, “I am your Lord”. So this Name is particular to Allaah, no-one can ever be called it, and no-one has the audacity to say, “I am Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabbi</em></span></strong>”: this is a qualifying noun for Allaah’s Name, and it is in the genitive case and it is a governing noun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”: is a governed noun in the genitive case, and the sign that it is in the genitive case is the, “<em>yaa</em>”. Because it it joined to the sound masculine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that praise, all of it, and extolling, all of it, is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the world of the Angels and the world of inanimate objects and of birds and the world of beasts of prey and the world of animals and the world of insects and of ants and the many worlds or realms of creation that there are upon the land and in the sea, they are not known except to Allaah, and no-one can enumerate them except Allaah. All of them, Allaah is their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”, (the Lord of all of the creation): this cannot be applied except to Allaah the Perfect the Mighty and Majestic. It is not possible for anyone to be called, “<em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it said, “<strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>”, (<em>The</em> Lord): then this cannot be used except for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, it cannot be used except for Him. As for a created being, then the term can be used restrictedly so that it is said, <em>Rabb-ad-Daar</em> “the master of the house”, or, “the owner of the animal”, meaning its owner and its master.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو دعوةُ غيرهِ معهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is to call upon other than Him along with Him.</span></strong><sup>19</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the definition of <em>shirk</em>: it is to call upon other than Him along with Him – meaning that something from <em>‘ibaadah </em>(worship) is directed to other than Allaah, whether it be (to) an angel from the angels or a prophet from the prophets or a righteous person from the righteous people or a building from the buildings or other than that from all the created beings. So whoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah, then this is the greatest thing that Allaah has forbidden. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know the explanation of <em>tawheed </em>and the explanation of <em>shirk </em>because there are from the people those who explain <em>tawheed </em>with other than its true explanation and those who explain <em>shirk </em>with other than its true explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people are those who say, “<em>Shirk </em>is<em> shirk </em>with regards to <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/17/haakimiyyahalbaani/"><em><u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>(judgement and legislation)</a>”. And this has appeared now unfortunately. <em>Al-<u>H</u>ukm bi ghayri ma anzal Allaah  </em>(judging by other than that which Allaah sent down) is a type from the types of <em>shirk </em>called <em>shirk-ut-<u>T</u>aa‘ah </em>(<em>shirk </em>of obedience). There is no doubt that obeying a created being in declaring lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden or in declaring forbidden that which Allaah has made lawful, <em>this</em> is a type of <em>shirk </em> &#8211; however there is that which is more serious than it and it is worshipping other than Allaah by slaughtering and making vows and performing <em>tawaaf</em> (circumambulation) and calling for rescue. So what is obligatory is to warn against all <em>shirk</em>, not to take up something from it and to leave aside that which is worse and more dangerous than it. So <em>shirk </em>is not to be explained as being only <em>shirk-ul-<u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>or <em>shirk </em>in political affairs. And (these people) say: “Shirk of the graves, this is just simple shirk”, meaning it is something easy. This is insolence towards Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. <em>Shirk </em>is the worst thing that Allaah has forbidden and it is to call upon something else besides Him along with Him. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who say that, “<em>Shirk </em>is to have love of the<em> dunyaa </em>(worldly life) and to have love of wealth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wealth is something which Allaah has made beloved (to people) with their natural love.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتُحِبُّونَ الْمَالَ حُبًّا جَمًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you love wealth with immense love.</span> </strong>[89:20]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (man)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is certainly fervent in love of </span><em><span style="color:#008000;">khayr</span> </em></strong>[100:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (of) wealth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كَانَ آبَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَاؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَالٌ اقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَارَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَاكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَجِهَادٍ فِي سَبِيلِهِ فَتَرَبَّصُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: If your fathers and your children…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">are more beloved to you.</span> </strong>[9:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: <strong>‘are more beloved to you’</strong>, and He did not criticize them for loving them (their fathers, their children, etc). Rather He criticized them for giving precedence to love of them over the love of Allaah. Love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is a natural love. The people have need of wealth and they love it; love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is (a case) of love of things which are beneficial through which the people derive benefit. However those people who say these sayings  (that shirk is love of wealth) &#8211; either they are ignorant people who do not know <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>and <em>shirk</em> – or otherwise they are people who deliberately turn away, wishing to turn the people away from these realities towards things which they want and purposes which they desire . And Allaah knows best about people’s intentions and goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that this is not <em>shirk; shirk </em>is to call upon other than Allaah along with Him or to direct anything from the types of worship to other than Allaah  &#8211; such as sacrifice, and making vows, and supplicating and calling for rescue and seeking aid and turning for refuge and fear and hope and other than that &#8211; this is <em>shirk </em>which is the greatest of sins, calling upon other than Him along with Him, He the Perfect and Most High, because <em>ad-Du‘aa </em>(supplication) is the greatest type of worship, just as He, the One free of all imperfections, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُم بِشَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The True Call is that which is for Allaah; and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot respond to them with anything</strong>.</span> [13:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَادْعُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So call upon Allaah, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him even though the disbelievers detest it. </strong></span>[40:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So supplicating to other than Allaah is the <em>shirk </em>which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. As for these lesser matters which they declare <em>shirk </em>to be then that is not the case. However it is to be said: some of them are a part of <em>shirk; </em>however there is that which is more dangerous than it and more important than it because shirk is of levels, some of them are worse than others. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him</span></strong> [4:36] <sup>20</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]:  <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]”:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have said that the proof that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned the rest of the rights (in the rest of the above ayah). So the fact that He began with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and with the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>, this is a proof that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the greatest thing which Allaah has commanded because He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah..</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He followed it with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a prohibition. He began with the command for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the prohibition from <em>shirk</em>. So this proves that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the worst thing that He has forbidden is <em>shirk</em>, because Allaah began with that. And He, the Perfect, does not begin except with the most important thing and then what is next in importance. This is the way in which the <em>aayah </em>is a proof.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبذلك أَمَرَ اللهُ جميعَ الناس وخلَقهم لها</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And that is what Allaah commanded the whole of mankind with and He created them for it</strong></span>.<sup>15</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And that is what Allaah commanded</strong>”: the indication refers to his saying, “That you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him”. And Allaah commanded the whole of the creation with the worship of Allaah making the whole of the religion purely and sincerely for Him, Allaah commanded the whole of mankind the Arabs from them and the non-Arabs, the white and the black from them, all of mankind from the time of Aadam until the last of mankind in the world, Allaah commanded all of them to worship Him, along with making the worship purely and solely for Him. Allaah the most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be from those who fear and are dutiful to Allaah </strong>(who avoid His punishment)<strong>. He Who made the earth a resting-place for you and made the sky a ceiling and He sent down from the clouds rain and He brought out with it from the earth crops and fruits as provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allaah whilst you know. </strong></span>[2:21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there is no rival for Him and there is no-one resembling Him, and there is no-one like Him, and there is no equal for Him. So this is a prohibition of major <em>shirk</em> and lesser <em>shirk</em>. Allaah commanded all of mankind with that from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And He created them for it”: meaning to worship Him alone associating no partners with Him, He the one free of all imperfections, they were created for that purpose, that is just as occurs in His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone.</span> </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they were commanded with that in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind single out your Lord with all worship, the one who created you</span> </strong>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of the saying of the Shaikh, ‘He created them for it, and He commanded them with it’, he combined the two matters in his saying, “And Allaah commanded the whole of mankind with that and He created them for it”, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone</span>. </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind .. </span></strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, He is the Creator, He is the one who created all things, and from that is that He created the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind, and He gave them intellect, and He gave them the duty of worshipping Him alone and not associating anything along with Him. He particularized them with the command to worship Him because Allaah gave them intellects, and He gave them that by means of which they can they can distinguish between what is harmful and what is of benefit, and between the truth and falsehood, and He created all things for their welfare and benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مِّنْهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He has made subservient for you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is upon the earth all of it is a favour from Him. </strong></span>[45:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything has been made subservient for the descendants of Aadam in order that they should use it as an aid upon that which they were created for, and it is the worship of Allaah the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone.</span> </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jinn</em> are a species of beings from the realms of the hidden and unseen, we do not see them, and they have the duty of performing worship and they are forbidden from committing <em>shirk </em>and from sin, just like the descendents of Aadam. However they differ from the descendents of Aadam in their created form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for with regard to commands and prohibitions, then they are just like the descendants of Aadam, they are bound by commands and prohibitions, and the <em>Jinn</em> are a species of beings from the world of the hidden and unseen, we do not see them, however they are present. And mankind, they are the descendants of Aadam. They are called <em>Al-Ins</em> because they are sociable with each other, they come together and they enjoy each others’ company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Jinn</em> are called <em>Jinn</em> from <em>Al-Ijtinaan, </em>which means the state of being hidden. And from it is <em>Al-Janeen</em> (the embryo) in the womb, because it is hidden, and it is said about a person <em>jannahul-layl</em> (the night covered him) when it covers him over, and it is also said <em>Al-Mijann</em> (a shield), that which is taken for protection in war for arrows and so on, so it covers the one who carries it. So <em>Al-Ijtinaan</em> and <em>Al-Janaan</em>, is something which is hidden and concealed. So the <em>Jinn</em> are hidden from us, we do not see them. And they are a species of beings who exist, whoever denies them then he is a disbeliever, since he is denying the truth of what Allaah and His Messenger have said, and denying the consensus of the Muslims, since Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has made clear that He did not create <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Him, not for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He did not create them in order for them to benefit Him or to harm Him nor in order to feel powerful because of them and not feel lowly nor in order to seek increase through them in place of having little because He is <em>Ghaniyy</em> (Independent), having no need of the creation, and He did not create them because of any need for them, He did not create them in order that they should provide for Him or that they should earn wealth for Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I do not want provision from them, and I do not want that they should feed Me. Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong. </strong></span>[51:57-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is not in need of the creation rather He created the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind for one thing alone and it is that they should worship Him, and He is not in need of their worship, rather they are in need of it, since if they worship Allaah, then He honours them and enters them into Paradise. So the benefit of worship returns to them, and the harmful effect of sins is upon them, as for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then He is not harmed by the obedience of the obedient one nor by the sin of the sinful one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِن تَكْفُرُوا أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you people disbelieve, you and everyone upon the earth together, then Allaah is the Independent One, free of all needs, the One deserving of all praise.</strong></span> [14:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not harmed by the sinning of the one who sins and He is not benefitted by the one who is obedient, rather this returns to the creation themselves. If they obey Him then they benefit, and if they disobey Him then they are harmed by sinning against Him.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone </strong></span>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the meaning of, “they should worship”, is, “they should single Me out with all worship.”</span></strong><sup>16</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the meaning of <em>ya‘budoon</em> is <em>yuwa<u>hh</u>idoon</em>”: meaning they single Me out with all worship. So worship and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> have one and the same meaning. <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> can be explained to mean worship, and worship can be explained to mean <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and the meaning of these two is one. So this contains a refutation of those who explain <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> to be affirming that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the One who gives life, the One who gives death, the One who is in control of affairs. This is not the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> for which the creation were created, rather the creation were created for the tawheed of worship which is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Uloohiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who only affirms <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah </em>(<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship), then he is not a <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) and he will not be from the people of Paradise, rather he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire, because he has not come with the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> which he was created for, and with worship.</p>

<p><strong>Previous Class</strong>:<br /> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/07/allaah-created-us-and-gave-us-provision-and-did-not-leave-us-without-purpose/">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Rather He sent a Messenger to us</strong></span>.<sup>4</sup></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>[4]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>



<p>Since it is the case that we may not carry out worship based upon what we think is good nor upon <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) so-and-so and so-and-so from the people, then therefore Allaah sent to us Messengers to make clear to us how we are to worship him, because acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text) it is not permissible that Allaah be worshipped except with that which He has legislated.</p>



<p>So acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> – restricted to text, to that which the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came with. So the wisdom behind sending the Messengers is that they should make clear to the people how they are to worship their Lord, and for them to forbid them from <em>shirk</em> (association of others along with Allaah) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. This is the duty of the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam. </em>And therefore he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عم لا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>



<p><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>So worship is <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text), and <em>bid‘a</em> (innovations) are rejected, and baseless superstitions and ideas are rejected and blind following is rejected. Acts of worship are not taken except from the <em>sharee‘ah </em>(revealed law) which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu alaihi wa sallaam</em> came with.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Rather He sent to us a Messenger</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam </em>the seal, the last one of the Prophets. He sent him to make clear to us why we were created, and to make clear to us how we are to worship Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and to forbid us from <em>shirk </em>and <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) and from sins. This was the duty of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam, </em>and he clearly conveyed the message and he fulfilled the trust which was given to him, and he gave sincere advice to the nation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam, </em>and he explained fully and made clear, and he left us upon a clear white ground, its night is just the same as its day, no-one deviates away from it except one who is destroyed, and this is just as is in His saying, He the Most High:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I completed your religion for you and perfected my favour upon you and are pleased for you with Islaam as your religion</span>.</strong> [5:3]</p>



<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Its checking has preceded. (Mentioned by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 7350 in the Book of clinging to the Book and the Sunnah Chapter 20. And the <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> is reported by Muslim with a fully connected chain as a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa.</em>)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Belief that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.<sup>3</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>The first: that Allaah created us</strong>”: meaning, He produced us from non-existence, so before we were created we were nothing, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَتَىٰ عَلَى الْإِنسَانِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئًا مَّذْكُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Has there not come upon man a time-period when he was nothing worthy of mention</strong>.</span> [76:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said: that is the case, however your Lord has said, “It is easy for Me and I have already created you before, when you were nothing.” </strong></span>[19:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, before he was created was nothing, and the One who brought him into existence and created him is Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Were they brought into existence without any creator, or are they themselves their own creators? </strong></span>[52:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He gave us provision</strong>”: since we need provision, we need food and drink and clothing and habitations and transport and requirements then He the Perfect, He knew our needs, so therefore He made subservient for us whatever is in the heavens and the earth all of it for our welfare in order for us to be able to remain alive, and in order for us to use that to help us upon the purpose for which we were created – which is the worship of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He did not leave us without purpose</strong>”: <em>Al-Haml</em> it means something which is neglected and abandoned which no-one cares about. So Allaah created us and gave us provision for a wise purpose, He did not create us in vain, nor without purpose. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that you were created uselessly and that you will not be returned to us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left without any duties? Was he not previously a drop of semen emitted, then he became a clot, then Allaah created and fashioned him as a human in due proportion? </strong></span>[75:36-38]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاءَ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَاطِلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنَ النَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them without purpose. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!</strong></span> [38:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah only created us and created these provisions for us and these faculties for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous purpose and it is that we should worship Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And He did not create us like cattle, which were created for the welfare of the servants, then they will die and pass away because they are not duty-bound, they were not commanded and they were not forbidden. Rather He created us for His worship, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create <em>jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Me alone. I do not desire from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me. Indeed Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong.</strong></span> [51:56-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He did not create us just for the life of this world that we should live in it and roam  around freely and make merry and eat and drink and make ourselves at home in it and that there is nothing after it. Rather life is a planting-ground and a market place for the next life so that we should equip ourselves in it with righteous deeds. Then we will die and move on from it, then we will be resurrected, then we will be taken account of, then we will be recompensed in accordance with our deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the purpose behind the creation of the <em>jinn</em> and mankind. And the proof for that is many <em>aayahs </em>which prove <em>al-Ba‘ath</em> (the raising to life after death) and <em>an-Nushoor</em> (the resurrection) and <em>al-Jazaa’</em> (the recompensing) and <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the reckoning). And the intellect proves this, because it would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that He should create this amazing creation, and that he should subject this creation to the descendents of Aadam, and then just leave them to die and pass away without any result, this would be futile play, so the results of these deeds must certainly appear in the next abode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, there can be from the people those who spend their whole lives in the worship of Allaah and in obedience to Him, and yet he is in poverty and is needy and maybe he is one who is oppressed and hard-pressed and who suffers difficulty and he does not attain anything from the reward of his actions in this world. And vice versa, that from the people there can be a person who is an unbeliever, an evil atheist who roams around as he wishes and makes merry in this life. He enjoys a life of luxury and he is given whatever he desires, and he commits that which Allaah has made forbidden, and he oppresses the people, and he transgresses against them and he devours their wealth and he kills people without any right, and he overcomes and he behaves tyrannically, and then he dies upon that condition, he has not been struck with anything from punishment. Does it befit the Justice of Allaah the Perfect and Most High and His Wisdom that He should leave this obedient person without any reward and that he should leave this unbeliever without any recompense? This does not befit His Justice, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He has made the next abode to recompense this doer of good for the good which he did, and this doer of evil for the evil which he did. So in it the fruits of deeds will become apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this world is the an abode of action, but as for the hereafter then it is an abode of recompense, either paradise or the fire, and he did not leave us without purpose as is thought by the atheists and the <strong><em>Duhriyyoon</em> </strong>(those who think that death is the end of us). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا مَا هِيَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَا إِلَّا الدَّهْرُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ ۖ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “There is no life except our life in this world, we die and our children live, and nothing brings an end to us except Time.” And they do not have certain knowledge, rather they just surmise.</span> </strong>[45:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of the atheists those who do not believe in the return to life and resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic rebutted them, so He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَنَجْعَلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ كَالْمُجْرِمِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Shall we make the Muslims like the criminals just the same? What is wrong with you how do you judge?</span> </strong>[68:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who truly believe and work righteous deeds, the same in their life and after their deaths? What an evil judgement they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or shall We make those who truly believe and work righteous deeds like those who cause corruption upon the earth, or shall We treat those who are dutiful to Allaah just like the wicked unbelievers? </strong></span>[38:28]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not possible and this will never be the case.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If you see a man striving hard upon worship (<em>ibaadah</em>), living a life of abstention from all worldly comforts consuming himself with worship but he is a person of the innovated sects then do not sit with him and do not listen to his speech and do not walk with him upon any path for I do not feel secure that you will not eventually come to regard his way as something pleasing and thus go to destruction along with him.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">[</b><b style="color:#993300;">Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s &#8220;Four Rules Regarding Shirk&#8221;]</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the <em>Haneefiyyah</em>, the religion of Ibraaheem is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him</strong></span>, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong><br />
</span>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one’s worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one’s worship – spoils it, invalidates one’s actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be achieved by knowing <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/islamic-book-study/the-four-rules-regarding-shirk-al-qawaaid-ul-arbaah/"><strong>Four Rules</strong></a> that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haneefiyyah</em> comes from <em>Haneef</em>, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed; <em>ahbata</em> (invalidates) nullifies; <em>maa doona dhaalik</em> (what is less than that) i.e. what is less than Shirk such as sins and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of <em>AlHaneefiyyah</em>, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face </strong>(i.e. himself)<strong> to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef </strong>(i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)<strong>?”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>: ‘Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he </strong>(i.e. Ibraaheem)<strong> was not from the polytheists.’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So its foundation is: Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong></span><br />
[Surah AdhDhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. Similarly, it is not truthful to call prayer by this name unless (ritual) purity accompanies it, since it is a condition for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this is not so, then if a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and nullifies it, just as an impure occurrence (hadath) causes the (ritual) purity to be spoiled and nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and it to return rejected to the one that performed it, as well as canceling out his deeds, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Had you committed Shirk, we would have surely cancelled out your deeds and you would have indeed been one of the losers”</strong></span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, as Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs </strong>(i.e. verses)<strong>, they are the inhabitants of the Hellfire, wherein they will reside forever – what an evil destination”</strong></span> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then at this point it will become clear that the most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, perhaps he may be set free from this satanic trap, which the Devil has set up in order to mislead the people away from their Lord and into committing Shirk with Allaah. This is the sin that Allaah does not forgive, as He says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship </strong>(i.e. Shirk)<strong>, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this cannot be accomplished unless one knows the following four rules, which Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem is to make one’s worship sincerely for Allaah alone and not mix partners into His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Shirk spoils one’s worship and causes a person’s good deeds to be invalidated. And the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem and what is the proof for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Explain the effect that Shirk has on worship and what it resembles. Give an example for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the most important thing the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn and know?</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 51: Point 88</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that it is befitting that the servant should always have fear and concern for as long as he remains in this world because he does not know what condition he will die upon, what conclusion he will have, knowing what state he will meet Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic even if he performed every good deed.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> And it is befitting that a man who has transgressed greatly to the detriment of his own soul should not give up hope in Allaah, the Most High, at the point of death. Rather, he should have good thoughts with respect to Allaah whilst fearing his sins. So, if Allaah has mercy upon him then it is from His favour and if He punishes him then it is because of his sins.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F387969488&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believer-should-combine-between-fear-hope" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a tremendous matter and it is that the believer (<em>mu`min)</em> should combine <em>al-khawf war-rajaa·</em> (fear and hope) such that in performing his deeds he precedes between fear and hope. So he does not have fear on its own and so therefore despair of the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنَّهُ لَا يَيْأَسُ مِن رَّوْحِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed no-one despairs of the mercy of Allaah except for the disbelieving people.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah</em> 87)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يَقْنَطُ مِن رَّحْمَةِ رَبِّهِ إِلَّا الضَّالُّونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those people who are astray.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ijr (15), <em>aayah</em> 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, </strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O my servants who have transgressed greatly against their own soulsǃ Do not despair of the mercy of Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah</em> 53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he should not fear with excessive fear, which causes him to despair of the mercy of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for this is blameworthy fear. And likewise, he should have hope in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, however, the hope should not take him and cause him to feel secure of the <em>makr</em> (plot or plan) of Allaah. Rather, he should be fearful of Allaah’s plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the plan of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is as befits Him and it is from His perfection. It is not like the <em>makr</em> (plotting) of the created beings, for <em>makr</em> (plotting) in the language is secretly striving for some harm to come upon someone else in a hidden manner such that he is not aware of it. This is what <em>makr</em> means in Arabic. So if that is done for a just cause then it is justice and this is the plotting or planning of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, for He plots against the wrongdoers and the evildoers and causes his punishment to come upon them in a way that they do not perceive and this is justice from Him, He, the Perfect. So He is praised for it but as for if causing harm to come upon someone else is not for a just cause then it is <em>dhulm</em> (oppression) and it is not permissible. And this is the <em>makr</em> (plotting) of the created beings but as for the plotting of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High, then it is something praiseworthy because it is justice and fairness from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So this is the difference between the two matters; between the plotting of Allaah and the plotting of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plot and Allaah plots. And Allaah is the best of those who plot</span>. </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a case of recompense for them. So it is not oppression from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. Rather it comes about as a result of their plotting. They plotted and Allaah plotted against them as a punishment for them. And this is justice from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“One of you may act with the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit; forearms distance and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enters the Fire on account of the fact that he has acted with the actions of the people of the Fire and the recompense comes as a result of the action. And since his conclusion was that he acted with the actions of the people of the Fire, he will enter the Fire and the opposite is the case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a cubit; forearms distance so then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enters it because he performed the actions of the people of Paradise and died upon it. So the Fire will not be entered into except on account of deeds and Paradise will not be entered into except on account of having performed deeds; and deeds are in accordance with their conclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person must not be deceived by his own righteousness or his uprightness and therefore feel secure from deviation. How many believers and how many Muslims and how many scholars Allaah has caused them to deviate when acts of disobedience occurred from them? So a person should not feel secure about himself nor praise his own self. So he should not feel secure from deviation and so on account of it mix with the evil people and listen to them and look into matters of trials and tribulations. He should not feel secure for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful One.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should not feel secure with regard to himself. And the <em>khaleel</em> (the especially beloved one); Ibraaheem <em>`alayhissalaam</em> made supplication (<em>du`a)</em> and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ<br />
رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… And keep me and my children away from worshipping the idols. O my Lord they have led many of the people astray.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah</em> 35-36)<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should not feel secure for himself from being put to trial and from having an evil conclusion even if he is from the most righteous of the people. And he shouldn’t despair of the mercy of Allaah even if he is one of the worst of the disbelieving ones from the people, for Allaah may favour him with repentance so that he dies upon Islaam and therefore enters Paradise. Because as long as he is still alive then he is open to this or that. So the actions are in accordance with their conclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and</strong> <strong>he should have good thoughts with respect to Allaah and he should fear his sins.” </strong></span>He should think good with regard to Allaah and not despair of the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he should fear his sins,”</strong></span> meaning he should not hope with a hope that has no fear with it. Rather, he should gather between fear and hope.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَبًا وَرَهَبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They used to hasten to perform good deeds and they worshipped Us and invoked Us upon hope and fear.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 90)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the Prophets and they used to hasten to do good deeds and worship and invoke Allaah, <em>raghaban</em> (with hope); meaning hoping for His reward and <em>rahaban (</em>meaning fearing His punishment). So the Prophets gathered between fear and hope; they did not take one aspect and leave the other aspect. They did not take the aspect of hope and leave off the aspect of fear and they did not take up the aspect of fear and leave off the aspect of hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the servant should make his thoughts about Allaah good, particularly at the point of death. The scholars said, while the person is in a state of good health, he should cause the aspect of fear to predominate as a precaution and at the point of death, he should cause the aspect of hope to predominate. Because during life he is able to act and to repent and to seek forgiveness but at the point of death, he is not able to do anything so then he should give precedence to the aspect of hope. And therefore, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“One of you should not die except that he has good thoughts with respect to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>if Allaah has mercy upon him then it is from His favour and if He punishes him then it is on account of sin.” </strong></span>This is just as has preceded that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, does not grant bliss to the people nor does He punish them except on account of their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا<br />
</strong><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not oppress anyone.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[13] خالق بلا حاجة، رازق بلا مؤنة</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[13]    He is the Creator without any need, Provider without any difficulty.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F321753442&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [13]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the One who created the creation and He has no need of them.  Rather, He created them just so that they should worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat (51), <em>aayah</em> 56)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He created them not because He had any need of them – that they should aid Him or assist Him or help Him, He the One free from all imperfections, or that they should defend Him.  He only created them so that they should worship Him.  And they (the people) are the ones who need that worship in order to connect themselves to Allaah and to attach themselves to their Lord.  So `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is the connection between the person and his Lord.  So it draws him closer to Allaah, and through it he attains reward from Allaah, and recompense.  So, `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is a need of the creation and it is not a need of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), you and everybody upon the earth, then Allaah is the Independent One who has no need, the One deserving of all praise. </em></span>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), then Allaah has no need of you. </span></em>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (the author’s) saying, <strong>“Allaah is the Provider without any difficulty”</strong>[2] meaning, He is the One who provides all the provision for His servants and that does not diminish what He has with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span>: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, quotes the next two <em>aayaat</em> which come after this one in Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat, <em>aayaat</em> 57 and 58:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">I do not want from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me.  Indeed Allaah, He is the great Provider, the One possessing Power, the Strong.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat (51), <em>aayaat</em> 57-58)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, quotes from the following <u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> qudsee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“&#8230;O my servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you were to stand in one place and ask of Me, and I were to give every person what he asked for, then that would not diminish anything from what I have, except as a needle would diminish the water of the sea when it is placed in it.”</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person shows off in his worship, then this falls under four categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If showing off is the driving force behind doing the act of worship, then the worship is invalid. It is reported in the hadeeth qudsi that Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I am the One, One Who does not stand in need of a partner. If anyone does anything in which he associates anyone else with Me, I shall abandon him with one whom he associates with Allaah.”</span></strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If a person begins his worship sincerely and showing off occurs later at which point he tries to stop showing off, then his worship is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise, if he continues and does not attempt to ward it off, inclining towards it, then one examines whether the latter part of this worship depends on its earlier part or vice verse. For example, with salaah and wudhu, these worships would become invalid in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if the worship is distinguished such that the parts are independent, then whatever occurred before showing off is valid, and whatever occurred after the person began to show off is invalid. For instance, a person gives $50 in charity sincerely. Later, he gives $500 to show off. His first donation is valid while the $500 are invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If a person begins to show off after concluding the worship, then the worship is valid. However, this nullifies the reward for the worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allaah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allaah does not guide the disbelieving people.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah al-Baqarah (2:264)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The showing off is in the descriptive manner of the worship, not its origin. As such, the person initiates the action for the sake of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) but shows off in its description.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, someone begins his salaah sincerely, but he hears someone come, at which point he begins to perfect his salaah more than normal. In this situation, all of that which he added to the sincere part of the salaah will have no reward.</p>

<p><em><span style="color:#808080">The following is excerpted from the Book &#8211; <strong>The Three Fundamental Principles</strong> by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymeen, Translated by Dawud Burbank</span></em></p>



<p>And the evidence for turning repentantly (aI-inaabah) is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;So turn, O you people, repentantly and obediently to your Lord. and submit obediently to Him&#8221;</strong>[78] [Soorah az-Zumar (39):54]</p>



<p>[78] <strong><span style="color:#800000">Al-Inaabah is to turn to Allaah, the Most High, in obedience, and avoiding disobedience to Him, and its meaning is close to that of repentance (tawbah), except that it is more subtle in meaning, and conveys the sense of dependence upon Allaah and fleeing for retuge to Him, and it cannot be except for Allaah, the Most High</span>. </strong></p>



<p>Its evidence is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;So turn, O you people, repentantly and obediently to your Lord. and submit obediently to Him“</strong> [Soorah az-Zumar (39):54]</p>



<p>What is meant by the Saying of Allaah, the Most High. <strong>&#8220;&#8230;submit obediently to Him”</strong> is: Islaam as preseribed and required of us in the Sharee&#8217;ah and that is to submit to the laws and commandments of Allaah. This is because submission to Allaah, the Most High, is of two types:</p>



<p>Submission of all the creation, which is to submit to whatever He has decreed should exist and occur in the creation about which the creation has no choice. So this is general and covers everyone in the heavens and the earth, the Believers and the unbelievers, the righteous and the wicked. No one can possibly disdain and depart from this. The evidence for it is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High.</p>



<p><strong>”And to Him everyone in the heavens and the earth submit. willingly or unwillingly. and to Him you will all be returned.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Aal-‘lmraan (3)283]</p>



<p>Submission to the laws and prescriptions of Islaam, and this is to submit in obedience. This is particular to those who are obedient to Allaah, the Messengers and those who follow them upon good. The evidences for this in the Qur&#8217;aan are many: and from them is the Aayah mentioned by the author [Soorah az-Zumar (39):54]</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Types of the Worship which Allaah has Commanded, and the Proof for Each Type</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قالَ ابنُ كثيرٍ رحمَهُ اللهُ تعالى: الخالقُ لهذهِ الأشياءِ هو المستحقُّ للعبادةِ. وأنواعُ العبادةِ التي أَمَرَ اللهُ بها: مثلُ الإسلامِ، والإيمانِ، والإحسان</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ibn Katheer <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah ta’aalaa</em> said, “the creator of these things He is the One Who deserves worship.” And all the types of worship which Allaah has commanded such as <em>Al-Islaam</em>, and <em>Al-Eemaan</em> and <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em></span>.</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">10</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaikh having explained that the Lord, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped, and having used His saying He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. </strong></span>[2:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as a proof for this, then he used as evidence the speech of Ibn Katheer <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his explanation of the <em>aayah</em>, and he wanted to make clear the types of worship and the proofs for each type. So worship in the language it means: humbling oneself and submission. And from it is the saying, “<em><u>t</u>areequn mu‘abbad</em>”, a well-trodden road, meaning trodden down through being walked frequently upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And worship and servitude is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category is: </strong>servitude which is general to the whole of the creation. All of them are slaves of Allaah, the believer and the disbeliever, the evil-doer and the Hypocrite, all of them are slaves to Allaah, meaning that they are under His control and His overwhelming power, and that it is obligatory upon them to worship Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This servitude is general to the whole of the creation, their believers and their disbelievers, all of them are called slaves of Allaah, meaning that they are creatures created by Him in submission to Him, no-one from them can escape His grasp and His sovereignty, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All those in the heavens and the earth will come to the Most Merciful on the Day of Resurrection as a slave. </strong></span>[19:93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covers everyone who is heavens and the earth, the believer and the disbeliever, all of them will come on the Day of Resurrection in submission to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. None of them has any share along with Allaah the Perfect and Most High in His sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category is: </strong>worship and servitude particular to the believers just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth in humility</span> </strong>[25:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You have no authority over my servants </strong></span>[15:42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Satan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for your chosen servants from them </strong></span>[15:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is particular servitude, and it is the servitude of obedience and of drawing closer to Allaah by means of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And worship in the legislation, </strong>the scholars have differed with regards to its definition, meaning they have differed with regard to the wordings which they use to define it, but the meaning is one. So from them were those who say, “Worship is the utmost humble submission, along with the utmost love”, as was said by Ibn-ul-Qayyim in <em>An-Nooniyyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And worship of the Most Merciful One is to have the utmost love of Him,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>                        Along with humble submission of his servant, they are the two pivots</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he defined it as being having the utmost love along with having the utmost humble submission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who say, “Worship is: that which is commanded in the revealed legislation, not on account of its being something conforming to custom nor something necessitated by the intellect”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because worship is <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (can only be affirmed with texts), it is not established through the intellect nor through customs rather it is only established through the legislation, and this is a correct definition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the fully comprehensive and exclusive definition is that which Shaikh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> defined it with in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Worship is a comprehensive term covering everything which Allaah loves from sayings and actions, the outward and the inward”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the comprehensive exclusive definition, it is that worship is a noun covering everything which Allaah has commanded, so doing whatever Allaah has commanded in obedience to Allaah, and leaving whatever Allaah has forbidden in obedience to Allaah, this is worship, and its types cannot be enumerated, its types are many, everything which Allaah has commanded is worship, and everything that Allah has forbidden, then leaving that thing is worship, whether it is something outward on the limbs or something inward in the hearts it is worship, because worship can be upon the tongue and it can be within the heart and it can upon the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It can be upon the tongue such as saying, “<em>Sub<u>h</u>aan Allaah</em>”, and remembrance of Allaah and saying, “<em>Laa ilaaha ill Allaah</em>”, and stating the two declarations of faith, all the legislated statements of the tongue from the remembrance of Allaah are worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, everything which is within the heart, from that which draws a person closer to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then it is worship, such as <em>al-khawf</em> (fear) and <em>ar-rajaa</em> (hope) and <em>al-khashyah</em> (awe) and ar-raghbah (fervent desire) and <em>ar-rahbah</em> (dread) and <em>at-tawakkul</em> (trust and reliance) and <em>al-inaabah</em> (turning repentantly) and <em>al-isti‘aanah</em> (seeking aid) all of these are actions of the heart. Turning for refuge to Allaah with the heart, and having <em>khashyah</em> (awe) of Allaah and fearing Him and having fervent desire for him and having <em><u>h</u>ubb</em> (love) of Him, He the Perfect and making one’s actions purely and sincerely for Him and having intention which is true and sincere for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, everything within the hearts from these types is worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise worship can be upon the limbs such as the <em>rukoo‘</em> (bowing in the prayer) and the <em>sujood</em> (prostration) and <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause and striving <em>jihaad</em> with one’s person and <em>al-hijrah</em> (migration), all of these are acts of worship of the body and fasting is an act of worship of the body, it is apparent on the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore worship can be upon the tongue, and in the heart and upon the limbs. Then worship is divided into acts of worship performed bodily (<em>badaniyyah</em>) and acts of worship performed through the giving of wealth (<em>maaliyyah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So bodily acts of worship, they are the three types which we have said, they can be upon the tongue and upon the limbs and in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it can be acts of worship performed through the giving of wealth, such as giving the <em>zakaat</em>, and such as spending in Allaah’s cause and it is spending in <em>jihaad</em>. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That they strive in Allaah’s cause with their wealth and their persons </strong></span>[9:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave precedence to the wealth before the persons, so <em>jihaad</em> by means of wealth is an act of worship involving the giving of wealth. And <em><u>H</u>ajj </em>(the pilgrimage) is composed of an act of worship involving the body and an act of worship involving giving of wealth. So carrying out the rites: the <em><u>t</u>awaaf</em> and the <em>sa‘ee</em> and the <em>ramy-ul-jimaar</em> (the casting pebbles) and standing in ‘Arafah and spending the night in Muzdalifah, these are acts of worship involving the body. And as for the spending (on your <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>), then it is an act of worship involving giving wealth, because <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> requires spending.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. He Who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and He sent down from the clouds rain, and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you, so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him. </strong></span>[2:21-22]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>9</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">9</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped</strong>”: meaning, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped, as for other than Him, then it does not deserve worship, because it is not a Lord. This is the intent of the speech of the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his saying, “<em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped”, meaning He is the One Who deserves worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also it is not sufficient that a person just affirms <em>Ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship), rather he must affirm <em>Al-‘Uboodiyyah</em> (Allaah’s deserving all worship), He the Perfect and Most High, and he must carry it out making it purely and sincerely for Him, the Perfect and Most High. So since he has affirmed that He is <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) then it is binding upon him to affirm that he is <em>Al-Ma‘bood</em> (the One Who therefore deserves to be worshipped), and that others besides Him do not deserve anything from worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof that worship is particular to the Lord is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. He Who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and He sent down from the clouds rain, and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you, so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him. </strong></span>[2:21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind</strong>” <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ</strong> </span>: this is a call from Allaah to the whole of mankind, the believers and the unbelievers, for Allaah has mentioned in this <em>soorah, soorat-ul-Baqarah</em>, that mankind is divided into three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first category:</span> </strong>are the believers, those who truly believe in the hidden and unseen and who truly believe in the Last Day. And He has described them as being the ones who are successful in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They (the believers) are upon guidance from their Lord and they are the ones who are the successful ones </strong></span>[2:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second category</span>: </strong>are the unbelievers, those who openly display disbelief and obstinate rejection. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed those who obstinately disbelieve, it is the same whether you warn them or you do not warn them, they will not believe. </strong></span>[2:6]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third category: </strong></span>the Hypocrites, who are not with the disbelievers, and they are not with the believers:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ لَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ وَلَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Wavering in between, being neither fully with these nor fully with those </strong></span>[4:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are believers outwardly, however they are disbelievers inwardly, and they are worse than the disbelievers who openly display their unbelief, and therefore He sent down ten and more <em>aayahs</em> with regard to them, whereas regarding the believers He sent down just a few <em>aayahs</em>, and regarding the disbelievers two <em>aayahs</em>. As for the Hypocrites, then He began mentioning them from His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from the people are those who say, “We believe”</span> </strong>[2:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">up to His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The lightening almost snatches their sight away </strong></span>[2:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is regarding the Hypocrites because of the severity of their danger and of the foulness of their action. And having mentioned these three types, He then said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind </strong></span>[2:21]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a call to all of the types, the believers and the disbelievers and the Hypocrites. The scholars have said: the first call occuring in the <em>Mus-<u>h</u>af </em>(written copy of the Qur’aan) is this:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, worship your Lord </strong></span>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Worship</strong>!”: this is a command, meaning make all worship purely and sincerely for Him. Why? Because He is your Lord, and worship is not correct except for the Lord, the Perfect and Most High. Then He mentioned the proof for that, and it His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He Who created you </strong></span>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And those who came before you</strong>”: from the nations, all of them. Allaah the Perfect and Most High created the angels and the <em>jinn</em> and mankind and all of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>So that you should have <em>taqwaa</em> (be dutiful to Allaah seeking to avoid His anger and punishment)</strong>”: if you reflect upon this, so then perhaps this will result for you in <em>taqwaa </em>(dutifulness to Allaah), if you reflect that He is the One Who created you and created those who were before you, perhaps you will seek then to protect yourselves from Him, He the Perfect and Most High in worshipping Him, because nothing can protect from His punishment except obedience to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. Perhaps you will seek to protect yourselves from His Punishment and seek to protect yourselves from the Fire, because nothing will protect from it except the worship of your Lord Who created you and those who came before you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He continued the mention of evidence for His Lordship and His right to worship, He the Perfect and Most High with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He Who made for you the earth as a resting place” </strong></span>[2:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning like a carpet:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ بِسَاطًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah has made the earth as a carpet laid out for you</strong></span> [71:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning laid out and, “as a carpet”, meaning which you use as a carpet, you sleep upon it and you build upon it, and you cultivate crops upon its surface and you travel about upon it on your journeys to wherever you want to go. So the earth is a carpet and a resting place:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْأَرْضَ فَرَشْنَاهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَاهِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have laid out the earth as a carpet for you and what an excellent spreader of it We are. </strong></span>[51:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For your welfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And the sky as a canopy / ceiling</strong>”: so the sky is a ceiling for the earth and it contains things which result in the welfare of the servants.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He sent down from the clouds in the sky rainwater and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that there is no Lord besides Him </strong></span>[2:22]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 11: <strong>Shaving the Head<br />
<a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj<br />
</a>By  Shaykh AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, are indeed four well-known actions which are the stoning, the slaughter, shaving the head and then the Tawaaf. The discussion here will be about shaving the head or shortening the hair as worship for Allaah in obedience to Him and seeking closeness to Him on this great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaving is completely removing the hair of the head while shortening is lessening the hair of the head all over. Shaving or shortening the hair is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah, it is not permissible to leave it, and the evidence is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qadaamah –Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If it was not from the rites of Hajj, Allaah would not have described them this way.’</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to Makkah he ordered his Companions to make Tawaaf of the House and of Safa and Marwa, then to come out of Ihraam and shave or shorten their hair.’</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah. So whoever does not shave or shorten their hair, then it is necessary to atone for this by slaughtering a sacrificial animal. It (i.e. shaving/shortening) is a sign that the time period for Ihraam has ended and it imitates the actions of the Messenger &#8211; alayhi as-sallat wa sallam- where he shaved his head and ordered his Companions to shave their heads, casting aside their impurities and removing dishevelled hair. Shaving the head is the act of humbly placing the forehead in front of its Lord, due to His greatness, and in submission due to His Honour and it is from the most intense forms of Uboodiyah (worship) for Allaah Azza Wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Muslims performs this great act of obedience and important worship in reverence of Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- it is obligatory upon him to <strong>know that shaving the head or shortening the hair is done to worship and seek closeness to Allaah and that it is not permissible to perform it for anyone other than Allaah –subhanahu wa Ta’ala</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah–</strong></span> was asked about a people who shave their heads at the command of their shaykhs at such graves as they glorify while regarding it as a means seeking closeness to Allaah and worship: is all of this a Sunnah or a Bida? Is shaving the head, generally, a Sunnah or Bida?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –Rahimullaah- replied: <strong>‘Shaving the head is of four types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>One of them is shaving the head in Hajj and Umrah</strong></span> and this is from what Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have ordered. It is legislated and ordered in the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are multiple narrations on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamthat he shaved his head in his Hajj and Umrah as did his Companions. From them were those who shaved their heads and some who shortened their hair. Shaving is better than shortening because <strong style="line-height:1.5;">the Prophet said: ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said: ‘And those who shorten their hair.’</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the farewell Hajj he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded the Companions who had brought a sacrificial animal with them to shorten their hair if they had performed Tawaaf of the House and had walked between Safa and Marwa for Umrah and then to shave their heads once they had completed the Hajj. So (in this way) he combined for them, firstly, shortening their hair and, secondly, shaving their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second type of shaving the head</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">is for a need</span>, such as shaving the head for treatment</strong>. This is also permissible according to the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Indeed Allaah has permitted the Muhrim (pilgrim), for whom it is not usually allowed to have his head shaved until completion of the Hajj rites, to shave his head if he is suffering as Allaah Ta’ala mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and do not shave your heads until the Hady (sacrificial animal) reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity &#8211; feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [Baqarah :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been established by agreement of the Muslims is the hadeeth of Ka’b bin Ujraah that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- passed by him in the Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyah lice were falling from his head, so the Prophet said to him: ‘Are your lice harming you?’ K’ab replied: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Shave your head and sacrifice a sheep, or fast three days or feed a group of six needy people.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authenticity of this Hadeeth is agreed upon and has been received with acceptance by all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third type of shaving the head is that which is done for worship, religion and Zuhd (abstention from loving worldly things) in other than Hajj or Umrah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, some of the people command the one who repents, once he has repented to shave his head. Similar is the one who shaves the head as a sign of being from the people of rituals and religion or as a sign of the perfection of Zuhd and worship or as a sign that the one who shaves is better, more religious or has more Zuhd than the one who does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are those who adhere to certain shaykhs such that if they repent, they shave their heads or they cut some of his hair. So the shaykh specifies who should have the scissors and prayer rug so he can pray on that rug (and not with the Muslims). His cutting hair from the heads of the people is from the complete authority befitting him and someone who is imitated in order to make the people repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So all of this is Bida’ which has neither been commanded by Allaah, nor by His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</strong>. It is not obligatory nor has it been recommended by any one scholar of the Deen. Not one of the Companions did this, nor did any of those who followed the companions in goodness, neither the scholars of the Muslims who were well known for Zuhd and worship nor the Companions, the successors or those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were those who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- but he never used to order them to shave their heads if they entered Islaam nor did he cut anyone’s hair. He didn’t pray on a rug but, rather, he used to pray as an Imaam with all the Muslims. He used to pray on what they used to pray, sit where they used to sit and he never used to make himself distinct from them by sitting on something special, whether a prayer rug or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes this Bida’ -which is not obligatory or even recommended- as a means of seeking closeness and obedience or as a path to Allaah making it a completion of the Deen or orders the repentant to do it, both the Zahid (the one who abstains from loving worldly things) and the worshipper, then he is a misguided person outside the path of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah the Most Merciful), following the footsteps of the Shayateen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh ul-Islaam –Rahimullaah- mentioned <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>the fourth type of shaving the head</strong></span> which is shaving the head as other than a ritual or for other than a need, neither seeking closeness to Allaah nor seeking to be religious. He mentions that the people of knowledge have two opinions regarding this, which are two narrations attributed to Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that it is disliked and this is the Madhab of Maalik and others. The second is that it is permissible and this is well known amongst the companions of Abu Haneefa and ash-Shafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Ahmad mentions the evidence that the scholars use for each of these sayings. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> mentions a similar division to what has preceded in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Ma&#8217;ad&#8217;. He mentions that from the different types of shaving the head there is one that is Shirk and one that is Bida’. <strong>Shirk being the one shaving his head for other than Allaah –Subhaanhu- such as those who follow shaykhs and who shave their heads for their shaykhs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I have shaved my head for so-and-so and you have shaved your head for soand-so.’ This is the same as saying: ‘I have done Sadjah (prostration) for so- and-so,’ because shaving the head is done with humility, in worship and with submissiveness and it is done for the completion of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions that the misguided shaykhs deceive their followers by causing them to shave their heads for them, just as they mislead them into prostrating to them. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is clear Shirk and a great lie, we ask Allaah for security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 2:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">Is there a meaning for &#8216;Ibaadah (worship) such that it is possible for us to know of? Does it have a general and a specific meaning?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Yes. Its general meaning is as I have indicated earlier, namely the submission to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with love and awe by doing that which He commands and avoiding that which He has forbidden, and in the manner set forth by His legislations. This is the general meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The specific meaning, i.e. its meaning in detail, then, as Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is a comprehensive name covering whatever Allaah loves and is pleased with, both sayings and actions, the apparent and the hidden, such as fearing (Khawf), having awe (Khashyah), having true trust and reliance (Tawakkul), Prayers (Salaat), Zakaat (obligatory charity), Fasting (Siyaam) and the like, from the ordinances of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if you mean that the general and specific meaning [of &#8216;Ibaadah] is what has been mentioned by some scholars, namely that &#8216;Ibaadah is either <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kawniyyah</strong> </span>or <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shar&#8217;iyyah</span></strong>, meaning that man could be in a Kawniyyah and Shar&#8217;iyyah state of submission to Allaah, then the Kawniyyah worship is a general one, comprising the believer and unbeliever and the righteous as well as the wicked, due to the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to Ar-Rahmaan as a slave.</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat Maryam (19): 93].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore all that is in the heavens and the earth is, in the universal sense (Kawnee), submitting to Allaah, The One free from all imperfection. None can stand to oppose Allaah or work against Him in whatever He wants as to His Universal Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the specific worship, <strong>al-&#8216;Ibaadah ash-Shari&#8217;yyah</strong>, which is the submission to Allaah, the Most High&#8217;s, Shar'(legislation), then this is specific to the believers in Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, who carry out His Command. Then some of this is more specific and some is less. The more specific worship is like that of the Messengers &#8216;alyayhimussalaatu was salaam as signified in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur&#8217;aan) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم).</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, sooart al-Furqaan (25): 1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. Qur&#8217;aan) to Our slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), then produce a Soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful.</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat al-Baqarah (2): 23],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And remember Our slaves, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq, and Ya&#8217;qoob, [all] owners of strength [in worshipping Us] and [also] of religious understanding,</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat Saad (38): 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the likes of these ayaat describe the Messengers, &#8216;alayhimus-salaat was-salaam, with al-&#8216;Uboodiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 3:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">Would those specifically choosing al-&#8216;Ibaadah al-Kawniyyah and excluding al-&#8216;Ibaadah ash-Shar&#8217;iyya, be rewarded?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer</strong>: Those will not be rewarded for it, because they are submitting to Allaah willingly or unwillingly. And so man may get sick, turn poor, and lose(s) his beloved ones having no desire whatsoever for this. In fact, he dislikes it. But this is submission to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in the universal (Kawnee) sense.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely, guide them to Our paths (i.e., Allah&#8217;s religion &#8211; Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun (gooddoers)&#8221;.</span> </em>(29:69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And worship your Rubb until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death)&#8221;.</span> </em>(15:99)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it&#8221;.</span> </em>(99:7)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The submission and obedience of man to His Creator is the essence of Islam. The Name “Islam” is chosen by God (Allaah) and not by man. It is the same message revealed to all the prophets and Messengers by Allaah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its final and universal form it was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم: may Allaah exalt his mention and save him and his message from all kinds of evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the identifying name or title of the Majestic, sole and True God. This noun which is the name of Allaah applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and Most High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name Allaah is the ma’looh (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing). He is the Creator: to Him belongs the Commandment. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Elijas, Malcom’s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Gurus, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too), Diana, light fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), Saints, Priests, Monks, Haile Selassie, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!! All are created beings or things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Allaah is not chosen by man and it is not named after a prophet, saint or any famous man. The name “Allaah” was referred to by all prophets including Adam, Jesus, Moses, and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as the One true God who deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate nature in man (fitrah) recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allaah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes nor does it relax towards associating human qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son”, and that “everyone is born with an original sin”. They “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material world”. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!” not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “origin god” of Rome: The god of desire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete code for life which requires man to fulfill the purpose for his presence on earth. Allaah does not want for man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men, desire, or sex. He provides the proofs that he is the One who can deliver man from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him. He is the Last, everything ends except Him; the Most High, nothing is above Him; the Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach and his compassing, and He is the Most High in His nearness. He is the Ever-Living, to Him we shall all return, where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not beget nor is He begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel (Injeel) as a message to the Children of Israel. A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him. A man who needs to eat, walk, sleep, rest, etc. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need, but Allaah, the God of Jesus, is far above any imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafarianism, etc., all are forms of worship to created beings/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a nationalistic belonging to Allaah: “The Tribal God” of Israel. Men and women following these religions were born with the natural inclination of worshipping their Creator, Allaah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. Once they are exposed to the Signs of Allaah around them, or in the Qur’an, or to someone who triggers their Fitrah (natural inclination to worship Allaah alone), the reverting process begins, and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many distortions of Islam in the media, worldwide. However, Despite the wrong practices of some Muslims (rulers and ruled) in some countries, those who seek the truth are judging Islam according to its doctrines. That is why we continue to witness a global growth in the number of people accepting this true religion of Allaah. The opposition to Islam will intensify with the spread of this truth in the world. This is not a conflict of “civilizations”, but rather the real struggle between the truths presented in the creed and principles of Islam and false doctrines and ways of worship. This is a real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allaah’s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breathe? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? So is it our right to ignore our Creator when we are all need of Him? Allaah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One and only one True God. It is the religion of submission to the Will and Commandment of the One Who brought us to life, the Ever Living who will never die. It is the complete way of life for all mankind. All these qualities are chosen by Allaah in His only religion: Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that you will come with an open heart to read the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, because none can expose the truth better than the Word of Allaah. The Qur&#8217;an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in Arabic and it is not authored by him for he was unlettered. The translations of its meanings into many languages are available in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may want to know how does one become a Muslim. In order to become a Muslim one must openly recite ash-shahaadah (the profession of faith): La ilaaha illallaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah which means that there is no true god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. This means that there is no god worthy of being worshipped but Allaah, and that He must be worshipped only according to the teaching of His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Those teachings are best understood by the Prophet’s companions, and those who rightfully follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. They are called as-salaf as-saalih (the Righteous Predecessors). May Allaah, the Most High, guide us all to this path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">’<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Abd</strong> </span>[Lit. ‘slave’]. Mankind and Jinn are ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibaad</strong> </span>(singl.‘abd) of Allaah meaning they surrender to Allaah’s Universal Pre-decree, none is able to escape His Pre-ordainment, because they are a Creation of His. So, whether believers or non-believers in Allaah, they are, in the general sense, slaves [‘Ibaad] of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto Ar- Rahmaan (the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything) as a slave.&#8221;</em> </span>[Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 93].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer, however, who devotes his worship to Allaah alone, is distinguished as being a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>slave-worshipper</strong></span>” to Allaah. In this sense, the term ‘Abd is specific as being the “slaveworshipper” of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave (‘Abd) of Allaah, who obeys Allaah, is a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>worshipping slave</strong></span>.” In the general sense, he is part of the creation and thus he is also a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>submissive slave</strong></span>.” The Kaafir, however, is a “submissive ‘Abd” in the general sense only. The believing slaves fulfill the exclusive meaning of the ‘Uboodiyyah. And the‘Uboodiyyah of the Messengers (‘alayhimus- Salaam: May Allaah protect them from all kinds of evil) is the very special slavery to Allaah, Most High. None can compete with the Messengers’ degree of ‘Uboodiyyah to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<p><strong>When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</span> </em>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></span>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> “So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em> “So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, commerce is of two types – <strong>the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter)</strong>. The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.”</span></em><strong><em> </em></strong>[Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.”</strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></span>[Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong></span>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).”</span> </em>[Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.”</strong></span> So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on some people who say: &#8220;O Allah, I worship You out of my love for You. If I worship You fearing Your Hell, let me enter it and if I worship You seeking to enter Your Paradise, let me enter Your Hell&#8221;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Worshiping Allah just by loving Him is the Manhaj (methodology) of misguided Sufis, which is of their own invention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loving Allah is the highest degree of Ibadah (worship), but not the sole act of Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Manhaj of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) is to worship Allah through love, fear, hope and other expressive forms of `Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord withhumility and in secret</strong></span>.&#8221; [Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about His Prophets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.&#8221;</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"> [</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about the angels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they stand in awe for fear of Him.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 28]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 62:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As regard those who bequeath that the Faatihah be recited on behalf of the Prophet’s soul, or on his behalf by the Prophet’s grave?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not binding to execute this bequest, because it is a bequest of an unprescribed matter. For the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) does not prescribe for anyone to worship Allaah and then dedicate the reward of worship to the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam). Since, had this been prescribed, then the companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, would have been the most preceding people in attaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also because the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is in no need for this. For indeed there is no person who does a righteous deed except that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) would have a similar reward. Because he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is the one who has directed to this, and, [as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said]: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who guides to what is good is like the one who does it.”</span></strong> [92] So, this bequest is from the <strong>foolish</strong> and <strong>futile</strong> actions as well as a <strong>bid’ah</strong>, something which has not been reported from the righteous predecessors, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And similarly if he said: “Recite the Faatihah on my behalf by the Prophet’s grave,” then it is not binding to fulfill this bequest. The reason for this is that <strong>specifying a particular place for a particular worship not prescribed by the sharia, is from the bida’</strong> as it is known in the aforementioned discussion pertaining to the issue of “Pursuance of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).” [93] And that the following of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) cannot be achieved until the act of worship agrees with the Sharee’ah in six matters: <strong>cause, type, extent, manner, time, and place</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Reported by at-Tirmithee (no.2672, Arabic). And also in saheeh Muslim: “One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer”, vol.3, no.4665.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A Doubt and its Rebuttle<br />
<strong>Question 15:</strong> What lead to this question is that nowadays there is a group of people when they are called to worship Allaah they say: “Allaah is the Rabb of the hearts.” We would like also that you comment on this response?</p>

<strong>Question 16:</strong> Briefly, what is the meaning of Eemaan [faith] and its pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Relation of Eemaan to the Hadeeth of Jibreel (alaihissalam)<br />
<strong>Question 17:</strong> Is the aforementioned meaning the same as that which came in Prophet’s (alaihissalam) answer to Jibreel’s question about Eemaan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 18:</strong> If a person is asked about Eemaan, should he say that it means the attestation that obligates acceptance and submission, or should he say that it means to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers as the Messenger صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم explained?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Meaning of Eemaan And Its Pillars<br />
<strong>Question 19:</strong> We would like to expound on the meaning of Eemaan and also know of its pillars?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/05/12/dahrees-deny-the-existence-of-allaah-and-claim-that-ad-dahr-time-manages-world/">How to Respond to the Dahrees</a><br />
<strong>Question 20:</strong> We know that the Dahrees, who are many nowadays and who are considered from the intellect because they think and infer, are agreed upon the belief in the non-existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. So, how to respond to people like this?</p>

<strong>Question 21:</strong> What are the Pillars of Eemaan?</p>
<p>The Belief in the Angels<br />
<strong>Question 22:</strong> Are there other things related to the belief in the angels?</p>

<strong>Question 25:</strong> How can the belief in the Last Day be?</p>
<p>The Belief in al-Qadar<br />
<strong>Question 26:</strong> What about the pillar of belief in al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Increase and Decrease of Eemaan (Faith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 27:</strong> Does Eemaan increase or decrease? What are the things that make it increase or decrease?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 28:</strong> There are those of the opinion that Eemaan neither increases nor decreases, and that sin wipes out Eemaan entirely, and that the person who commits it becomes a Kaafir! How to respond to those people?</p>
<p>Denying that Eemaan Increases and Decreases</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 29:</strong> But what is the Islamic Ruling vis-à-vis the unattestation to the increase and decrease of faith?</p>
<p>The Manner of Judging by other than that which Allaah has revealed</p>
<p><strong>Question 30:</strong> What is the manner of judging by other than what Allaah has revealed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Difference Between the Thaalim (Transgressor) and Faasiq (Disobedient Sinner`)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 31:</strong> You mentioned, however, about the Faasiq and the Thaalim things that are close, or possibly intermixed. And it is that the Thaalim rules by that which Allaah has not sent down whilst knowing that Allaah’s Judgment is better. But that he intends to gratify his thirst for revenge from someone. So he applies a judgment on someone that Allaah has not approved of. And then the Faasiq rules while knowing the Judgment of Allaah and that it is the right Judgment, but because of his own interest or lowly desire, or due to a certain bias to fulfill the desires of someone else, he rules by that which Allaah has not sent down. So what is the difference between the two?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYING (Fortune-Telling)<br />
<strong>Question 32:</strong> What is Soothsaying?</p>

<p>The Reality of Magic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 38:</strong> You mentioned in your talk that astrology is a form of magic, so what is magic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 39:</strong> What is meant by subtleness in your saying, “Magic is everything that is subtle and whose cause is hidden”?</p>
<p><strong>Question 40:</strong> What is the legal judgment regarding magic and its learning?</p>
<p>Is There a Reality to Magic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 41:</strong> Is magic a true thing, or it is just conveying doubts, and fantasies to the people?</p>
<p>The Relation of Divination with Magic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 42:</strong> You mentioned divination and you defined the fortune-teller as well as the magician. Is there, however, a connection between divination and magic?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 43:</strong> It was reported from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he was bewitched. So we would like you to talk about the means by which he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was bewitched. Furthermore, is it contradictory to the status of Prophethood that bewitchment of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) took place?</p>

<p><strong>Question 44:</strong> What is Ilhaad–concerning Allaah’s Names and Attributes?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Types of Shirk</p>

<p>Defining the Types of Shirk</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 46:</strong> We knew the types of shirk, but is there a specific definition for each type of it?</p>
<p>Is the relinquishing of worship called Shirk?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 47</strong>: It was mentioned, as in the narration reported by Saheeh Muslim, the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): “Verily between man and between Shirk and Kufr (unbelief) is the abandonment of prayers.” –Is the abandonment of worship considered Shirk?</p>
<p>The Reality of the Deen of Islaam?</p>
<p><strong>Question 48:</strong> What is the Religion of Islaam?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 54:</strong> Is it necessary that the characteristics in the four matters: ‘Aqeedah, worship, manners and transaction be totally or completely present without diminution? And in case anything of it is gets diminished, does this take the person out of the folds of the saved group or it doesn’t ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 55:</strong> Is there something you want to add concerning the qualities of the saved sect?</p>
<p>The Correct and False Tawassul</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh</b><b> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </b><b>concerning</b><b> the difference between `Ibadah and obedience</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 A.H.,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </span>sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tufayl&#8217;s, </span>his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the President of the Islamic University in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah </span>and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Milbar </span>living in the country told me that Your Eminence opine that <em>`Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, </span>owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah</strong></span>. This matter needs more elaboration. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied when tainted with Shirkas Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3" target="_blank" name="NorwillyouworshipthatwhichIworship"></a>&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nor will you worship that which I worship</span></strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3</span> . Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (Exalted be He) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (Exalted be He) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which do not involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly.</strong></span> There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#003300;">The Four Principles of &lt;&lt;You (Alone) We Worship&gt;&gt; </span><br />
<span style="color:#003300;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#003300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Four Principles</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; is built upon four principles which comprise conviction in what Allaah and His Messenger love and are pleased with from the statements of the tongue and the heart and from the actions of the heart and the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Uboodiyaah</em> (servitude to Allaah) is a comprehensive title for these four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the real people of &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;are the people of these four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the statement of the heart, it is the belief in what Allaah <em>–Subhanahu-</em>informed of about His Self, His Names and His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels and the meeting with Him; as was revealed upon the tongues of His Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the statement of the tongue, it is information of Allaah and His Names and Attributes….etc.  Calling to and defending that, clarifying the falsity of <em>Bida’</em> -which opposes Allaah – establishing His remembrance and conveying His commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions of the heart include having love for Him, reliance upon Him, turning repentantly to Him, fear of Him and hope in Him, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him, having patience upon His commands and prohibitions and upon what He has decreed, being pleased with that and with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, having obedience to Allaah and loyalty to Him, having submission for Him and humility and being subservient to him, having serenity with Him as well as other actions of the hearts whose obligation is greater than that of the actions of the limbs and whose recommended actions are more beloved to Allaah than the recommended actions of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions of the limbs without the actions of the hearts are either lacking in or are of little benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the actions of the limbs then they are like prayer and striving, moving one’s feet to <em>Jumu’ah</em> and the congregational prayer, helping the weak one and being good to the creation etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; is adhering to these four rulings and accepting them and &lt;&lt; and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt; Is requesting help upon these principles and having the capability to perform them. &lt;&lt;Guide us to the Straight Way&gt;&gt; consists of knowing these two matters (&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt;) in detail, the guidance to establish them and to have the methodology of the path of the righteous in seeking Allaah with these principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Da’wah</em> of the Prophets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers did indeed invite to &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all of them invited to the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and to having sincerity of worship for Him, from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh <em>–alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> said to his people: &lt;&lt; ‘Worship Allaah! You have no other <em>Ilâh</em>(God) but Him.’ &gt;&gt; [al-‘Araaf: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Hood, Salih, Shuaib <em>–alayhimus-salaam &#8211;</em> and Ibraheem <em>–alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> said.  Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allaah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) <em>Tâghût</em> (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût </em>besides Allaah).’ &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And We did not send any Messenger before you except that We inspired him (saying): <em>Lâ ilâha illa Ana </em>[none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).’ &gt;&gt; [Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O (you) Messengers! Eat of the <em>Taiyibât </em>[all kinds of <em>Halâl </em>foods], and do righteous deeds. Verily! I am Well-Acquainted with what you do. And verily! This, your religion (of Islaamic Monotheism) is one religion, and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. &gt;&gt; [Muminoon: 51-52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Characteristic of <em>Uboodiyaah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala made <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (servitude to Allaah) a characteristic of the most perfect of His creation and as such made them close to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Messiah will never be proud and reject to be a slave of Allaah, nor the Angels who are near (to Allaah). And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself. &gt;&gt; [Nisa’:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Surely, those who are with your Lord (Angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. &gt;&gt; [Ara’af: 206]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this explains there being a complete stop in the saying of Allaah in Soorah Anbiyaa &lt;&lt; To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. &gt;&gt; Stop here  then resume reading from &lt;&lt; And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship). They (i.e. the angels) glorify His Praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so). &gt;&gt; [Anbiyaa: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are two complete separate sentences, i.e. indeed to Allaah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth as a slave and Angel.  Then resumed with another sentence, He said: &lt;&lt; And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him &gt;&gt; i.e. that the Angels who are there are not too proud to worship Him such that they do not worship him haughtily with rejection, nor would they scorn or reject worshipping Him, nor are they (too) arrogant to worship, nor do they tire so that they become heedless of it, nor do they cease.  Rather, their worship of Allaah and their distancing Him from imperfection is the same as breathing is to the son of Adam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the first is the characteristic of the slaves of Allaah with regards to Allaah’s<em>Ruboobeeyah</em> (Lordship) and the second is the characteristic with regards to the slaves of Allaah’s <em>Ilaaheeyah</em> (Worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 63] to the end of the Soorah[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allaah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. &gt;&gt; [Insaan: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and remember Our slave Daawood,&gt;&gt; [Saad: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And remember Our slave Ayoob, &gt;&gt; [Saad: 41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And remember Our slaves, Ibrahim, Ishaaq, and Ya’qoob &gt;&gt; [Saad: 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said about Sulayman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)! &gt;&gt; [Saad: 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said about the Messiah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He [‘Iesa] was no more than a slave. We granted Our Favour to him &gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah made ‘Isa’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> goal to be <em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) and not <em>Ilaaheeyah</em> (being worshipped), unlike what his enemies, the Christians have done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah describes the noblest of His creation and the highest of them to Him with the status of <em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah), which is the noblest of ranks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad Peace be upon him)&gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad) &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has sent down to His slave (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur’aan)&gt;&gt; [Kahf: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah spoke about His slave with <em>Uboodeeyah</em> in regards to the revelation of the Book (Qur’aan) to him and likewise in regards to the challenge of bringing something similar to the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It has been revealed to me that) When the slave of Allaah (Muhammad) stood up supplicating to (his Lord Allaah) in prayer to Him they (the Jinns) made around him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet’s recitation). &gt;&gt; [Jinn: 19] So Allaah mentions him with Uboodeeyah in the matter of giving Dawa’ to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him] Who took His slave for a journey by night &gt;&gt; [Isra’: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentions him with <em>Uboodeeyah</em> in the matter of the night journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh on the authority of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said: ‘Do not over praise me like the Christians over praised the son of Maryam.  Indeed I am a slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth: ‘I am a slave. I eat what a slave eats and sit like a slave sits.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <em>Saheeh</em> of Bukhari on the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr who said: ‘I read the description of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the Torah: Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah, My slave, My messenger, I named him al-Muttawakil, he does not have evil manners nor is he hard-hearted.  He was not one to raise his voice to compete in market places, he will not respond to evil with an evil, but he will pardon and forgive.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – Subhanahu – gave absolute glad-tidings and signs for His worshippers, where He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So announce the good news to My slaves, those who listen to the Word [good advice <em>Lâ ilâha ill-Allâh</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) and Islaamic Monotheism, etc.] and follow the best thereof (i.e. worship Allaah Alone, repent to Him and avoid <em>Tâghût, </em>etc.) &gt;&gt; [Zumar: 17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah provided them with absolute security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It will be said to the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism): My worshippers! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve, (You) who believed in Our <em>Ayaat</em>and were Muslims (i.e. who submit totally to Allaah’s Will and believe in the Oneness of Allaah – Islaamic Monotheism).&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 68-69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytaan had his authority over Allaah’s slaves, specifically, cut short and he placed his authority over the one who aligned himself with him and associated partners with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the <em>Ghâwîn</em> (<em>Mushrikûn</em> and those who go astray, etc.).&gt;&gt; [Hijr: 42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan) and those who join partners with Him (Allaah) [i.e. those who are <em>Mushrikûn</em> &#8211; polytheists]. &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 99-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> made <em>Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) of<em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) the highest level of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Jibraeel – when Jibraeel asked the Messenger about <em>Ihsaan</em> – ‘Worship Allaah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then know that He sees you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ vol 1 p.120</p>
<hr size="1" />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &lt;&lt; And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness. And those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing. And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily! Its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.’ Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to dwell. And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). And those who invoke not any other <em>ilâh </em>(god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islaamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance. And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.And those who, when they are reminded of the <em>Ayât</em> of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat. And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the <em>Muttaqûn</em>“(pious) Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein; excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to dwell. Say: ‘My Lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to Him. But now you have indeed denied (Him). So the torment will be yours for ever (inseparable permanent punishment).’ &gt;&gt;[Furqan: 63-77]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: Introduction of his treatise &#8220;Haqeeqat-ut-Tasawwuf&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds. He completed for us the Religion, perfected for us His blessing, and chose Islaam for us as a Religion, commanding us to cling onto it at the time of death, as He says: <b>“O you who believe, fear Allaah as He ought to be feared, and do not die except while you are Muslims.”</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same instruction that Ibraaheem and Ya’qqob gave to their children: <b>“Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya’qoob and he said to his children: ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said: ‘We will worship your God and the God of your forefathers, Ibraaheem, Isma’eel and Ishaaq – one God and to Him we submit as Muslims.’”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, send Your peace and blessings upon Your servant and messenger – our prophet, Muhammad – and upon all of his family members and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To proceed:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has created mankind and jinn for the purpose of worshipping Him, as He states: <b>“And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.” </b>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their honor, dignity and happiness in this life and the Hereafter lie in this matter (of worship). This is because they are in need of their Lord – They cannot separate themselves from their need for Him for even a moment, whereas He stands in no need of them and their worship, as Allaah says: <b>“If you are ungrateful (by disbelieving), then verily, Allaah is not in need of you.” </b>[Surah Az-Zumar: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“And Moosaa said: ‘If you disbelieve – you and everyone else on earth – then verily, Allaah is Rich (in need of no one), Most Praiseworthy.” </b>[Surah Ibraaheem: 8]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Worship is the right that Allaah has over His creatures, however, its benefits return back to them. So whoever refuses to worship Allaah, he is an arrogant <strong>rejecter</strong>. And whoever worships Allaah but also worships someone else besides Him, he is a <strong>polytheist</strong>. And whoever worships Allaah alone based on that which He did not legislate, he is an <strong>innovator</strong>. And whoever worships Allaah alone according to what He has legislated, he is a <strong>monotheist believer</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Allaah’s servants are in critical need of worship and they are unable to grasp its true nature – which Allaah is pleased with and which is in conformity with His Religion – on their own, Allaah did not entrust them to themselves. Rather, he sent messengers to them and revealed Books in order to clarify the meaning and nature of this worship, as He said: <b>“And We have sent to every nation a messenger, (saying): Worship Allaah and avoid the false deities.” </b>[Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“And We did not send before you a messenger except that We revealed to him that: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Me, so worship Me alone.’” </b>[Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever opposes what the messengers have clarified and what the Books have revealed concerning the Worship of Allaah, and worships Allaah according to what his taste dictates, what his soul desires and what the devils among mankind and jinn have made seem fair to him, then he has deviated from Allaah’s Path, and his worship will not be in reality worship of Allaah. Rather, it will be <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">worship of his desires</span></strong>. Allaah says: <b>“And who is more astray than he who follows his desires without any guidance from Allaah.” </b>[Surah Al-Qasas: 50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These types of people are many amongst mankind, and at the head of their ranks are the <strong>Christians</strong>, as well as those who have deviated among the sects of this ummah, such as the <strong>Sufis</strong>, for indeed they have devised guidelines in worship that are in opposition to what Allaah has legislated in many of their religious practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This becomes clear when we clarify the true meaning of worship as has been legislated by Allaah upon the tongue of the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), and also when we clarify the deviations in the meaning of this worship, which the Sufis are upon today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The worship that Allaah has legislated is founded upon firmly established principles and rules, which can be summarized as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">First</span>: </b>Worship is dependent upon revelation. This means that there is no room for personal views in it. Rather, the only one who has the right to legislate what is and isn’t worship is Allaah, as He said to His Prophet: <b>“So stand firm and straight as you have been commanded, as well as those who turn in repentance with you and transgress not.” </b>[Surah Hood: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“Then We placed you upon a religious legislation (Sharee’ah) from the Commandment (of Allaah), so follow it. And do not follow the desires of those who don’t know.” </b>[Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said, quoting His Prophet: <b>“I only follow what has been revealed to me.” </b>[Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">Second</span>: </b>Worship must be done sincerely for Allaah’s sake and it must be free from any traces of Shirk (polytheism), as Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>“So whoever hopes to meet his Lord, then let him perform righteous deeds and not mix any partners into the worship of his Lord.”</b>[Surah Al-Kahf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if any aspect of Shirk (polytheism) mixes in with worship, that worship becomes nullified, as Allaah says: <b>“And if they commit Shirk, all the good deeds they used to perform would surely become invalidated from them.” </b>[Surah Al-An’aam: 88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“And it has indeed been revealed to you and to those before you (that): ‘If you mix partners in the worship of Allaah (Shirk), then surely, all your good deeds will be cancelled out and you will certainly be from among the losers. Nay, but rather worship Allaah alone and be from among the grateful.” </b>[Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">Third</span>: </b>The person we follow with regard to worship and the one who clarifies it to us is none other than the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), as Allaah says: <b>“You indeed have in the Messenger of Allaah a good example.” </b>[Surah Al-Ahzaab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“And whatever the Messenger gives you, then take it. And whatever he forbids you from, then refrain from it.” </b>[Surah Al-Hashr: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with our Command (i.e. Sunnah), then it is rejected.” </b>[Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration: <b>“Whoever introduces something new into our Command (i.e. Sunnah), which is not part of it, it is rejected.” </b>[Agreed Upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Pray as you have seen me praying.” </b>[Agreed Upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Take from me your religious rites (i.e. of Hajj).”</b>[Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many more textual proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fourth</span>: </b>Worship is confined to specific time-frames and limitations, which one is not permitted to challenge or transgress, like the prayer for example. Allaah says: <b>“Verily, the prayer is enjoined upon the believers at fixed times.” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is the Hajj (Pilgrimage). Allaah says: <b>“Hajj (occurs) in well-known months.”</b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 197]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we also have the example of fasting. Allaah says: <b>“The Month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Qur’aan – a guide for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever sights the (crescent indicating the) month, then he must observe the fast.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fifth</span>: </b>Worship must be founded upon love for Allaah, as well as submission to Him and fear and hope in Him. Allaah says: <b>“Those who they call upon (in worship), they themselves seek a way to their Lord, as to which of them is nearest to Him. And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Punishment.” </b>[Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says about His prophets: <b>“Verily, they used to rush to do good deeds, and they would call on Us, longing (Our reward) and dreading (Our punishment), and they would humble themselves submissively before Us.” </b>[Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“Say: ‘If you truly love Allaah, then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allaah is Most-Forgiving, Bestower of Mercy.’ Say: ‘Obey Allaah and the Messenger. But if you turn away, then verily Allaah loves not the disbelievers.’” </b>[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 31-32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, Allaah mentions the signs that indicate one’s love for Allaah, as well as its fruits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for its <strong>signs</strong>, then that is in:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(1) Following the Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(2) Obeying Allaah and the Messenger.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for its <strong>fruits</strong>, then they are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(1) Achieving Allaah’s love,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(2) Forgiveness of sins, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(3) Mercy from Him.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">Sixth</span>: </b>The obligation of performing worship does not get removed from a sane-minded individual that is responsible for his actions from the time he attains puberty to the time he dies. Allaah says:<b>“And do not die except while you are Muslims.” </b>[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“And worship your Lord until certainty (i.e. death) reaches you.” </b>[Surah Al-Hijr: 99]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 14<br />
Moderation in Worship</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Qur&#8217;an unto you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) to cause you distress&#8221;.</b></span><b> (20:1,2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you&#8221;.</b></span><b> (2:185)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>142.</b>  Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came in when a woman was sitting beside me. He asked me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</span> I said: &#8220;She is the one whose performance of Salat (prayer) has become the talk of the town.&#8221; Addressing her, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(What is this!) You are required to take upon yourselves only what you can carry out easily. By Allah, Allah does not withhold His Mercy and forgiveness of you until you neglect and give up (good works). Allah likes the deeds best which a worshipper can carry out constantly&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>143.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Three men came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to inquire about the worship of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). When they were informed, they considered their worship insignificant and said: &#8220;Where are we in comparison with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while Allah has forgiven his past sins and future sins&#8221;. One of them said: &#8220;As for me, I shall offer Salat all night long.&#8221; Another said: &#8220;I shall observe Saum (fasting) continuously and shall not break it&#8221;. Another said: &#8220;I shall abstain from women and shall never marry&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to them and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Are you the people who said such and such things? By Allah, I fear Allah more than you do, and I am most obedient and dutiful among you to Him, but still I observe fast and break it; perform Salat and sleep at night and take wives. So whoever turns away from my Sunnah does not belong to me&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>144.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ruined are those who insist on hardship in matters of the Faith.&#8221; He repeated this three times.</span><br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>145.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The religion (of Islam) is easy, and whoever makes the religion a rigour, it will overpower him. So, follow a middle course (in worship); if you can&#8217;t do this, do something near to it and give glad tidings and seek help (of Allah) at morn and at dusk and some part of night&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>146.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came into the mosque and noticed a rope stretched between two poles. He enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What is this rope for?</span>&#8221; He was told: &#8220;This is Zainab&#8217;s rope. When during her voluntary prayer, she begins to feel tired, she grasps it for support&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Untie it. You should perform prayers so long as you feel active. When you feel tired, you should go to sleep&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>147</b>.  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you feels drowsy during prayer, let him lie down till drowsiness goes away from him, because when one of you performs prayers while feeling sleepy, he does not know whether he seeks forgiveness or abuses himself&#8221;.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>149.</b>  Abu Juhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made a bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abud-Darda&#8217;. Salman paid a visit to Abud-Darda&#8217; and found Umm Darda&#8217; (his wife) dressed in shabby clothes and asked her why she was in that state. She replied: &#8220;Your brother Abud-Darda&#8217; is not interested in (the luxuries of) this world. In the meantime Abud-Darda&#8217; came in and prepared a meal for Salman. Salman requested Abud-Darda&#8217; to eat (with him) but Abud-Darda&#8217; said: &#8220;I am fasting.&#8221; Salman said: &#8220;I am not going to eat unless you eat.&#8221; So, Abud-Darda&#8217; ate (with Salman). When it was night and (a part of the night passed), Abud-Darda&#8217; got up (to offer the night prayer) but Salman asked him to sleep and Abud-Darda&#8217; slept. After some time Abud-Darda&#8217; again got up but Salman asked him to sleep. When it was the last hours of the night, Salman asked him to get up and both of them offered (Tahajjud) prayer. Then Salman told Abud-Darda&#8217;: &#8220;You owe a duty to your Rubb, you owe a duty to your body; you owe a duty to your family; so you should give to every one his due. Abud-Darda&#8217; came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and reported the whole story. Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Salman is right&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>150.</b>  `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was informed that I said that I would perform prayers the whole night and observe fasting every day as long as I live. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is it you who said this?</span>&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I ransom you with my parents, it is I who said that.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will not be able to do that. Observe fast and break it; sleep and get up for prayer, and observe fast for three days during the month; for every good is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to fasting the whole year.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I can do more than that.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Observe fast one day and leave off the next two days.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have strength to do more than that.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Observe fast every other day, and that is the fasting of Dawud (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and that is the most moderate fasting&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That is the best fasting.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;But I am capable of doing more than this&#8221;. Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is nothing better than this.&#8221;</span> `Abdullah bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with them) said (when he grew old): &#8220;Had I accepted the three days (fasting during every month) as the Messenger of Allah had said, it would have been dearer to me than my family and my property&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O `Abdullah! Have I not been informed that you observe fast during the day and offer prayer all the night.&#8221;</span> I replied, &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah!&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that. Observe fast for few days and then leave off for few days, perform prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right upon you, and your eyes have a right upon you; and your wife has a right upon you; your visitors have a right upon you. It is sufficient for you to observe fast three days in a month, as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting the whole year.&#8221; I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have strength.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Observe fast like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> and do not fast more than that.&#8221;</span> I said: &#8220;How was the fasting of Prophet Dawud?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Half of the year (i.e., he used to fast on every alternate day).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards when `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) grew old, he used to say: &#8220;Would that I had availed myself of the concession granted to me by Messenger of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I have been informed that you observe fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur&#8217;an) every night.</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;Messenger of Allah! It is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good,&#8221; whereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then observe fasts like the fasting of Prophet Dawud (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as he was the most ardent worshipper of Allah; recite the Qur&#8217;an once every month</span>.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of doing more than that.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then recite it (the complete Qur&#8217;an) in every twenty days.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;O Prophet of Allah I am capable of reciting more than that.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then recite it once in every ten days.</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Prophet of Allah! I am capable of reciting more than that.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then recite it once in every seven days, but not recite more than that</span>.&#8221; The Prophet of Allah also said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You do not know, you may have a longer life&#8221;</span>. When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the concession (granted to me by) the Prophet of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The best fasting with Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud, and the best prayer with Allah is that of Dawud (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for he would sleep half of the night and stand for prayer for the third of it and (then) would sleep sixth part of it; he observed fast one day and leave off the other. He would not flee on meeting the enemy&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration `Abdullah is reported to have said: My father helped me marry a noble woman and he used to inquire of his daughter-in-law regarding her husband. She would say: &#8220;He is, indeed, a fine man. Since I have come to him, he has neither stepped on my bed nor he has had sexual intercourse with me&#8221;. When this state of affairs lasted for some time, my father mentioned the matter to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who directed my father saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Send him to me&#8221;.</span> I went to him accordingly. He asked me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How often do you observe fast?</span>&#8221; I replied; &#8220;Daily&#8221;. He asked me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How long do you take in reading the Noble Qur&#8217;an completely.</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;Once every night&#8221;. Then he narrated the whole story. He (in his old age) would recite one seventh of his nightly recitation to some members of his family during the day to lighten his task at night. Whenever he wished to have a relief from his fast on alternate days, he would give up fasting for a few days and make up deficiency later by observing the number of fasts he had missed. He would not give up the number of fasts altogether because he did not like to abandon what he had settled with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>151.</b>  Hanzalah Al-Usayyidi (May Allah be pleased with him) who was one of the scribes of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), reported: I met Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) he said: &#8220;How are you O Hanzalah?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Hanzalah has become a hypocrite&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Far removed is Allah from every imperfection, what are you saying?&#8221; I said, &#8220;When we are in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he reminds us of Hell-fire and Jannah, we feel as if we are seeing them with our very eyes, and when we are away from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we attend to our wives, our children, our business, most of these things (pertaining to life hereafter) slip out of our minds.&#8221; Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;By Allah, I also experience the same thing&#8221;. So Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) and I went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and I said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), Hanzalah has turned hypocrite.&#8221; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What has happened to you?&#8221; I said,</span> &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, when we are in your company, and are reminded of Hell-fire and Jannah, we feel as if we are seeing them with our own eyes, but when we go away from you and attend to our wives, children and business, much of these things go out of our minds.&#8221; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand is my life if your state of mind remains the same as it is in my presence and you are always busy in remembrance (of Allah), the angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your roads; but Hanzalah, time should be devoted (to the worldly affairs) and time should be devoted (to prayer)&#8221;.</span> He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said this thrice<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>152.</b>  Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: While the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was delivering Khutbah (religious talk), he noticed a man who was standing, so he asked about him and was told that he was Abu Israel who had taken a vow to remain standing and not sit, or go into the shade, or speak while observing fasting. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Tell him to speak, to go into the shade, to sit and to complete his fast&#8221;.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al- ‘ Uthaymeen</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This revised edition, produced with the permission of the author and the translator, includes some corrections to the original translation, changes to the English, the addition of the Qur’aanic text, changes to the translations of the meanings of the Qur’aan and hadeeths, changes in the system of transliteration of Arabic terms, and the addition of references and some explanatory notes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In response to our request to publish this revised edition, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen wrote : “ Wa- alaykum us – salaam wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh. As <strong>Dr. Saleh As–Saleh</strong>  has authenticated the translation of the booklet, I have no objection for you to print it on the condition that it will not have any copyright if we want to print it again. Written by Muhammad ibn Saalih Al – Uthaymeen, dated 1/9/1418 hijri. The booklet mentioned is the booklet on fasting.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al- ‘Uthaymeen. <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>All praise is due to Allaah, and may Peace and blessings be on His Messenger Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF RAMADHAAN </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated that Allah’s Apostle صلي الله عليه وسلم said, <strong>“ When the month of Ramadhaan starts, the gates of Jannah (Paradise) are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and satans are chained.”(1)</strong> The gates of Jannah are opened in this month because a great deat of righteous deeds are performed, and as an encouragement for those who seek Allaah’s reward. The gates of Hell are closed because few sins are committed by believers. The Satans will be chained so that they may noy have the chance they have in other months to whisper into the hearts of the believers and misguide them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has prescribed fasting and it obligatory upon all nations. He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">) يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ) (البقرة:183)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O you who believe ! fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al – Muttaqoon (the pious).</strong> [Al- Baqarah (2) : 183]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If fasting were not a great act of worship, and the reward thereof were not so great, Allah would not have Presceibed it on all nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the virtues of fasting is that it is a means for atonement of sins. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه that the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said :<strong> “ He who observes the fast of the month of Ramadhaan out of sincerity and hope for the reward from Allaah will have his past sins forgiven.”(2)</strong> That is, when fasting is observed out of belief and without resentment to it as an act of worship or doubt in its reward, Allaah will forgive the past sins of the one who observes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه reported the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم as saying : <strong>“ Allaah said: All the deeds of Adam’s children belong to them, except fasting, which belongs to me and I will reward it. Fasting is a shield (against the Hell and against the commission of sins). If one of you happens to be fasting he should avoid sexual relations with his wife, and should avoid quarrelling. Should someone fight or quarrel with him let him say, ‘ I am fasting.’ By Him in Whose hand my soul is, the smell of the month of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allaah than that of the musk.”(3)</strong> It is a shield because it safeguards the believer from vain talk and wrongdoing, and hence protects him from Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of all the good deeds, Allaah has favored fasting to be greatly rewarded by Him and distinguished it with prestige when it is observed with the pure intention to please Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting is so meritorious for a believer that he will have two occasions of joy. The first is at the time of breaking his fast, when he enjoys the bounties of Allaah because he has been favored with Allaah’s mercy to observe the fast while many others have been deprived of this great blessing. He will rejoice in the second occasion when he meets his Lord and enjoys the abundant reward for having observed fasting (4). In addition to this, fasting intercedes with Allaah on behalf of the believer on the Day of Judgment.(5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> WHEN DOES FASTING BEGIN AND END ? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting begins upon sighing the new moon. Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">) فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ)(البقرة: من الآية185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong><strong>So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadhaan), he must fast that month.</strong> [Al- Baqarah (2) : 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is not incumbent on everyone to sight the new moon. Rather, if a trustworthy Muslim testifies that he has sighted it, then everyone must observe fasting. Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated : “ A Bedouin came to the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم and reported, ‘ O Prophet, I have seen the new moon of Ramadhaan.’ Thereupon the prophe صلي الله عليه وسلم asked the man, <strong>‘Do you bear witness that “ Laa ilaaha illaaah”.</strong> ( i.e. there is no god worthy of being worshipped beside Allah) ?’ ‘ I do,’ said the bedouin. The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم further asked him whether he testifies that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The Bedouin affirmed that, too. Thereupon, the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم asked Bilaal رضي الله عنه to announce to the people to begin their fast the next day.”(6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘ Umar رضي الله عنه also confirmed the practice of sighting the new moon in his report : “ The People were seeking the new moon. Having sighted it myself, reported it to the prophet. صلي الله عليه وسلم He began his fast and ordered the people to begin theirs, too.”(7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who sights the new moon of Ramadhaan must inform those in authority in the Muslim government or community. Once the Muslim government announces the beginning of Ramadhaan upon the sighting the new moon it becomes binding on the rest of Muslims to begin their fast.(8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be borne in mind, however, that astronomical calculations must be ruled out from the sharee’ah and must not be relied on for sighting the moon, as the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم has ruled that Muslims must begin their fast upon seeing the new moon, not upon calculating the month astronomically. It is only when it becomes hard to see the new moon due to weather conditions when Muslims may complete the month of Sha’baan, which precedes Ramadhaan, as Thirty days.(9) The lunar month is either 29 or 30 days. It has neither fewer nor more days.(10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>WHO SHOULD FAST AND WHO SHOULD NOT ? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting is obligatory on the mature sane and healthy Muslim. Those who are immature (i.e. young children) are encouraged to fast. Exempted are those who suffer terminal illness, or are too old to fast. Allah does not overburden His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Permission to abstain from fasting is granted to the travelers who do not travel for the purpose of breaking their fast. Even though it is permissible to break fast durning travel, it is praiseworthy to fast while traveling if no hardship imposed. In any case, travelers should make up the days they missed fasting in Ramadhaan once Ramadhaan is over and they are back home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those whose sickness does not allow them to fast, they fall into three categories:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>If it is neither hard nor harmful for them, they must observe fasting.</li>
<li>If it is hard, but not harmful for them, they are permitted to break their fast.</li>
<li>If it is harmful for them, then they must abstain from fasting.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is stated in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">) يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لا تَأْكُلُوا أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَاطِلِ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ تِجَارَةً عَنْ تَرَاضٍ مِنْكُمْ وَلا تَقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيماً) (النساء:29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>) وَلا تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ)(البقرة: من الآية195) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do not kill yourselves.</strong> [An- Nisaa’ (4) : 29] – Baqarah (2) : 195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم was reported to have said, <strong>“ There is (to be) no harm or reciprocating harm.”(13) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The days that are missed in Ramadhaan must be made up once Ramadhaan is over.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the monthly period or period of post-natal bleeding, women are to abstain from fasting,(14) but must make up the days they missed after the fasting month is over. The Pregnant or breastfeeding woman whose health or the health of the suckling baby might be affected by fasting should break her fast and make up the missed days after Ramadhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also recommended for those who engage in combat in the way of Allah to break their fast. The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم told his companions in one of the battles, “ You are going to meet your enemy in the morning, abstaining from fasting is better for your strength, so break your fast.” (15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE WISDOM BEHIND FASTING </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting is a great act of worship the Muslim performs by turning away from his own desires in order to please his Lord, hoping for His reward. Common sense dictates that one would not give up desired things except for the sake of more desirable ones, in this case the pleasure of Allah, which is the most sought after desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also a means if achieving piety and righteousness. The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, <strong>“ He who does not give up forged speech and evil actions, Allah needs not his refraining from eating or drinking.”(16)</strong> In other words, Allah does not accept his fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heart, through fasting, is inclined to maintain its tenderness since the desires are not sought, but rather shunned, and thus the heart tends to be more receptive to the words of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rich person will, through fasting, be more appreciative of Allaah’s graces and bounties. He also will suffer the deprivation the poor and needy experience under normal circumstances. Thus he will be motivated to help them. Fasting helps depress pride or egoism and maintains humbleness. Moreover, fasting has health advantages by means of decreasing the intake of food and relaxing the digestive system. Great is the wisdom of Allah, and great are His Graces !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>OBLIGATORY CONDITIONS OF FASTING </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Performing the other acts of worship and duties is most important, and salaah is of particular importance, as without it no other act of worship is accepted by Allah.(17) Praying in congregation is a great aspect in our religion. Everyone should attend.(18) Its reward is twenty seven times greater than that which is performed individually.(19) At one time the prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم was about to burn the houses on those who did not attend the congregational prayers.(20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refraining from bad behavior such as lying, cheating, music, smoking, backbiting and slandering others to create animosity among them. The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, “ <strong>No slanderer shall enter paradise</strong>.”(21) The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, “ <strong>There will exist in</strong><strong> ummah those who will deem unlawful things lawful (such as) fornication, silk for men, intoxicating beverages and musical instruments.”</strong>(22) my</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PRAISEWORTHY ETIQUETTE OF FASTING </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Taking the meal of suhoor. The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“ Take (the meal of) suhoor because there is blessing in it.”</strong>(23) <strong>He also said: “ The difference between our fasting and that of the people of the book is taking the meal of suhoor.”</strong>(24) Even taking a cup of water in lieu of a meal for suhoor has blessing in it, too.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Breaking the fast as soon as the sun sets.(25)</li>
<li>Making du’aa upon breaking fast.(26)</li>
<li>Reciting as much Qur’aan as possible during the monthe of Ramadhaan.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PRACTICES WHICH BREAK THE FAST </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Sexual intercourse in the daytime. The willful violation of the fast by this practice requires the fast of sixty consecutive days in order to make up for the day in which the intercourse took place.(27)</li>
<li>Whllful ejaculation by means of kissing or caressing, etc. Wet dreams and unintentional ejaculation do not break the fast.</li>
<li>Eating, drinking, smoking or taking any food substitutes, such as receiving blood, glucose, or I. V. substances while observing the fast.</li>
<li>Willful, not unintentional, vomiting.</li>
<li>Menstrual bleeding.(28)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Days in which the above practices 2 through 5 took place are to be made up a day for a day once Ramadhaan is over.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the application of kuhl ( surmah), eye, ear or nose drops do not break the fast; they are neither food nor a substitute thereof. Wearing perfumes, using the siwaak or toothbrush without toothpaste do not break fast since it has been reported that the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم used to do so.(29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QIYAAM OR TARAAWEEH PRAYER </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has made five daily prayers obligatory on the Muslims, which He, due to His Grace, made the reward thereof fifty-fold.(30) He also encourages the believers to perform supererogatory of naft prayers. Among these is the night prayer which falls between midnight and dawn. Allah praised those who engage themselves in prayer at night:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ) تَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً)(السجدة: من الآية16) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their sides forsake their beds to invoke their Lord in fear and hope ….</strong> [As- Sajdah (32):16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said : <strong>“ The best prayer next to obligatory is the night prayer.”(31) </strong>In another tradition he said<strong> : “O people ! Spread the (Islamic) greeting (i.e. by saying ‘ assalaamu alaykum”), give the food (to those who need it), connect your relatives (by visitation) and pray at night while the others are asleep, and you shall enter Jannah peacefully.”(32)</strong> Of the night prayer is Witr, the minimum of which is one rak’ah and maximum of which is eleven rak’ahs.(33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Performing night prayer in Ramadhaan is far more superior to the performing in any other month by virtue of its recommendation by the prophet, صلي الله عليه وسلم who said, <strong>“Whoever prayed at night in it ( i. e. Ramadhaan) out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.”(34)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taraaweeh prayer is considered the night prayer in Ramadhaan, and, therefore, one should take good care the observe it, To pray taraaweeh in jamaa’ah (congregation) is a sunnah initiated by our beloved prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم and revived by the second Rightly-Guided Khaleefah, Umar رضي الله عنه (35) Though there has been a difference if opinion among the scholars in the past as to how many rak’ahs taraaweeh should be, all of them unanimously agreed that the best is to apply the sunnah of performing it with eleven rakahs only. The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم did not pray more than eleven rak’ahs in Ramadhaan or any other month. ‘ Aa’ishah, the wife of the prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, “ The prophet never prayed more than eleven rak’ahs at night in Ramadhaan or in any other month.(36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full reward of taraaweeh is obtained only when it is performed in jamaa’ah. The person who performs it in jamaa’ah will be considered, according to authentic tradition, as if he spent the rest of that night praying.”(37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF RECITING THE QUR’AAN. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of Qur’aan recitation :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Practical recitation, which means reading with belief in and application of the orders of Allah and refraining from the unlawful things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Word recitation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many hadeeths in which emphasis is laid on the great reward for those who recite the Qur’aan. The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, <strong>“ The best of you is he who learns the Qur’aan and teaches it.”(38) He also said : “ The one who excels in reciting the Qur’aan will be in the company of the honored angels.”(39) And, “ The example of the believer who reads the Qur’aan is like that of the utrujah (a citrus fruit) which has a beautiful fragrance and a beautiful taste. While the example of the believer who does not read the Qur’aan is like that of the date fruit : It has sweet taste, but has no fragrance.”(40)</strong> He also said : <strong>“ He who recites </strong><strong>One letter of the Book of Allaah, will be rewarded for it, and the reward will be multiplied in folds.”(41) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are certain soorahs of the Qur’aan that have more reward for their recitation. The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم verified that Satan does not enter the house wherein Soorat Al- Baqarah(42) is recited. When one recites Ayaatul-Kursi(43) at the night, as the prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم informed us, he shall be protected by Allah, and Satan shall not come near him till he wakes up in the morning.(44) The same results may be achieded by the recitation of the last two verses of Soorat Al- Baqarah,(45) as well as the last three soorahs of the Qur’aan.(46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our pious predecessors used to busy themselves extensively in reciting the Qur’aan during the month of Ramadhaan. It was customary for them not to go beyond ten verses before they learned the rulings and the knowledge those ten verses contained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ETIQUETTES OF READING THE QUR’AAN </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan which we recete contains the actual words of Allah revealed to Muhammad صلي الله عليه وسلم . Therfore, we should observe the following when recition it :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Seek refuge in Allah before reading it (viz. أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ A’oothu billaahi minash – shaytaanir-rajeem)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2, Have the intention that the recitation thereof is purely to seek the pleasure of Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Recite with an alert heart that you may comprehend its contents, imagining while reciting it that Allah is speaking to you though the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Make sure you are clean before touching the Qur’aan. Do not read it when you are in the state of impurity.(47)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Do not read the Qur’aan in lavatories or similar places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Read it slowly with pleasant sound and rhythm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Prostrate wherever a verse requires prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF THE LAST TEN DAYS OF RAMADHAAN AND LAYLAY AL-QADR </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that the Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم used to put extra effort in his devotion in the last ten days of Ramadhaan.(48) He used to awaken his family in the night that they may not lose the benefit of those bledded nights.(49) It is also reported that he used to make ‘ ittikaaf by spending the last ten days in the masjid.(50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Laylat al Qadr means the night of honor and decree. It is sometimes erroneously into the night of power. The Prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم recommended to be sought in the last ten days of Ramadhaan. This night is valued to be better than a thousand months spent in devotion to Allah. One of the privileges of this night is that the Qur’aan was revealed in it. In it too, the angels descend to earth with blessings, goodness and mercy (51) . It is a peaceful night in which many are saved from the Hell. Forgiveness of past sins is granted to those who spend it busying themselves in prayer and the remembrance of Allah. (52) The prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, <strong>“Seek it in the odd nights of the last third of Ramadan.(53) </strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">8. “Some scholars take into account the divisions amongst the Muslim countries related to the beginning and end of fasting. They advise that in the absence of one Khilaafah governing all Muslims, It is incumbent upon Muslims to follow their repective coutries as to when to fast and when to break the fast. This minimizes the divisions occurring within the same country where people fast according to different rulings.” (See Shaykh Al – ‘ Uthaymeen’s Ash- Sharh Al- Mummti” ‘ alaa zaadil- Mustaqni,” vol.6, p. 322 and Shaykh Al – Albaani’s Itmaa’tul- Minnah fee at- Ta’leeq ‘ alaa fiqhis-sunnah, p. 398). According to Shaykhul- Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, “ The criteria upon which fasting becomes bound upon Muslims is that the informantion regarding the moon sighting reaches them in a reasonable amount of time to be able to act upon it.”</p>

It should also be noted that it is not permissible to fast a day or two before Ramadhaan thinking that it might be Ramakhaan. Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه reported that the prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم said, <strong>“ None of you should pre-empt Ramadhaan by fasting a day or two before it, except for a man fasting his usual fast, then let him fast that day.”</strong> ( Saheeh Al- Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 3, # 138)</p>

In a fatwah (religious ruling), the Shaykh further explained that the fasting of a person who engages in forbidden speech is not invalidated, but its reward is diminished. The gravity of his sin may be such that it outstrips any reward for his fasting. [ Fataawa As – Siyaam ( Riyadh : Maktabt Al- Furqaan, n.d.)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. This is based upon the ruling of one group of scholars that whoever abandons the salaah is a kaafir, and thus, none of his deeds are accepted. The basis for this ruling is several hadeeths in which the prophet صلي الله عليه وسلم indicated that abandoning the prayer is disbelief, such as, <strong>“ Between a man and shirk and kufr is only the abandonment of the salaah.”</strong> [ Muslim and Ahmad; Saheeh Al Jaami As sagheer, # 2848] Another group of scholars divides those who do not pray into categories, judging them according to their intention.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Source: Ad-Dawah ilalLaah Magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most beautiful this about the concept of worship in Islaam is the truly unique way in which it incorporates the feelings of love, fear and hope within the hearts of the worshippers of Allah. Understanding how to combine these three qualities into the worship (&#8216;ibaadah) of Allah is one of the most essential things that every Muslim must grasp, ,not least because every sect which has drifted from the Straight Path has strayed in this aspect of worship. The deviation of the other Religions in this regards is clear for all to see: &#8220;God is Love! Jesus is Love!&#8221; say the Christians, denying the fact that God should be feared too. As for the Jews, then their hearts are filled only with hope &#8211; hope in the belief that the Fire will not touch them since they are the &#8220;Promised People&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Islaam however, no worship is complete without the presence of all three qualities: LOVE of Allah, Hope in His Mercy and FEAR of His Punishment. Contemplate the opening Soorah of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; Sooratul Faatihah &#8211; and you will see for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Aaayah 1: &#8220;All Praise [and Thanks] are for Allah, Rabb of all the worlds.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this opening aayah (verse) of the Qur&#8217;aan, we have LOVE of Allah and every time we recite this aayah we are testifying to our love for Allah. How is that you ask? IT is because in this aayah, we are acknowledging that Allah is our Rabb and the Rabb of all the worlds. Rabb is usually translated as &#8216;the Lord&#8217;, but this translation does not do justification to this name of Allah and all the meanings that this name carries. In reality Rabb means that Allah is the Creator of everything; He sustains and nourishes everything; He gives life and death; anything good which we have is from Him; everything is dependent on Him and nothing can happen unless He wills it. Furthermore, for the Muslim He &#8211; the Rabb &#8211; is the One who has guided us to the Truth and given us good morals and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thuis when we testify that Allah is out Rabb, then we are acknowledging that He is the One who has given us so many blessings &#8211; so many that is we tried to enumerate His blessings upon us, we could not count them. So how could we not love Him? After all, we know that when someone gives us even a small gift or shows even a small act of kindness towards us, then we develop so much love for them on account of that &#8211; so imagine then the love we should[1] have for our Rabb who has given us everything: nice families, shelter, security, food, health, and above all, Guidance to Islaam and the Sunnah. We should be overwhelming in our love for Him and thank Him and say: &#8220;All Praises [and Thanks] are for Allah, Rabbil-&#8216;aalameen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 2: &#8220;The Rahman [Merciful] and the Raheem [Mercy-Giving].&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first aayah of Sooratul-Faatihah, Allah mentioned that He was ar-Rabb. In the next aayah two more of His beautiful names are mentioned: ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem. Ar-Rahman means that He is the Most Merciful, that is, His Nature or His Essence is Merciful. Ar-Raheem means that He is the Giver of Mercy, in other words, His actions are full of Mercy and He shows Mercy to His creation.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we mention these two names of Allah, then we have HOPE. Since He has described Himself as so full of Mercy then we have hope that He will forgive out sins, and no matter how numerous out sins may be, we should never lose this hope, because Allah has told us: &#8220;O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah verily Allah forgives all sins [except shirk]. Truly He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Mercy-Giving.&#8221; [az-Zumar (39):53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The need to have FEAR in our worship is shown by the next aayah of Sooratul-Faatihah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 3: &#8220;King/Master of the Day of Judegment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we recite this aayah we are reminding ourselves of the Day of Judgement &#8211; that awful Day, when we shall all stand before Allah, naked, uncircumcised and barefooted. Some will be sweating so much that it will go seventy arm-length into the earth. People will appear drunk though they are no. On this Day, every person will stand before Allah and account for his sins, knowing that not even the smallest action which he did is hidden from Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.&#8221; [az-Zalzalah (99):7-8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we recite this third aayah of Sooratul-Faatihah, we remind ourselves of this Judgement and accountability and that should bring about in us a sense of fear &#8211; that maybe out evil actions will be too great and we will be responsible for it &#8211; may Allah protect us from such a fate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the next verse goes on to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You alone we worship.&#8221; i.e. we single out Allah for our worship. And how do we worship Him? With LOVE, HOPE and FEAR. And in order to achieve these qualities, we need Allah&#8217;s assistance, so we say then: &#8220;We seek Your Aid.&#8221; [1:4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>STRIKING THE BALANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After understanding the need to have love, fear and hope in our worship, the question that now arises is: in what proportions should these qualities be present in our worship? Again we turn to the Qur&#8217;aan for our answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Call upon Him with Fear and Hope.&#8221; [al-A&#8217;raff(7):56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Their sides forsake their beds, to invokde their Lord in Fear and Hope.&#8221; [as-Sajdah(32):16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both fear and hope should be present inour hearts in equal proportions. Anas &#8211; radiAllaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; reported that the Prophet, sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam entered upon a young boy who was dying. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam asked: &#8220;How are you?&#8221; The boy replied: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am in-between hoping in Allah and fearing for my sins.&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;The like of these two qualities do not unite in the heart of a servant except that Allah gives him what he hopes for and protects him from what he feared.&#8221;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whenever we do a good action, we should have hope that it has been accepted by Allah, but at the same time we should also have fear that maybe it isn&#8217;t enough or that the good deed has not been worthy of acceptance. Likewise when we sin, we should have hope that Allah will accept out Repentance and forgive us, but we should also fear that we may be accountable for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This balance should also be reflected in out da&#8217;wah (which of course is also worship). So when we invite others to the Truth, we should not give them the impression that they have &#8220;nothing to worry about&#8221;; nor do we suggest that they are doomed forever. Rather, we couple warnings with encouragement. We inform them of the horrors of the Fire as well as telling them about the bliss of Paradise. Just as we find Allah telling us in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily your Lord is Quick in Punishment and verily He is Oft-Forgiving, the Giver of Mercy.&#8221; [al-A&#8217;raaf(7):167].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Righteous Predecessors used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;He who worships Allah with hope only is a Murji&#8217;ee. He who worships Him in fear only is a Harooree [Khaarijee]. And he who worships Allah in love only is a Zindeeq [e.g. Soofees, Christians]. But he who worships Allah in fear, love and hope is a Muwahhid Mu&#8217;min [a believer upon Tawheed.&#8221;</em> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Murji&#8217;ah were a sect that emerged within the first century of Islaam. The people of this sect (known as murji&#8217;ees) believe that sins do not affect faith, i.e. no matter what sins a person commits, his eemaan (faith) is complete and perfect. They worship Allah only with hope because they belive that as along as one believed and testified to Islaam, they would enter Paradise regardless of their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, all too often nowadays we find a somewhat similar attitude amongst the Muslims today, which is why we find that so often when we try to advise someone to turn to the Deen and abandon sin, they just point to their hearts and say, &#8220;Allah knows what&#8217;s in my heart&#8221;, or that &#8220;Allah forgives&#8221; or something similar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Khawaarij, they worshipped Allah in fear only because they held that anyone who committed major sins was a disbeliever and would therefore dwell in Hellfire forever. This, of course, is gross extremism and a straying from the correct Path. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;There were two men from Banoo Israa&#8217;eel who strove equally. One of them committed sins and the other strove hard in worship. And the one who strove in worship continued to see the other sin and kept saying to him: &#8216;Desist&#8217;. So one day, he found him committing a sin and so said to him: &#8216;Desist&#8217;. So he replied: &#8220;Leave me to my Lord; have you been sent as a watcher over me?&#8221; He said: &#8220;By Allah, Allah will nor forgive you, nor will Allah admit you to Paradise.&#8221; Then their sould were taken and they came together before the Lord of the Worlds. So He said to the one who strove in worship: &#8220;Did you have knowledge of Me, or did you have any power over what was in my Hands?&#8221; And He said to the sinner: &#8220;Go and enter Paradise through My Mercy.&#8221; And He said to the other: &#8220;Take him to the Fire.&#8221; Aboo Hurairah said: &#8220;By Him is Whose Hand is my soul! He spoke a word which destroyed this world and the Hereafter for him.&#8221;[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore we should never say of anyone that he or she is a &#8216;lost cause&#8217; or &#8216;doomed&#8217; or the like since this is a great sin. However, we fear for those who commit major sins because they have been threatened with punsihment in the Qur&#8217;aan. It is up to Allah whether He chooses to punish them or whether He will forgive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Zanaadiqah &#8211; or the heretics &#8211; are groups, such as many of the Soofees who have become like the Christians and reduced the religion to just &#8216;love&#8217; and so all their talk and all their mystical practices are centred around developing more &#8216;love&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear how imbalances in any of the three qualities of worship can lead to major deviation and straying from the True Guidance, Therefore it is important for every Muslim to inculcate all three things in his heart properly. As was mentioned before, the fear and hope should be in equal proportions[6] but as for love, then that should be uppermost, As Fudayl ibn Iyyaad (d.187H) said: &#8220;The love is better than fear. The fear checks us from sinning, and the love makes us to do what is prescribed with an open heart.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala grant us what we hope for and protect us from what we fear. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 This is why the Prophet, sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam encouraged us to give gifts to one another. He said: &#8220;Give gifts to one another, you will come to love one another.&#8221; [Hasan &#8211; Collected in al-Bukhaaree&#8217;s al-Adabul-Mufrad &amp; declared hasan by al-Albaanee in al-Irwaa(1601).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 As explained by Ibnul-Qayyim (d.751H) in Badaa&#8217;i-ul-Faawaa&#8217;id &amp; others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 Hasan &#8211; Collected by at-Tirmidhee &amp; Ibn Maajah. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in Ahkaamul-Janaa&#8217;iz (no. 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 Quoted by ibn Rajab in at-Takhweef minan-Naar as the saying of one of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 Saheeh &#8211; Reported by Aboo Hurairah &amp; collected in Aboo Daawood (eng. trans. vol.3 p.1365 no.4883). Authenticatd by al-Albaanee in Saheehul-Jaami (4455).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 This was the opinion of most of the Salaf. Al-Fudayl ibn &#8216;Iyyaad said that when one is healthy and well, then fear should predominate, but when terminally ill then hope should predominate &#8211; so that one should strive to do good when well and not despair of Allah&#8217;s Mercy when terminally ill. [At-Takhweef minan-Naar].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 Reported in at-Takhweef minan-Naar of Ibn Rajab. Note that some scholars hold that fear is better than love. Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Author:Shaykh ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Hasan aalush-Shaykh (d.1258H)<br />
Source:His commentary Fathul-Majeed li-Sharh Kitaabit-Tawheed (1/84-90)<br />
Translator:Al-Ibaanah Magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE MEANING OF WORSHIP:</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement of Allaah, the Most High: &#8220;I did not create the Jinn, nor mankind, except to worship Me.&#8221; [Sooratudh-Dhaariyaat 51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Worship (al-’Ibaadah) is obedience to Allaah by following that which He ordered upon the tongues of His Messengers.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;Worship (al-’Ibaadah) is a comprehensive term covering everything that Allaah loves and is pleased with &#8211; whether saying, or actions, outward and inward.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Qayyim (d.751H), rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Worship revolves around fifteen principles. Whosoever completes them has completed the stages of ’uboodiyyah (servitude to Allaah). The explanation of this is that ’ibaadah is divided between the heart, the tongue, and the limbs. And that for each one of these three come five types of rulings, covering all actions: waajib (obligatory), mustahabb (recommended), haraam (prohibited), makrooh (disliked), and mubaah (permissible).&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.671H), rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The root of ’ibaadah is humility and submissiveness. The various duties that have been prescribed upon the people are called ’ibaadaat (acts of worship), since what is required is that these acts of worship must be done with humility and submissiveness to Allaah, the Most High.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (d.774H), rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And ’ibaadah is obedience to Allaah by acting upon what He commands, and abandoning what He forbids; and this is the reality and essence of Islaam. And the meaning of Islaam is: istislaam (submission and surrender) to Allaah, the Most High, along with the utmost compliance, humility, and submissiveness to Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said whilst explaining the above aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed Allaah, the Most High, created the creation so that they could worship Him alone, without associating any partner with Him. Whoever obeys Him will be completely rewarded, whereas whoever disobeys Him would be punished with a severe punishment. And He has informed that He is neither dependant, nor does He have any need for them. Rather, it is they who are in dire need of Him, in every condition and circumstance, since He is the One who created, sustains, and provides for them.&#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE MEANING OF TAAGHOOT:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement of Allaah, the Most High: &#8220;And to every nation We sent Messengers, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him, and make their worship purely for Him; and that they should avoid at-Taaghoot.&#8221; [Sooratun-Nahl 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-taaghoot is from the word at-tughyaan, which means: going beyond the limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar Ibnul-Khattaab (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The taaghoot is Shaytaan.&#8221; [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The taaghoots are the soothsayers and fortune-tellers upon whom the devils descend.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.179H), rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Taaghoot: that which is worshipped besides Allaah.&#8221; [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what has been mentioned by certain people. However, Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim, rahimahullaahu, has given a very comprehensive definition, so he said, &#8220;The taaghoot is all that which causes the person to exceed the limits with regards to that which is worshipped, followed, or obeyed. So the taaghoot in any nation is whosoever turns to other than Allaah and His Messenger for matters of judgement; or is pleased to be worshipped besides Allaah; or is followed without a clear proof from Allaah; or is obeyed in that which is known to be disobedience to Allaah.&#8221; [9]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt, we all hate the slavery and subjugation that we see on the earth today; meaning the subjugation of some men over others, by which some enslave others; humiliating them, and trampling over them. This is indeed hated. However, the enslavement that we wish to talk about is different to this. It is as Rib&#8217;ee ibn &#8216;Aamir <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<b> &#8220;Allaah has sent us to deliver whomsoever chooses, from the<i> &#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (enslavement, worship and servitude) of men to the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah, And from the narrowness of this world, to the vastness of this world and the Hereafter. And from the tyranny and oppression of (false) religions, to the justice of Islaam.&#8221;</b> 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (enslavement, servitude and worship) mentioned here is the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah, which makes a person the noblest of all creatures upon the earth. One of the Salaf (Pious Predecessors) said in a couplet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;What has made me noble and precious;<br />
Is that You, O Allaah, have mode me enter into Your submission.<br />
And have made me one of the followers of;<br />
Your Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> &#8211; this submission, worship and enslavement is what Allaah refers to in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I have not created Jinn and Mankind, except that they should worship Me.&#8221;</b> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat 51:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Verse Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! Worship your Lord who has created you from a single person.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But how do we define this<i> &#8216;uboodiyyah</i>? This worship or <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> is: All that which Allaah loves and is pleased with, whether it is an action of the heart, the tongue or the limbs. We, however, will specifically discuss the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Enslavement of the Heart]</b><br />
Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has placed in everyone that He has created, a heart which must be filled; either with <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (worship, submission and enslavement) to Allaah, or <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to other than Allaah. Every single heart has feelings, desires and inclinations. The question is: will those feelings, desires and inclinations be directed to and for Allaah alone, or will they be directed to other than Allaah! Only the former counts as being the true <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of the heart to Allaah. The <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of the heart to things other than Allaah are many. Sometimes the heart is enslaved by, and worships money, sometimes it is enslaved by, and worships power and position, sometimes it is enslaved by, and worships women; or other similar things that people desire and covet so much. However, whatever they covet can either lessen their <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah, or completely nullify it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Being a Slave to Wealth]</b><br />
Someone may ask: What is the proof that some people become slaves to money, or other similar things, and worship it? The proof is in the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> where he said: <i>&#8220;Woe be to the&#8217;abd (slave and worshipper) of the dirham, woe be to the &#8216;abd of the deenaar (dirham ond deenaar: equivilant to the Pound and the pence) &#8230;&#8221;</i>3 Someone may ask: How does this enslavement to money manifest itself, and what is its nature! It is when the heart becomes so in love with money, that it covers up, or suppresses the love for Allaah, This love can reach such an extent that a person desires to attain this wealth by any means possible &#8211; neither caring whether the wealth comes to him through <i>halaal</i> (lawful) means; in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or means that are <i>haraam</i> (unlawful and forbidden) in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So understand by reflection, that every single heart in all created things has feelings, desires and inclinations. It has the desire to love, to gain good and beneficial things for itself, it can feel fear and terror, and it can also surrender and become submissive. Thus, when its feelings, desires and inclinations are all directed to and for Allaah, then it is a heart that truly worships, submits and surrenders to Allaah alone. Therefore, it has <i>khawf</i> (fear) of only Allaah; it has <i>rajaa</i> (hope) in Allaah&#8217;s Mercy; it has <i>mahabbah</i> (love) for Allaah and whatever Allaah loves; and it has <i>istislaam</i> (submits and surrenders) to only Allaah. However, when these feelings, desires and inclinations are directed to other than Allaah, then it is a heart that is enslaved and worships that object which has captured and enslaved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbiddance of the heart submitting to other than Allaah should not be misunderstood to mean that Muslims must forsake the world and dealing with it. Rather, the true position of a Muslim is that which was with the <i>Sahaabah</i> (Companions) <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i>. They held the wealth in their hands, yet none of it was in their hearts. [About this, Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;The position of wealth should be regarded like that of the toilet, in that there is need for it, but it has no place in the heart, and it is resorted to when needed.&#8221;4] The point being made is that we are not trying to call the people to the opinion of some of the <i>Soofees</i>, who believe that it is forbidden for a Muslim to possess wealth and take part in worldly transactions. Rather, it is obligatory for the Muslims to be the richest of people so that they may use this wealth as a means to worship Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; and to help people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of submitting and being enslaved to other than Allaah is when people submit and enslave their hearts to power and leadership. They are prepared for humiliation to take hold of them, and to abandon their scruples, in order to gain votes during elections; or other such similar situations. They are prepared to submit themselves to people &#8211; doing whatever is necessary for them to do &#8211; in order to win other people&#8217;s favour, and thus gain that vote or position. Thus, this is another form of submitting and enslaving one&#8217;s heart to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[The Greatness of Tawheed]</b><br />
As opposed to all this, the true and pure <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah; the true submission and enslavement of one&#8217;s heart to Allaah; is the same as when we say: <i>Tawheed</i> (to sincerely and purely single-out Allaah alone for worship). When the person has this degree of <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i>, he worships Allaah alone; fears Allaah alone; loves Allaah and for Allaah alone; and all his inclinations and desires are directed to Allaah. For this reason <i>Tawheed</i> is the greatest action that a person can perform, and the most beneficial action that a person can possess for himself on the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever witnesses that none has the right to be worshiped except Allaah, with ikhlaas (purely and sincerely) from his heart, will enter Paradise.&#8221;</i>5 The meaning of this is that the person who actualised Tawheed in his life, and does what this <i>Tawheed</i> requires of him. Likewise, based upon this, we understand that any act of worship, or any good action or nice manner ism &#8211; if it is not accompanied by this Tawheed &#8211; will not be accepted by Allaah on the Day of judgement, no matter how great and valuable that action apparently seems. And what shows you the greatness of this <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (submission and enslavement) and Tawheed (pure worship) of Allaah in the heart, is the following incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;There was a man who used to greatly sin. So when death approached him, he said to his sons: When I die, burn me and then crush my remains and then scatter the remains into the air. For by Allaah! If Allaah has power over me, then He will punish me in a manner that He has never punished anyone else. So when he died, then sons did what they were asked to do. So Allaah ordered the earth saying. Gather what you have of his remains. So it did. And behold, there he was standing. So Allaah asked him: What made you do what you did? The man said, Due to fear of You, 0 my Lord. So Allaah forgave him because of this.&#8221;</i>6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us the greatness of <i>khashyah</i> (fear), since this fear that he had was one of the meanings that are part of, and included in, the meaning of <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why all actions &#8211; even if they were to fill the heavens and the earth &#8211; will not be accepted by Allaah unless these actions have sprouted from a person having pure <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (submission, worship and servitude) to Allaah, worshipping Allaah alone, and not associating any partner along with Him in this worship (i.e. not committing Shirk). Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set-up with Him, but He forgives anything lesser than that to whomsoever He Wills. Whoever set-up partners with Allaah (commits Shirk) has indeed committed the most grievous sin.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And We came forth to what they brought from their actions and We made it scattered dust.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which shows us the greatness of Tawheed also, is this second incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a jewish boy who used to serve the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and had become ill. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> went to visit him and sat by his head and said: &#8220;Accept Islaam.&#8221; The boy looked at his father who was with him. So his father said to him: Obey Abul-Qaasim (i.e. the Prophet) <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So he accepted Islaam. As the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was leaving, he said: <i>&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who saved this boy from the Fire.&#8221;</i>7 Meaning, that although this person had no good deeds, yet because of him saying this statement of <i>Tawheed</i> &#8211; purely and sincerely from his heart &#8211; it was enough to save him from the Hellfire and cause him to enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>The Fruits of Tawheed]</b><br />
So as this <i>Tawheed</i> strengthens in the heart, becoming stronger, firmer and more well-rooted, then as a result, one&#8217;s deeds will likewise multiply and his worship of Allaah will</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">become greater and much more firmer. Since, if a person realises with <i>ikhlaas</i> (sincerity) and <i>yaqeen</i> (certainty) in his heart that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; is the One who has created him, then he knows that he should only worship Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections. Thus, as this realisation becomes firmer in the heart, then good deeds become more apparent and multiply in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So reflect upon Allaah&#8217;s great Wisdom in that when He created Hellfire, He created it with different levels and degrees. The highest level being the one having the least punishment and torment in it &#8211; which is for those people who had <i>Tawheed</i>, yet along with this, had many sins that they did not repent from. Thus, though they will be punished at this level, until they are purified from their sins, but because of this <i>Tawheed</i> and <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah alone in their hearts, they will eventually be saved from the Hellfire and admitted into Paradise. This level of Hellfire will then have no inhabitants left in it. This shows the greatness and virtue of <i>Tawheed</i> and the worship of Allaah alone, due to which they will eventually be rescued from the Hellfire, not being eternally condemned in it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah has sent us to deliver whomsoever chooses, from the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (enslavement, worship and servitude) of men to the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah; from the narrowness of this world, to the vastness of this world and the Hereafter; and from the tyranny and oppression of (false) religions, to the justice of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Laying the Foundations]</b><br />
What also shows the importance of <i>Tawheed</i>, is the life and example of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. It can be divided into two stages: The first stage is when he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was in Makkah. The second stage was in Madeenah. So in Makkaah his message was only to teach one thing; and that was the worship of Allaah alone without any partners; which is the matter of <i>Tawheed</i> or <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> to Allaah alone. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not call the people to leave any other sin, nor to do any other good deed. During this period he only called them to single out Allaah alone with worship, since this is the foundation upon which all else is built. Thus, we must understand that once a person&#8217;s heart is truly filled with the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> (love, humility, submission and enslavement) to Allaah alone, he will then begin to fulfill all the obligations which Allaah has placed upon him, to the best of his ability. This is borne out by the following statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhoo</i> said:<br />
&#8220;The first part (of the Qur&#8217;aan) to be revealed was a <i>Soorah</i> (chapter) from the <i>mufassal</i> (shorter chapters) in which Paradise and Hell were mentioned. Then, when the people entered into Islaam, came the revelation regarding the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and <i>haraam</i> (unlawful). Had the first revelation been: Do not drink <i>khamr</i> (wine and other intoxicants). They would have said: We shall never give up drinking <i>khamr</i>. Had the first revelation been: Do not commit <i>zinaa</i> (adultery and fornication), they would have said: We shall never give up committing <i>zinaa</i>.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the foundation, about which &#8211; if a person agrees he will then desire and agree to abandon all sins and acts of disobedience. Indeed, it was only after Tawheed, the worship of Allaah alone; and the willingness to submit and surrender to Allaah was understood by the Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; and it had settled in the depths of their hearts, that Allaah began to order them with the various commands and prohibitions. It was then that the command was revealed to establish <i>Salaah</i> (Prayer); pay the <i>Zakaah</i>; fast in the month of <i>Ramadaan</i>; then afterwards the command to make <i>Hajj</i> (Pilgrimage to Makkah); and so on, until all the commands which Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; wanted to order and prohibit the people with were given, step by step, one by one &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this call to the <i>&#8216;uboodiyyah</i> of Allaah and to single Him out alone for love, obedience and worship, is the common message of all the Prophets and Messengers <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>. Every single Prophet and Messenger came to his people saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O my people, worship Allaah alone, making all your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshiped by you.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the message of the Prophet Nooh, Ibraaheem, Moosaa, &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>; and the <i>khaatim</i> (final and last) of the Prophets, Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. They all came with this same message.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most beautiful this about the concept of worship in Islaam is the truly unique way in which it incorporates the feelings of <strong>love</strong>, <strong>fear</strong> and <strong>hope</strong> within the hearts of the worshippers of Allah. Understanding how to combine these three qualities into the worship (&#8216;ibaadah) of Allah is one of the most essential things that every Muslim must grasp</p>
<p>And our Righteous Predecessors used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;He who worships Allah with hope only is a Murji&#8217;ee. He who worships Him in fear only is a Harooree [Khaarijee]. And he who worships Allah in love only is a Zindeeq [e.g. Soofees, Christians]. But he who worships Allah in fear, love and hope is a Muwahhid Mu&#8217;min [a believer upon Tawheed].&#8221;</em> [4]</span></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The fear and hope should be in equal proportions[6] but as for love, then that should be uppermost, As Fudayl ibn Iyyaad (d.187H) said: &#8220;The love is better than fear. The fear checks us from sinning, and the love makes us to do what is prescribed with an open heart.&#8221;</span></em>[7]</p>
<p>(Read the below link for further understanding of the above statements)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Foot Notes</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[4] Quoted by ibn Rajab in at-Takhweef minan-Naar as the saying of one of the Salaf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[5] Saheeh &#8211; Reported by Aboo Hurairah &amp; collected in Aboo Daawood (eng. trans. vol.3 p.1365 no.4883). Authenticatd by al-Albaanee in Saheehul-Jaami (4455).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[6] This was the opinion of most of the Salaf. Al-Fudayl ibn &#8216;Iyyaad said that when one is healthy and well, then fear should predominate, but when terminally ill then hope should predominate &#8211; so that one should strive to do good when well and not despair of Allah&#8217;s Mercy when terminally ill. [At-Takhweef minan-Naar].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[7] Reported in at-Takhweef minan-Naar of Ibn Rajab. Note that some scholars hold that fear is better than love. Allah knows best.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this portion we finish the introduction with the narrations and statements of our Salafus-Saaleh regarding adhereing to that which the Companions were upon, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh explains how great evil and innovation can start as something small and then continues with explaining how Taqwa and righteous actions leads to happiness, tranquility, security and increase in provision.</p>

<blockquote><p>In this lesson we begin with the ayaat in Surat at-Talaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). (At-Talaq 65:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allâh, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allâh will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allâh has set a measure for all things. (At-Talaq 65:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;.and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him. (At-Talaq 65:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;. and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will remit his sins from him, and will enlarge his reward. (At-Talaq 65:5)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">So who from us does not want a way out from every difficulty?  Who does not want his or her affairs to become easy?  And who does not want his or her sins to be forgiven and reward enlarged?</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Listen to what the Sheikh has explained about these ayaat and more&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this part we study what the Sheikh said regarding how we understand the hadith of Ibn Abbaas that the Messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasallam, said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>احْفَظْ اللَّهَ يَحْفَظْكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Preserve Allah and He will Preserve You.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also the tremendous benefit in the statement of the Sheikh, &#8220;Get to know Allah in times of ease and He will know you in times of hardship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Listen for more gems like these&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this explanation of Aqeedah Tahawiyyah, brother Dawud Burbank explains the Point #5 ,#6 and #7 as outlined below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. And there is nothing worthy of worship except Him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Tawheed Al Uloohiyyah. Laa Ilaah means nothing worthy of worship except Him. But if you said, “Nothing is worshiped except Him”, then this is false, because there are many that are worshipped other than Allaah the Glorious and Majestic. So if you say that nothing is worshipped except Allaah, you have made everything that is worshipped into Allaah, and this is the Madh’hab of the people of Wahdatul Wajood, so if the one who says that believes in it, then he is from the people of Wahdatul Wajood, but if he does not believe in it, then he said blindly following someone, or because he heard it from someone, then this is incorrect, and it is obligatory upon him to correct that, and some people start their Salaah with this, “Nothing is worshipped except You.” And Allaah is the One Who has the right to be worshipped, and anything else other than Him that is worshipped, is worshipped upon falsehood. He the most High says, “That is because Allaah, He is the Truth, and what they invoke besides Him, it is falsehood, and verily, Allaah He is the Most High, the Most Great.” (Al Hajj 22:62)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. He is Qadeem (Eternal) with no beginning, and the Ever Lasting with no end.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the statement of Allaah proves this, “He is the First and the Last.“ (Al Hadid 57:3), along with the statement of His Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam, “You are the First, so there are none before You, and You are the Last, so there are none after You.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the word Qadeem (old) is not associated with Allaah, except informatively. It is not from His names; rather from His names is Al Awwal (The First), and Al Awwal is not like Al Qadeem, because Al Qadeem may have something before it, while Al Awwal has nothing preceding it. He sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said, “You are Al Awwal, so there are none before You.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the author was cautious, so he said, “ He is Qadeem with no beginning.” But if he would have said, “Qadeem” and stopped, then the meaning of this would be incorrect.</p>
<p>Footnotes: [4] Narrated by Imaam Muslim hadeeth number 2713</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. He will not perish, nor will He pass away.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perishing and passing away hold the same meaning. Allaah has been characterized with an everlasting life; He the most High says, “And put your trust in the Ever Living One Who dies not, and glorify His Praises, and Sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His slaves.” (Al Furqaan 25:58). So extinction does not come to Allaah, and He the Glorious and Most High says, “Everything will perish save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you shall be returned.” (Al Qasas 28:88). And He the most High says, “Whatsoever is on it will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor will abide forever.” (Ar Rahman 55:26-27). So eternity is for Allaah, and the creation will die and then be summoned, and they used to be non existent in the beginning, and then Allaah created them, and then they will die, and then Allaah the Glorious and Majestic will summon them. So Allaah the most High has no beginning, nor an end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[21]</strong> They performed worship by whistling and clapping their hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>&#8211; the explanation &#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the aspects of the Days of Ignorance that the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) opposed them in was their performance of worship to Allaah by means of whistling and clapping. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا كَانَ صَلاَتُهُمْ عِندَ الْبَيْتِ إِلاَّ مُكَاء وَتَصْدِيَةً فَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And their prayer at the House (Ka&#8217;bah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. So taste the torment because of what you used to disbelieve.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Anfaal:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: The worship that the polytheists performed to Allaah at the sacred Ka&#8217;bah was nothing more than whistling and clapping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <em>mukaa</em> means whistling, while <em>tasdeeyah</em> means clapping with the hands and palms. They would do this while at the House of Allaah and call it prayer, seeking nearness to Allaah through it. This is one of the things the devils among mankind and the jinn beautified to them, in order to deceive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Worship is not to be done except according to what Allaah has legislated &#8211; so it is dependent upon revelation. A person must not introduce something from his own self or take it from someone else when it is not according to what Allaah has legislated, thus worshipping Allaah by it even though it has no source in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, we can derive the prohibition of these two matters, which are: whistling and clapping. They are forbidden even though one may not intend to be performing worship by them, since there can be found imitation of the polytheists in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for clapping, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) only allowed it specifically<sup>1</sup> for women at the time of a necessity, such as to notify the Imaam if he has omitted or added something to the prayer. This was due to the fitnah that could occur from their voice if there are men present. And it is not permissible for a man to imitate the disbelievers or to imitate a women by clapping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا كَانَ صَلاَتُهُمْ عِندَ الْبَيْتِ إِلاَّ مُكَاء وَتَصْدِيَةً فَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ<strong>1</strong> Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه‏) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;<strong>Saying Subhaanallaaah is for men and clapping is for women.&#8221;</strong> [Transmitted by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 1203) and Muslim (no. 422/106)] And in the hadeeth of Sahl bin Sa&#8217;ad, he reported that the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: <strong>&#8220;Why is it that I see you clapping so much. Whoever is doubtful about something is the prayer, let him SubhanAllaah for if one says it, it will attract attention. Clapping is only for women.</strong>&#8221; Transmitted by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 684) and Muslim (no. 421)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From the book Masaa&#8217;il-ul-Jaahiliyyah (Aspects of the Days of Ignorance) by Shaykh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab (d.1206h) explained by Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Women are ‘Awrah &#8211; Explained</strong></p>
<p>‘Abdullâh b. Mas’ûd – Allâh be pleased with him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women are but an ‘awrah (something private to be covered). A woman might leave her house without there being any problem with her, but the Shaytân seeks her out and says [to her], “You will not pass by anyone except that you will impress/please him.” A woman puts on her clothes and is asked where she is going, to which she replies, “To visit a sick person,” or “to attend a funeral”, or “to pray in the masjid”; <span style="color:#0000ff;">but a woman never worships Allâh in the way she does when she worships Him in her house</span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#888888;">by Imam Ibn ul Qayyim Jawziyyah,</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;">[Madarij as-Saalikeen 1/100-101, 105], Slightly adapted by Dr Saleh as-Saleh</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;">From a footnote in &#8220;The Dispraise of Al-Hawaa (Desire) by Ibnul Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah&#8221; © 1998 Dar al-Bukhaari</span></p>
<blockquote><p>`Uboodiyyah is a comprehensive term that asserts the meaning of the Verse (Aayah).<br />
&#8220;You Alone do we worship and You Alone do we seek for Help.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 1:5)</p></blockquote>
<p>It comprises the slavery of the heart, tongue and limbs to Allaah ta`aala.</p>
<p>The slavery of the heart includes both the Qawl (saying of the heart) and `Amaal (actions of the heart).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Qawl of the heart</strong> is the belief (I`tiqaad) in what Allaah has informed about His Self, His Names and Attributes, His Action, His Angels, and that which He revealed in His Book and sent upon the tongue of His Messenger Muhammad sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The `Amaal of the heart</strong> include love for Allaah, reliance upon Him, turning to Him in repentance, fearing Him, having hope in Him, devoting the Deen sincerely to Him, having patience in what He orders and forbids, having patience with His decrees and being pleased with them, having allegiance for His pleasure, having humility for Him and humbling oneself in front of Him, and becoming tranquil with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Qawl (saying) of the tongue</strong> is to convey what Allah has revealed (in the Qur&#8217;an and authentic Sunnah) regarding Himself, His Names and Attributes, His Actions, His Commands, His Prohibitions, and all that is related to this Deen), to call to it, defend it, to expose the false innovations which oppose it, and to establish its remembrance and to convey what it orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The `Amaal (actions) of the limbs</strong> include the Salaat (prayers), Jihaad, attending  the Jumu`ah prayers and the rest of the Jamaa`aat (congregational prayers), assisting those who are unable, and acting with goodness and kindness to creation, and other such acts.</p>
<p>This comprehensive meaning of the <strong>`Uboodiyyah pertains to its specific type</strong>. The people who fall under this type of `Uboodiyyah are the believers who obey, love, and sincerely follow the Deen of Allaah ta`aala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>second type of `Uboodiyyah is the general one</strong> in which all creatures in the heavens and in the earth are subdued to Allaah&#8217;s sovereign Authority and Power; everything is subservient to His Will, and Authority; nothing occurs or ceases to occur except by His leave; His is the Kingdom and He disposes the affairs as He pleases. This type of `Uboodiyyah is known as the `<span style="color:#993300;">Uboodiyyah of Qahr (Subduing) and Mulk</span> (Sovereignty, Kingship, Possession, Mastership, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the part of the Aayah signifying &#8220;You do we worship&#8221; asserts the adherence to the four principles of `Uboodiyyah:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sayings of the heart The actions of the heart,</li>
<li>The sayings of the tongue, and</li>
<li>The actions of the limbs.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other part, &#8220;You Alone do we seek for Help,&#8221; stresses the fact that the believer must ask Allaah alone to help him establish the `Uboodiyyah and succeed in executing all what it requires.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Precious Gem: The Reward of Being Busy in the Service of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the servant of Allah begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except Allah, the Almighty, He will fulfill all his needs and relieve all his worries. He will empty the servant&#8217;s heart for the sake of His Love, his tongue will constantly remember Him and he will have the strength to perform religious duties for His sake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except the life of this world, Allah, the Almighty will cast worry and grief into his heart. He, the Almighty will leave him to himself, and keep his heart busy with things other than His Love. His tongue will not remember Allah but will only be concerned with the creation. He will use all his strength in things other than the sake of Allah, and he will remain busy in the service of creation. He will work very hard in the service of others. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Just like a bellows that pumps itself up and then squeezes itself to the utmost in the service of others. Therefore, whoever refuses to submit to Allah, to obey and love Him, will be afflicted with the servitude, love and service of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says in the Qur&#8217;an which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) (i.e. this Qur&#8217;an and worship of Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil) to be a Qarin (an intimate companion) to him&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Az-Zukhruf, 43:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyaynah said, &#8220;You will never bring forward any famous proverb but I will bring the likeness of it from the Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; Thereupon someone said to him, &#8220;So where is in the Qur&#8217;an<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Give your fellow brother a date, and if he does not accept it then give him a firebrand.&#8221;</strong></span> He then recited the previous Qur&#8217;anic verse.</p>

<p>[Read <a title="A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious) Scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his Knowledge" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com//2010/03/24/a-precious-and-valuable-gem-the-religious-scholar-whose-deeds-are-inconsistent-with-his-knowledge/">A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious) Scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his Knowledge</a> – Imam Ibn al Qayyim ]</p>
<p>We have previously mentioned the case of the religious scholar who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter. However, the mistake of the ignorant worshipper is rejecting knowledge, its verdicts, and his adherence to imagination and vain desires.</p>
<p>Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyainah and others said,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Beware of the trial of the immoral (religious) scholar and that of the ignorant worshipper, for both are apparent trials. The latter avoids knowledge out of ignorance, and the former calls for wrong doings out of immorality&#8221;.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, sets the example of the ignorant worshiper in the Qur&#8217;anic verse by saying,which means,</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Their allies deceived them) like Shai!an (Satan), when he says to man: &#8220;Disbelieve in Allah.&#8221; But when (man) disbelieves in Allah, Shaitan (Satan) says: &#8220;I am free of you, I fear Allah, the Lord of the &#8216;Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists)! So the end of both will be that they will be in the Fire, abiding therein. Such is the recompense of the ZalimOn (i.e. polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers in Allah and in His Oneness, etc.).&#8221;</span> (AI-Hashr, 59:16-17)</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">His story is well known, for he has based his life on worshipping Allah unknowingly, so Satan seized the opportunity and seduced him causing his disbelief. So, this is the end of every ignorant worshipper who unconsciously disbelieves, and the other one is the final end of every immoral scholar who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi </strong>(may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the religion of al-Islaam can be summarized into two basic important and mighty principles, and they are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First (al-Awwal):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship anyone except Allaah alone, having no partner in that<br />
[An-laa Na’budu illa-Allaah Wahdahu laa Shareeka lah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam): &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah.&#8221; Then, if they turn away, say: &#8220;Bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; (Aali Imraan 3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. (Al-Israa’ 17:23)<br />
And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) [Ash-hadu an-laa Ilaaha illa-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And The Second (ath-Thaanee):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship Him except by what He legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), without innovations and desires [An-laa Na’budahu illaa bimaa Shara’ fee Kitaabihi aw fee Sunnati Rasoolihi Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) laa bil-Bida’i wal-Ahwaa’].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
[Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) to these idolaters (pagan ‘Arabs) of your folk:] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliyaa&#8217; (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allaah), besides Him (Allaah). Little do you remember! (Al-A&#8217;raaf 7:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment. (Al-Hashr 59:7) And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah) [Ash-hadu anna Muhammadar-Rasool-ullaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in his valuable book ((Iqtidaa’ as- Siraatul-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifat Ashaab al-Jaheem)) [The Requirements of the Straight Path in Opposing the Companions of the Fire] page 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( And these two fundamentals: are the essence of the religion (Jimaa’ ad-Deen): That we do not worship anyone except Allaah and that we do not worship Him except with what He has legislated, and we do not worship Him with innovations … and these two fundamentals, they are the realization and the perfection of the two testimonies (ash-Shahaadatayn), which are the head of al- Islaam … ). End of quote. And see at-Tahqeeq wal-‘Eedaah of ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) page: 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the first fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, the Shaykh mentioned that in the Kitaab of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger we find many Aayaat and Ahaadeeth that point to this great fundamental principle. And it was for this cause that Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) sent His Messengers, and He ordered them to call the people first and foremost to this fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, and the oneness of Allaah in His worship (Tawheed al-Ulooheeyah), and the oneness of Allaah in His Names and Attributes (Tawheed al- Asmaa was-Sifaat), and the oneness of Allaah in His Lordship (Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah).&#8221; (An-Nahl 16:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) but We inspired him (saying): Laa Ilaaha Illaa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221; (Al-Anbiyaa’ 21:25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person worships Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) and obeys these commands of Allaah, then this is the realization of Tawheed, and this is the first fundamental which this religion of al-Islaam is based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the second fundamental principle, and it is that we do not worship Allaah except by what He has legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), and that we do not worship Him with innovations and desires. The Shaykh mentioned that those who beautify and make beautiful to themselves innovations and desires, and from the innovations is celebrating the Mawlid (birthday) of the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), which is an innovation of the Soofiyyah, and the Shaykh mentioned that this is not allowable in our religion and it is not legislated, and the people who perform this, they are under a severe threat. Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has issued a severe warning against those who oppose and go against the commandments of the Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. (An-Noor 24:63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been ordered to be followers and we have been ordered to take firm hold of the Sunnah. So that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has given us, then it is upon to take it and firmly hold on to it, and that which he prohibited us from then it is upon us to prohibit ourselves from it. And the one who goes against the clear orders of the Messenger (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is in opposition to the Messenger, and he is on a great level of jeopardy, and if Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) does not give him the Tawfeeq to repent, and he dies upon this, then he is in a dangerous state. And many of the people in this day and age have fallen into numerous types of innovations, such as the Soofiyyah and the Raafidhah, and other than them. And they have not prohibited themselves from that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has prohibited them from, and they have not enjoined upon themselves that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has enjoined upon them and ordered them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the valuable book of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah is the warning to the Believers of following the path of the people whose destination is the Fire, the people of the Book, the Jews and the Christians. And in this day and age we find many of the Muslims following the Kuffaar in all levels of life. And verily we have been ordered to oppose the Kuffaar in all actions and in all levels of life, such as our speech, and our character, and in our dress, and in our actions of worship, so much so that even in the prayer, as the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has said: ((Pray in your shoes, for verily the Jews do not pray in their shoes)). A Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many of the Muslims have invented various holidays following in the footsteps of the Kuffaar, such as labor day, and workers holiday, and mothers day, and other holidays like this, all of which are alien to al-Islaam and all of which are innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for hope and longing (ar-rajaa) is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>“So whoever hopes to see His Lord and be rewarded by Him, then let him perform righteous deeds and make it purely and sincerely for Him; and let him not make any share of it to anyone other than his Lord.”</em> </span>[Al-Kahf 18:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The evidence for hope and longing (ar-rajaa)” &#8211;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Hope and longing is one of the pillars that worship is built upon;</li>
<li>this means that a person is optimistic about obtaining the Mercy and Pardon of Allaah.</li>
<li>It is obligatory upon the servant that they combine both hope and fear because hope causes a person to long for the Mercy of Allaah and fear prevents them from perpetrating an act that earns the anger of Allaah.</li>
<li>Some of the people of knowledge have said that fear and hope are like the ‘two wings of the servant’.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Ar-rajaa is that a person wishes for something that may be attained and is close or it may be something far off but is treated as being close.</li>
<li>This earnest hope which comprises humility and submission may only be directed to Allaah and directing it to other than this is shirk; whether minor or major depends on state of the heart of the person in this case.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“is the saying of Allaah, the Most High: “So whoever hopes to see His Lord and be rewarded by Him, then let him perform righteous deeds and make it purely and sincerely for Him;”</span> </strong>&#8211; Meaning,</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>whoever desires and longs to meet their Lord, then sheer desire is not enough but he should also perform righteous deeds.</li>
<li>This verse is a proof that it is obligatory to perform righteous deeds.</li>
<li>A righteous deed is everything that brings the servant closer to Allaah, whether it is an obligation or a recommended act.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>A person who hopes but does not act is delusional and has false hopes; this is blameworthy.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“and let him not make any share of it to anyone other than his Lord.””</strong> </span>&#8211; Meaning,</p>
<ul>
<li>he should not commit major shirk that expels him from the religion or minor shirk that negates the completeness of tawheed.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Permissibility</strong></p>
<p>Source : Islamic Principles #1: The Principle of Permissibility , Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The principle regarding acts of worship is one of prohibition, except if the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Law) relates a prescription for it. And the principle regarding customary behaviour is permissibility, except when the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> relates a prohibition for it.&#8221; (<em><strong>Al-aslu fil-&#8216;ibaadat al-hadhru illaa ma waradah &#8216;anish-shar&#8217;ee tashree&#8217;ahu. Wal-aslu fil-&#8216;aadaat al-ibaahah illaa ma waradah &#8216;anish-shar&#8217;ee tahreemahu</strong></em>).1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above principle is an important principle that Islaam teaches. Thus, with regards to matters of <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> (day-to-day actions), such as eating, drinking and wearing clothes, then everything is allowed in this regard, except if there is a clear and authentic evidence restricting or prohibiting its allowance. However, when it comes to <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship), then the opposite is the true. Here, nothing can be established as an act of worship, except if there is a clear and authentic text to allow it. So the basic principle for <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> is <em>ibaahah</em> (permissibility), whereas the basic principle for <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> is <em>tahreem</em> (prohibition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H)- <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Peoples&#8217; sayings and actions are of two kinds: <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship) by which their Religion is established, and <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> (customary practices) which are required for day-to-day living. From the principles of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islaamic Law) we know that acts of worship are those acts which have been prescribed by Allaah or approved by Him; nothing is to be affirmed here, except through the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>. However, as far as worldly activities of people are concerned, they are necessary for everyday life. Here the principle is freedom of action; nothing may be restricted in this regard except what Allaah &#8211; the Mort Perfect &#8211; has restricted. This is the case because commanding and prohibiting are both in Allaah&#8217;s Hands. As far as worship is concerned, there has to be a command from Him concerning it. Thus, when it requires a command from Allaah to establish something, how can we say that something is restricted without His command? This is why Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) and other jurists who base their judgements upon <em>ahaadeeth</em> (Prophetic narrations) say: In relation to acts of worship, then the principle is tawqeef (limitation); that is to lay, nothing can be legislated in this regard except what Allaah legislates. To do otherwise is to incur the risk of being included in the meaning of the <em>Aayah</em> (verse):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them in the Religion that for which Allaah has not given any permission.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, as far as living habits are concerned, the principle here is freedom, because nothing can be restricted in this regard except what Allaah has prohibited. To do otherwise is to be included in the meaning of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Do you see what Allaah has sent down to you for sustenance? Yet you have made some part of it <em>halaal</em> (lawful) and some part <em>haraam</em> (prohibited).&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Yoonus 10:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great and beneficial principle, on the basis of which we can say that buying, selling, leasing, giving gifts, and other such matters are necessary activities for people, as are eating, drinking and the wearing of clothes. Thus, if the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islaamic Law) says something about these day-to-day matters, it is in order to teach good behaviour. Accordingly, it has prohibited whatever leads to corruption, has made obligatory that which is essential, has disapproved of that which is superfluous, and has approved of that which is beneficial. All this has been done with due consideration of the magnitude and properties of the various types of activities involved. Since this is the position of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, people are free to buy, sell and to lease just as they wish, just as they are free to eat and drink what they like &#8211; as long as it is not <em>haraam</em> (unlawful). Even though some of these things may be disapproved, they are still free in this regard, since the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> does not go to the extent of prohibiting them &#8211; and thus the original principle (of permissibility) remains.&#8221;2</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî reports that ‘Umar – Allâh be pleased with him – came to the Black Stone (performing tawâf, circumambulation), kissed it, and said, “I know that you are a stone, you do not cause benefit or harm; and if it were not that I had seen Allâh’s Messenger – peace and blessings of Allâh be upon him – kiss you, I would never have kissed you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Sahîh, </em>Chapter on what has been said about the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· The illustrious Companion and Caliph ‘Umar reminded us in this narration of the pure belief that benefit and harm are not caused by created objects and thus should not be sought from them. Only Allâh has control over these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We are reminded that acts of worship are taken from Allâh’s Messenger, and a person is not supposed to make up his own way of worship, he must follow the manner of worship that the Prophet taught and practiced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We also learn that once an action is confirmed in the Sunnah, the believer submits and complies and practices it because it is confirmed that Allâh’s Messenger did it, even if we don’t know the wisdom behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· This narration is also an example of how a responsible person tries to clarify and do away with any misunderstandings that people may have about matters of faith. The people had recently left their unbelief and polytheism, so ‘Umar wanted to make it clear that kissing the Black Stone is by no means done as an act of devotion to it, as people used to do with their stone idols.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : </strong>Transcribed from: Fatawa Arkan-ul-Islam | Islamic Verdicts on the pillars of Islam | Volume 1: Creed and Prayer |</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A.</strong> The middle course in religious matters means that a person should not be excessive, exceeding the limits set by Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, nor be deficient, by not fulfilling what Allah, the Most Glorified, the Most High has ordained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The middle course in religious matters is to hold fast to the way of the Prophet <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam, </em>while excess in religious matters is to exceed it, and deficiency is not to attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is that a man says: I want to stand for the night prayer and I will not sleep any of the time, because prayer is one of the best forms of worship, so I love to spend all the night in prayer. We say: This is excess in the religion of Allah, and it is not right, for something like this happened during the life of the Prophet <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam: </em>A number of people met and one of them said: I stand in prayer and I do not sleep, while another said: I fast and I do not break my fast, while a third said: I do not marry women. The Prophet <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam </em>was informed of this and he <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“What is wrong with people who say such and such? I fast and I break my fast, I stand in prayer and I sleep and I marry women, so whoever dislikes my Sunnah is not from me.” </em> [Bukhari, 6101; Muslim, 1401]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, these people intended to act excessively in the religion, and the Messenger <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam </em>declared that he was innocent of them, because they expressed excessiveness in his <em>Sunnah </em>which includes fasting, breaking the fast, standing in prayer, sleeping, and marrying women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is deficient, he is the one who says: There is no need for me to perform supererogatory acts of worship, so I shall not do so, but will perform the obligatory acts only. He might also be deficient in the obligatory acts. This is the one who is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moderate person is the one who acts in accordance with what the Messenger <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam </em>and the rightly guided caliphs followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example would be that of three men before whom is a sinful man, and one of them says: I will not give salutations of peace to this sinner and I will cut him off and stay away from him and not speak to him. The second one says: I will keep company with this sinner and give salutations of peace to him and smile at him and invite him to my house and accept his invitation, and in my opinion he is not but a righteous man. The third one says: I hate this sinner for his sins and love him for his faith and I will not cut him off except when cutting him off is a means of improving him, but if cutting him off does not result in improving him, instead causing him to increase his sinfulness, then I will not cut him off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say that the first person is excessive and extreme, while the second is excessively lacking and the third is moderate. This is what we say in all of the acts of worship and in conduct, the people are either deficient or extreme or moderate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third example is of a man who is a slave to his wife, she speaks to her husband in any way she wishes and he does not prevent her from doing evil, nor does he encourage her to strive for virtue. She possesses his mind and she becomes master over him. Another man is oppressive and arrogant, and deems himself superior to his wife and he pays no heed to her, and she is even less than a servant in his estimation. A third man is moderate and he treats her as Allah and His Messenger <em>salAllahu alayhi wa sallam </em>have commanded him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable</strong> (<em>Al Baqarah</em> 2:228)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“A believing man should not hate a believing woman. If there is some characteristic in her that he dislikes, there remains some other characteristic in her which pleases him.”</em> [Muslim, 1469]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This last one is moderate while the first is extreme in his treatment of his wife and the other is deficient. And you should base all deeds and acts of worship upon this example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.3</strong><br />
Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“(The Âyah): <strong>“You alone do we worship.”</strong> [Sûrah al-Fâtihah 1:5] is built upon four principles:- Ascertaining what Allâh and His Messenger love and are pleased with, from [i] the sayings of the heart and [ii] of the tongue; and [iii] the actions of the heart and [iv] of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-’ubûdiyyah (servitude and slavery to Allâh) is a comprehensive term for all these for stages. The one who actualises them has indeed actualised: <strong>“You alone do we worship.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The saying of the heart</strong>: It is i’tiqâd (belief) in what Allâh &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; informed about His Self; concerning His Names, His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels, and all that He sent upon the tongue of His Messenger sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The saying of the tongue</strong>: It is to inform and convey (what Allâh has revealed), to call to it, defend it, to explain the false innovations which oppose it, to establish its remembrance and to convey what it orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The action of the heart</strong>: Such as love for Him, reliance upon Him, repenting to Him, having fear and hope in Him, making the Dîn purely and sincerely for Him, having patience in what He orders and prohibits, having patience with what He decrees and being pleased with it, having allegiance and enmity for His sake, humbling oneself in front of Him and having humility in front of Him, becoming tranquil with Him and other than this from the actions of the heart which are actually connected to the action of the limbs &#8230; and actions of the limbs without the action of the heart is of little benefit, if any benefit at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The action of the limbs</strong>: Such as Prayer and Jihâd, attending the Jumu’ah and being with the Jamâ’ah, aiding those who are unable and displaying goodness and kindness to the creation, and other than this.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Madârijus-Sâlikîn (1/100-101)]</p>
<p><strong>About the Shaykh :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">He is Abû ’Abdullâh, Shamsud-Dîn Muhammad ibn Abû Bakr better known as Ibn al-Qayyim (or Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah). He was born in the year 691H in the city of Damascus. From an early age he set about acquiring knowledge and studied under many prominent teachers, the most notable of whom was Shaykhul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah. His students include the likes of Ibn Kathîr, adh-Dhahabî, Ibn Bajab, Ibn ’Abdul-Hâdî and others. He authored over ninety books and booklets &#8211; all of them being characterised by their touching address to the soul and the heart, as well as their accuracy, precision and depth of research. Ibn al-Qayyim died on the night of Thursday 13th Rajab at the time of the ’Ishâ <i>adhân</i> in the year 751H. Testaments about his comprehensive knowledge, firm adherence to the way of the <i>Salaf</i>; excellent manners, worship and <i>zuhd</i> have been given by Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajar in ad-<i>Dururul-Kâminah</i>(3/400), Al-Hâfidh Ibn Rajab in <i>Dhayl Tabaqâtul-Hanâbilah</i> (2/447), ash-Shawkânî in <i>al-Badrut-Tâli’</i> (2/143-146) and also Al-Hâfidh Ibn Kathîr who said about him in <i>al-Bidâyah wan-Nihâyah</i> (14/246): “He attained great proficiency in many branches of knowledge, particularly knowledge of <i>Tafsîr</i>, Hadîth and <i>Usûl</i>. When Shaykh Taqiyyud-Dîn Ibn Taymiyyah returned from Egypt in the year 712H, he stayed with the Shaykh until he died, learning a great deal of knowledge from him; along with the knowledge which he had already occupied himself in obtaining. So he became a singular Scholar in many branches of knowledge. He also continued to seek knowledge greatly day and night and was constant in humbly calling upon his Lord. He recited well and had fine manners. He had a great deal of love and did not harbour any envy for anyone, nor harm anyone, nor seek to find fault with anyone, nor bear any malice towards anyone. I was one of those who most often kept company with him and I was one of the most beloved of people to him. I do not know anyone in the world, in this time, who is a greater worshipper than him. His <i>Salâh</i> (Prayer) used to be very lengthy, with prolonged <i>rukû’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujûd</i> (prostration). His companions would often reproach him for this, yet he never retorted back, nor did he abandon this practice &#8211; may Allâh shower His Mercy upon him.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Abû Hurayrah – Allâh be pleased with him – that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I not point you to comfortable proceeds? </span></strong><br />
<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">People responded, “And what is that o Abû Hurayrah?” </span></strong><br />
<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">He replied, “Fasting in winter.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs used to refer to matters which were relatively easy to gain as being <em>cool</em>. In this narration, the relative ease of fasting in winter and its consequent reward is likened to acquiring war proceeds without the heat of violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from ‘Umar – Allâh be pleased with him – that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Winter is booty for the devout worshippers.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is further explained in the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from ‘Ubayd b. ‘Umayr – Allâh have mercy on him – that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It used to be said when winter came: O people of the Qur`ân, the night has become long so you can pray (more) and the day has become short for you to fast.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Nu’aym, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ilyah Al-Awliyâ`</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As with other experiences in this world, the Salaf used to be reminded of the hereafter when experiencing cold weather:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from the famous worshipper Râbi’ah – Allâh have mercy on her – that she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have never heard the adhân except that I remember the caller who will announce the Day of Resurrection, and I never see the falling snow except that I imagine the flying pages of the records of peoples deeds (on that day), and I never see swarms of locusts except that I think about the Great Gathering on the Last Day.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Jawzî, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>ifah Al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>afwah</em> Vol. 2 p433.</p>
