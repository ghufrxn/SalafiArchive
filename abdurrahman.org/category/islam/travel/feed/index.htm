<strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is the requirement for offering the fixed Sunnah prayers removed during travel, and (if so) what is the evidence for this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for one to leave the fixed Sunnah prayers during travel, except <em>Witr</em> and the Sunnah of <em>Fajr</em>. It has been authentically reported from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) in the Hadith of Ibn Umar and others, that the Prophet would not pray the fixed Sunnah prayers while travelling, except <em>Witr</em> and the Sunnah of <em>Fajr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the supererogatory prayer, they are prescribed during travel and while one is resident, and likewise the prayers for whose performance there is a reason, such as the Sunnah of <em>Wudhu</em>, <em>Tawaf</em>, <em>Adh-Dhuha</em>, and <em>Tahajjud</em> prayer at night, based upon <em>Hadiths</em> which have been narrated to that effect. And Allaah is the Granter of success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 29 : Point 36</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;And as for Fasting whilst upon a journey, then whoever wishes may Fast and whoever wishes may withhold from Fasting.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370743200&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/breaking-the-fast-during-the-journey-is-from-the-concessions-of-the-shariah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]Â </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>rukhas</em> (concessions/allowances) that Allaah has made for his servants is to withhold from Fasting in Ramadaan when upon a journey. So it is a <em>rukhsah</em> (concession). So whoever wishes, he can <em>aftara</em> (withhold) from Fasting and whoever wishes he can Fast. And if he Fasts whilst upon a journey then his Fasting will be correct because a Companion asked the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saying that he had strength and he was able to Fast upon a journey so he asked the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave him permission to Fast upon the journey. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a concession, so an allowance has been made, it is not obligatory to do it, rather it is better to do it just like the rest of the concessions. And if the person returns to the original situation (the <em>aslÂ </em>) and Fasts then there is no harm upon that. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever amongst you witnesses the beginning of the month (month of Ramadaan), whilst he is resident then let him Fast it and whomever is sick or upon a journey, let him Fast other days</strong></span>. (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to break his Fast upon his journeys. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim (no. 1121) from Hamzah ibn `Amr al-Aslamiyy radiyAllaahu `anh that he said, <strong>âOh Messenger of Allah, I find that I have strength to Fast upon the journey so would there be any sin upon me?â</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaahâs Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">âIt is a concession from Allaah so whoever takes it up then this is fine and whoever wishes to Fast then there is no sin upon him.â</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy, correct reference is (no. 1944) and Muslim (no. 1113) from Ibn `Abbaas <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> that Allaahâs Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> went out to go to Makkah in Ramadaan. So he Fasted until he reached Al-Kadeed then he broke his Fast; and the people stopped Fasting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translatorâs side point:</strong> This was in the eighth year; it was the journey for the Conquest of Makkah. AlKadeed is a place around two riding stages from Makkah, a place around fifty-five miles from Makkah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 29 : Point 35</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;And shortening the prayer whilst upon a journey is Sunnah.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370729907&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/shortening-the-prayer-whilst-upon-a-journey-is-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]Â </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>rukhas</em> (concessions/allowances), which the legislation came with to make things easier for the servants and to remove difficulty, is shortening the prayer whilst upon a journey and it is shortening the four <em>rak`ah</em> prayer and this is by the text of the Qur&#8217;aan, He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you travel upon the earth â¦</strong></span><br />
(Sooratun-NisaaÂ· (4), aayah 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning <em>saafartum</em>; when you go on a journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>â¦ then there is no sin upon you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve may put you to trial.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa (4), aayah 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent from the aayah is then it is not permissible to shorten the prayer except in a state of fear. However, this problem has been removed because Allaahâs Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>âWhy is it that we still shorten, now that we have become secure?â</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>âThat is a charity which Allaah has given to you so accept from Allaah His charity.â</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to shorten the prayer <strong>on all of his journeys;</strong> he would shorten the four <em>rak`ahs</em> prayer to two <em>rak`ahs</em>. This is the Sunnah, and whoever completes it then that is permissible, however it is in opposition to that which is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So shortening (<em>al-qasr</em>) is a concession, whoever wishes he can do it and that is better, whoever wishes, he can leave it and complete it, then there is no harm in that because completing (four rak&#8217;ahs) is the <em>asl</em>. And the author mentioned that because <span style="color:#ff0000;">accepting the concessions of the legislation is from matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> and that contains a refutation of those who are <em><strong>mutashaddideen</strong> </em>(over harsh); those who do not accept the legislated concessions</span>.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcription of the Audio Clip:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Another point of benefit, a traveler led by a resident Imam.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The traveler started his salah without wudu and completed the salah with the Imam. Then afterwards he remember that he entered the salah with the resident Imam without wudu. In this case, he makesup his salah as two rakah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second situation, the same as this one however during the salah he looses his ritual purity. Say for example a minor ritual impurity but this is during the salah. In this case he makes up his salah as four rakah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Can you see the difference between these two situations?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ÙØ¹Ù, so in the second situation his salah now linked to the Imam. But in the beginning he didn&#8217;t enter the salah. So his salah with him is two rakah initially. With the first situation he didn&#8217;t enter the salah because he didn&#8217;t have the state of purity to begin with. In the second, it is linked but it was then nullified. So, in this case he does the four rakah in the second situation to makeup and the first situation he brings two rakah. And this happens, this really happens a lot and the people don&#8217;t know what to do in terms of the makeup.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So at the first place the first person&#8217;s salah wasÂ not commenced in the first place and what is due upon him is two rakah for the problem. So in this case he didn&#8217;t enter any salah to begin with. So therefore he makesup his salah as regularly two. At the second situation, his salah commenced with the Imam correctly in the beginning, but it was corrupted during the salah. He lost his wudu after commencing the salah with the Imam. So in this case he makes it up as four.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">My son travels abroad to attend football (soccer) matches in the lands of the unbelievers; what is your advice for me and for him regarding this matter?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Salih Fawzan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[My advice] is that he is to have <strong>Taqwa</strong> of Allah and not to follow this game that has no benefit, rather it is harmful, and that he not travel for its sake to the lands of the unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong> [football] is useless. and <strong>secondly</strong>, travelling to the lands of the unbelievers is not permitted except for a necessity, for medical treatment, to learn something special only they have and which we need, or for trade, this is alright.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and I send prayers and blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Should a Person Pray in an Airplane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . He should offer the voluntary prayers in an airplane while he is sitting in his seat in whatever direction the airplane was facing, indicating the bowing and prostrating (by inclining his head), making the prostration lower than the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He should not offer the obligatory prayers in an airplane, unless he is able to face towards the Qiblah throughout the whole of the prayer and he is also able to bow, prostrate, stand and sit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is unable to do that, he should delay the prayer until he lands at the airport and then pray on the ground. If he fears that the time for the prayer will expire before the airplane lands, he should delay it until the time of the next prayer. This is the case if it is one of those prayers that may be combined with another, such as Zuhr with &#8216;Asr or Maghrib with &#8216;Isha&#8217;. If he fears that the time for the next prayer will expire, he should pray them both in the airplane before the time ends and perform whatever conditions, pillars and obligations of the prayer he is able to. For example: If the airplane took off just before sunset and the sun set while he was in the air, then he should not offer the Maghrib prayer until the airplane lands at the airport, he disembarks, and then prays on the ground. But if he fears that the time for offering the Maghrib prayer will expire, he should delay it until the time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; and offer them both together, combining them and delaying the Maghrib prayer until the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer after he descends. But if he fears that the time for the isha prayer will expire &#8211; and it expires at midnight &#8211; he should offer them before the time expires in the airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The manner of performing the obligatory prayer in the airplane is to stand facing the Qiblah and make the Takbir. Then he recites Sural Al-Fatihah and the words which it is prescribed to recite before it, such as the opening supplication (Du&#8217;a Al- Istiftah) and some Qur&#8217;anic Verses after it. Then he should bow, then straighten up from bowing, and relax in a standing position, then prostrate, then straighten up from prostration, and relax in a sitting position, then prostrate again, then do likewise in the remainder of the prayer. If he is unable to prostrate, he should sit and indicate the prostration while sitting, and if he does not know the Qiblah, and no one reliable can inform him of it, he should use his judgement and try to ascertain it, then pray according to his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The prayer of the traveller in an airplane is shortened, so he performs the four Rak&#8217;ah prayer as two Rak&#8217;ahs like other travellers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very regrettable thing with regard to this matter which is the carelessness of some women concerning travelling by airplane without a Mahram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are very negligent in this matter: One finds women travelling by airplane alone, and their <strong>justification</strong> for doing this is that they say that her Mahram escorted her in the airport from which the airplane took off and the other Mahram will meet her in the airport at which the airplane lands, and that in the airplane she is safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This justification is weak in reality, because the Mahram who accompanies her does not admit her onto the airplane, he only admits her to the departure lounge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may also be that the airplane is delayed in taking off and so this woman remains lost, or the airplane might take off and then be unable to land at the intended airport due to some reason or another, and so it lands at some other place, else and so this woman will be lost. Or, the airplane might land at the intended airport, but the Mahram who is supposed to meet her does not arrive due to one reason or another, such as illness, sleep or a car accident which prevents him from getting there, or something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if all of these things did not happen, and the airplane landed at the correct time of arrival and the Mahram who was supposed to meet her was present, there might be some man sitting next to her on the airplane who does not fear Allah, the Most High and does not respect the worshippers of Allah, and he might be attracted to her and she to him, which might lead to Fitnah (temptation, trial) and unlawful deeds, as is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent upon a woman to fear Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and not to travel except with a Mahram. It is also incumbent upon women&#8217;s male guardians whom Allah has made protectors and maintainers of women to fear Allah, the Almighty, the Ail-Powerful, and to avoid being negligent to those they are Mahrim for, and losing their zeal and their religion, for a person is responsible for his family.Â Because Allah, the Most High has made them a trust for him; He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Q. 405. If a traveller arrives in Makkah and he is fasting, should he break his fast in order to gain strength to perform &#8216;Umrah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. We say that the Prophet (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ) entered Makkah on the twentieth of Ramadan in the year of the conquest of Makkah and he was not fasting, and he led the people of Makkah in a two Rak&#8217;ah prayer and he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh, people of Makkah! Complete the prayer (i.e. pray four Rak&#8217;ahs), for we are travellers</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)Â did not fast for the remainder of the month, because he was a traveller, so the journey of a person performing &#8216;Umrah does not end with his arrival in Makkah, and he is not obliged to fast if he arrives while not fasting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Some people might continue to fast even while they are travelling, thinking that to fast while travelling in the present day is not difficult for people. So, they will continue fasting even while travelling, then they arrive in Makkah and feel tired, and so they say to themselves: Should I continue my fast and delay the &#8216;Umrah until after I have broken my fast, or should I break my fast in order to perform the &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah. We would say to them in these circumstances: It is better for you to break your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah, in order to perform this rite.Â </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Because when the Prophet (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ) entered Makkah and he was performing his religious rites, he would go straight to the Masjid, even making his camel kneel outside the Masjid, entering it in order to perform the rites, for he was so preoccupied with it. Therefore, for those who perform &#8216;Umrah, breaking your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah briskly is better than remaining in a state of fasting, then performing your &#8216;Umrah after you have broken your fast at night.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed from the Prophet (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ) that he was fasting on his journey to the battle for the conquest of Makkah, and the people came to him and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allah! Fasting has become difficult for the people and they are waiting to see what you will do.&#8221; And this was after &#8216;Asr, but the Prophet (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ) called for water and drank it while the people were watching. [2] So, the Prophet broke his fast during his journey, indeed, he broke his fast at the end of the day, and all of this was in order to make it clear to his people that this was permissible. Fasting while travelling, as some do, in spite of difficulty, contradicts the Sunnah; of this there is no doubt. To this applies the statement of the Prophet (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not righteousness to fast while on a journey.</strong></span> &#8221; [3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 6430</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on a Muslim who boardsÂ a crowded plane and is forced to one of the following cases?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">1. A group of women surround him; two on each side, one in front of him and a fourth one behind him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 2. He sits face to face with a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) woman, Arab or other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 3. He sits beside a non-Mahram woman who may be very old.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 4. His seat faces the flight hostess who sits in her seat for a short period after takeoff and before landing of the plane. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes, there are no empty seats left on the plane, or the passengers refuse to exchange seats so that the crew cannot do anything to help him change an inappropriate situation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>If traveling by plane is necessary and the cases you mentioned are inevitable, you should choose the case which involves less Fitnah (temptation) based on the rule of applying the lesser of two harms or evils.Â Additionally, you should lower your gaze as much as possible.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>However, if traveling by plane is not necessary and you have other alternatives, you should avoid that to guard your faith.</strong></span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> by The <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, AllamaaâÂ </em>Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2595 â From Jabir bin Abdullaah who said that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> Â passed by a man who kept turning over on his back and front out of severe hunger, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked the people about him.Â  They said: âHe is fasting O Prophet of Allaah.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ordered him to break his fast, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">âIs it not sufficient that you are in the path of Allaah and with the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that you have to fast.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad, and its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em> upon the conditions of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">âIn this hadeeth is a clear evidence that it is not allowed to fast while travelling if it is harmful to the person fasting, and the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> applies to him: âIt is not from righteousness to fast while travelling.â Or the Messengerâs <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying: âThose are the disobedient ones.â As for anyone else then he has the choice, if he wants he can fast and if he wants he can break his fast. This is a summary of what the hadeeth in this issueÂ  intended, and there is no contradiction between the Ahadeeth, and all praise belongs to Allaah.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[âSilsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehahâ vol.6/1 â No. 2595]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented on another hadeeth in âSilsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehahâ:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2884 â The hadeeth of Hamzah bin âAmr al-Aslami <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> when he asked the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about fasting whilst travelling and the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">âWhichever of those is easier for you then do it. i.e. not fasting in Ramadan or fasting while travelling.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Tamam in âal-Fawaidâ and its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">âI brought the research of this wording here, firstly to reference this hadeeth to its source, and secondly to include the reason as to why the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> allowed this and let the traveler have the choice of fasting or breaking the fast, and that is the explanation of this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are completely different as is witnessed and well known from their different capabilities and their different natures (i.e. Physically and in terms of <em>Taqwa</em>) so for some people it is easier to fast along with the people and not make up for it, when they have finished fasting. And others differ so they do not fast because of the allowance not to, and then they make up the fasts later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His prayers upon the unlettered Prophet to whom it was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[âSilsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehahâ vol.6/2 â No. 2884]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Â Shaykh al-Albani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albani quotes from the book âFiqh-us-Sunnahâ :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">ââ¦.if a traveller does not find another traveller to lead him in prayer, then he should shorten the prayer and pray by himself.Â  It is disliked to be led in prayer by a resident person.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albani says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">âI say: As for this dislike, then even though it is devoid of evidence, it also opposes the Sunnah which was narrated by the scholar of the<em>Ummah</em>, Abdullaah bin âAbbas <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Musa bin Salamah mentioned: âWe were with Ibn Abbas in Makkah and I said to him: âWhen we are with you we pray four rakat prayers and when we return to our temporary residences we pray two rakat prayers?âÂ  He answered: âThat is the Sunnah of Abul-Qassim <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.ââ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Narrated by Ahmad with an authentic chain and it was also narrated in a summarized form by Muslim, Abu âAwaana and other than them.Â  It has been researched in âal-Irwaaâ (571).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from âTamam al-Minnahâ p.371 by Shaykh al-Albani</p>
<p><strong>Additional evidence reported from Saheeh al-Bukhari</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jaabir bin âAbdullah who said, âMuâadh bin Jabal used to pray with the Prophet and then go to lead his people in prayer once he led the <em>âIsha</em>â prayer and recited Soorat âAl-Baqarah.â Somebody left the prayer and Muâadh criticized him. The news reached the Prophet and he said to Muâadh, âYou are putting the people to trial,â and repeated it thrice (or said something similar) and ordered him to recite two medium Suras of Mufassal.â (âAmr said that he had forgotten the names of those Suras).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also narrated by Jaabir bin âAbdullah that Muâadh used to pray with the Prophet and then go and lead his people (tribe) in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both hadeeth have been mentioned in the Book of <em>Adhan</em> from Saheeh al-Bukhari</p>

Undesirability of departing from or coming to a Place stricken by a Epidemic</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:78)</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1791.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) set out for Ash-Sham (the region comprising Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan).

They informed him that an Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â had broken out in Syria. Ibn `Abbas relates: `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said to me: &#8220;Call to me the earliest Muhajirun (Emigrants).&#8221; So I called them. He sought their advice and told them that an epidemic had broken out in Ash-Sham. There was a difference of opinion whether they should proceed further or retreat to their homes in such a situation. Some of them said: &#8220;You have set forth to fight the enemy, and therefore you should not go back;&#8221; whereas some of them said: &#8220;As you have along with you many eminent Companions of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu Âalayhi wa sallam), we would not advice you to set forth to the place of the plague (and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;You can now go away.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Call to me the Ansar (the Helpers).&#8221; So I called them to him, and he consulted them and they differed in their opinions as well. He said: &#8220;Now, you may go.&#8221; He again said: &#8220;Call the old (wise people) of the Quraish who had emigrated before the conquest of Makkah.&#8221; I called them. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) consulted them in this issue and not even two persons among them differed in the opinions. They said: &#8220;We think that you should go back along with the people and do not take them to this scourge. `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) made an announcement to the people, saying: &#8220;In the morning I intend to go back, and I want you to do the same.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree?&#8221; Thereupon `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Ubaidah ! Had it been someone else to say this.&#8221; (&#8216;Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) did not like to differ with him). He said: &#8220;Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree to the Divine Decree. What do you think if you have camels and you happen to get down a valley having two sides, one of them covered with foliage and the other being barren, will you not act according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in vegetative land? In case you graze them in the barren land, even then you will be doing so according to the Divine Decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There happened to come `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf who had been absent for some of his needs. He said: I have knowledge about it. I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu Âalayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you get wind of the outbreak of plague in a land, you should not enter it; but if it spreads in the land where you are, you should not depart from it</span>.&#8221; Thereupon `Umar bin Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) praised Allah and went back.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1792.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu Âalayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;I<span style="color:#0000ff;">f you get wind of the outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; and if it breaks out in a land in which you are, do not leave it.</span>&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against traveling to non-Muslim countries and outlining its dangers</b><b>on `Aqidah and manners</b><b>Â [1]</b></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, Alone. May peace and blessings be upon whom no Prophet shall come after, our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family, Companions, and followers till the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) has blessed the Muslim nation with many favors, distinguished it with unique characteristics, and made it the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind when it enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil and believes in Allah (Exalted be He). Indeed, the best thing Allah (Exalted be He) bestowed upon it is the Religion of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) chose Islam as the Shari`ah (revealed teachings and laws) and way of life for His Slaves and completed His Favor upon His Slaves and perfected the religion by Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Exalted be He) says,Â </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you IslÃ¢m as your religion</span></em>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">Â <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 3</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, the enemies of Islam feel envy towards Muslims owing to this great favor and are filled with spite and rage as well as enmity and hatred toward Muslims and Islam. They wish to deprive Muslims of this favor as Allah (Exalted be He) says describing what occurs in their psyches:Â </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 89" target="_blank" name="TheywishthatyourejectFaith,"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected Faith, and thus that you all become equal (like one another)</span></em>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">Â <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 89</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:Â </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 118" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotas"></a><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O you who believe! Take not as (your) BitÃ¢nah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the AyÃ¢t (proofs, evidence, verses) if you understand</em></span>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">Â <span class="webkit-html-attribute-value" style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 118</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:Â </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 2" target="_blank" name="Shouldtheygaintheupperhand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you should disbelieve.Â </span></em><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 2</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:Â </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 217" target="_blank" name="Theyaskyouconcerningfighting"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (IslÃ¢mic Monotheism) if they can.Â </span></em><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 217</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that speak about the enmity of disbelievers towards Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, what I want to refer to here is that the disbelievers exert effort and search every way in order to realize their purposes to damage Muslims. They use numerous ways and many concealed and apparent means in order to reach their evil purposes. Among their ways is what some travel institutions do from time to time such as distributing publications which promote people in this country <strong>to spend summer holidays in</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Â EuropeÂ </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Â America</strong>Â </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext of learning English and they offer inclusive programs for the entire time for the one who travels with them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The following things are always included in their programs:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Choosing a non-Muslim family with which a student will live in spite of the great risks included in this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- Attending music parties and shows performed in the city where the student lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">3- Going to dance and entertainment clubs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">4- Disco dancing with non-Muslim girls and participating in dance competitions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">5- It is mentioned about the entertainment centers in one of the non-Muslim countries that they include the following things: nightclubs, discos, jazz and rock parties, modern music, theaters, cinemas and bars. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, these publications aim at many dangerous purposes, such as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Working towards deviating the Muslim youth and leading them astray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- Spoiling manners and tempting people to commit adultery by making it obtainable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">3- Filling Muslims with doubts concerning their doctrine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">4- Developing in the Muslims who go there a sense of admiration and amazement with the culture of non-Muslim countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">5- Promoting Muslim to adopt many of their bad traditions and customs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">6- Urging heedlessness towards religion and its morals and teachings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">7- Utilizing Muslims who go there so that they call others to travel to non-Muslim countries afterÂ returning from these journeys and being filled with the thoughts, customs and traditions of the disbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are many other dangerous purposes and objectives that the enemies of Islam strive to achieve like gaining as much power as they could and using various apparent and concealed ways that serve their aims. <strong>These evil-minded people may work under Arabic names and national institutions; conspiring against Muslims, keeping suspicions away from them, and concealing their wicked aims from Islamic countries.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Therefore, I am here to warn my Muslim brothers who are living in this country in particular and in all Muslim countries against being deceived and influenced by these publications and not to respond to them. These publications are nothing but some evil-oriented plans by the enemies of Islam that aim at taking Muslims out of their religion, arousing doubts in them over their doctrine and sowing the seeds of discord among Muslims. Allah (Exalted be He) says about them in His Book,Â </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 120" target="_blank" name="NeverwilltheJewsnortheChristians"></a><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ ÙØ³ÙÙ) till you follow their religion</em></span>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">Â <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 120</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, I direct my <strong>advice to the guardians of students</strong> in particular to take care of their children and not to respond to their requests concerning traveling to non-Muslim countries owing to the expected harms and corruption in religion and manners. Praise be to Allah, we, in our countries, have education in various kinds of sciences which suffice from traveling to foreign countries. There are many places of entertainment in our country that are useful substitutes for theirs. In this way, we can protect our young people from the previously mentioned dangers, troubles, harmful results, and difficulties which are encountered in foreign countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I invoke Allah (Exalted be He) to protect our country and all Muslim countries and our children and Muslims&#8217; children from every evil and harm and to save them from the conspiracies and mischief of our enemies. I supplicate Him to turn their evil plots on them and to guide our rulers and all Muslim rulers to abolish these harmful publications and dangerous reports and to guide them to all that benefits the people and the countries for He is the One Who is Capable of doing so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions, and followers till the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
Fusool fis-Siyaam wat-Taraaweeh waz-Zakaat [Upcoming E-Book]<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Lesson Three: The Ruling on a Sick or Traveling Person Fasting</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>And whoever amongst you is sick or on a journey, then (he may make up) the same amount of missed days on other days. Allaah wants ease for you and He doesnât want to make things difficult for you.â </b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person falls into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> Whoever has an illness that is permanent and there is no anticipation of it being cured (near term), like cancer for example, this person is not required to fast. This is because he does not have a condition in which it is expected that he will be able to do it (i.e. the fast). However, for every day missed, he must feed a needy person whether if it is by him gathering the same amount of needy people as the days he missed and feeding all of them at once as Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu âanhu</i>) used to do when he was old, or it could be by dividing up the food for the needy people according to the days missed and then giving every needy person a quarter of a Prophetic <i>saaâ</i>, i.e. what weighs about half a kilo and 10 grams of good wheat. It is better if one serves meat or fat along with it in order to compliment the meal. The same applies to an elderly person that is not able to fast, in that he should feed a needy person for every day missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Whoever has a temporary illness that they will recover from, such as a fever and what resembles that. This kind of illness has three scenarios:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Fasting will not burden or cause harm to him. Such a sick person is obligated to fast since he has no excuse to abandon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Fasting will be difficult on him but it wonât cause any harm to him. In this situation it is detested for him to fast because one is actually refraining from using Allaahâs allowance, while at the same time he is burdening himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Fasting will harm him. In this situation, it is forbidden for him to fast because of the harm that he will be inflicting upon himself. Allaah says: <b>âAnd do not kill yourselves. Verily Allaah is All-Merciful to you.â</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>âAnd do not throw yourselves into destruction with your own hands.â</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>âThere is to be no harming (of others) nor harming (of oneself).â</b> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Al-Haakim, and An-Nawawee said: âIts paths of narrations strengthen one another.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can find out if fasting will be harmful to a sick person by (1) that person feeling it to be harmful on himself or by (2) him being informed of it by a trustworthy doctor. When a person who falls under this category of being sick breaks his fast, he must make up the number of days he missed when he recovers. But if he dies before he recovers then making up the missed days is no longer binding upon him, since he is only obligated to fast the number of days missed on other days, which he was not able to reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A traveler falls into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> Whoever intends by traveling to cheat his way out of fasting. It is not permissible for such a person to break his fast, since cheating oneâs way out of Allaahâs obligations does not remove those obligations from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Whoever does not intend the above by traveling. This person may fall into one of the following three situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Fasting is extremely difficult upon him. In this case, it is forbidden for him to fast since one time âThe Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) was fasting while on the military expedition to conquer Makkah, when news reached him that the people found it difficult to fast and they were looking at him to see what he would do. So he (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) called for a cup of water after âAsr and drank from it while the people were looking at him. Later it was said to him: âSome people are still fasting.â So he (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) replied: <b>âThose are the disobedient ones. Those are the disobedient ones.â</b>â [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Fasting is difficult upon him, but not so severe. In this situation it is detested (makrooh) for him to fast since he is refraining from one of Allaahâs allowances, while putting a burden upon himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Fasting is not difficult upon him. In this case he may do whatever is easiest on him â whether it is fasting or choosing not to fast. This is based on Allaahâs statement: <b>âAllaah wants ease for you and He doesnât want to make things difficult for you.â</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word âwantâ here takes on the meaning of love (i.e. He loves ease for you). If there is no difference between fasting or not fasting, then fasting is more preferable, because this is what the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) did, as is reported in Saheeh Muslim from Abud-Dardaa (<i>radyAllaahu âanhu</i>) who said: âWe went out (on a journey) with the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) during Ramadaan under intense heat conditions to the point that each of us would put his hand over his head (to cover it) due to the severe heat (of the sun). And no one would be fasting among us except for the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) and âAbdullaah bin Rawaaha.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A traveler is considered to be traveling from the time he leaves his country to the time he returns to it. And if he takes up residency in the land he travels to for a period of time, he is considered to be traveling as long as he holds the intention that he will never reside there after the objective for which he traveled there for in the first place is fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is entitled to all of the allowances a traveler has even if the length of his residency extends for a long time. This is since the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu âalayhi wa sallam</i>) did not mention any time limit defining when a travel ends. And the foundation with regard to this issue is that one remains in a travelerâs state and under its rules until there comes a proof that the travel has ended and that its rules fail to apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference in breaking the fast while traveling between a time-constrained travel, such as Hajj, âUmrah, visiting a relative, business travel, and so on and between a continuous travel, such as journeys made by car service drivers such as taxis or other larger forms of transportation (i.e. buses). When these drivers exit from their countries, they all enter into the state of travelers and it is permissible for them to do whatever other travelers are permitted to do, such as not fasting during Ramadaan, shortening the four rakâah prayers into two rakâahs, and combining the Dhuhr and âAsr prayers and Maghrib and âIshaa prayers, when there is a need for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abstaining from the fast is better for them than fasting, if that is easier for them. And they can make up the days missed during the winter. This is because these car service drivers have their own country, which they ascribe to. So when they are in their country, then they are considered residents and whatever applies for or against all other residents also applies for and against them. And when they travel, they are considered travelers and whatever applies in favor or against travelers also applies in favor or against them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Taken from </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8220;A Summary of Islamic Jurisprudence&#8221;</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by Sheikh Salih Al-Fawzan , Vol 1 , pg 238 &#8211; 241</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A traveler is one of the excused persons for it is permissible for him to shorten the prayer consisting of four rak&#8217;ahs ( units of prayer ) to only two rak&#8217;ahs as stated in the Noble Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition ) , and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah , Exalted be He , says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And when you travel throughout the land , there is no blame upon you for the shortening prayer ..&#8221; </strong> (Qur&#8217;an : An-Nisa:101 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover , the Prophet (Peace be upon him) performed only shortened prayers on his journeys [7]. Furthermore , on journeys , shortening the prayer is better than completing it according to the majority of scholars . It is narrated in the Two Sahihs that Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her ) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the prayer was enjoined ( by Allah ) , it was two rak&#8217;ahs (units of prayer ) only ( in every prayer ) both when in residence or on a journey . Then the prayers performed on journey remained the same , but ( the rak&#8217;ahs of ) the prayer for non-travelers were increased.&#8221; [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar (may Allah be pleased with him ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The prayer performed on journeys is of two rak&#8217;ahs . This is the complete prayer without shortening.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim on a journey is to start shortening the prayer as soon as he leaves his town or city as Allah permits the shortening of prayer for those who travel through the land . Before leaving his town, a Muslim is not legally considered a traveler through the land (and hence he is not permitted to shorten the prayer ) . The Prophet ( Peace be upon him ) used to shorten the prayer as soon as he left his hometown . So, if a person does not travel from the residential land , he is not considered a traveler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A traveler is permitted to shorten the prayer even if he frequently travels , as in the case of a mail carrier or a taxi driver who spends most of his time on the way between towns.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for a traveler to combine the Zuhr prayer and the Asr ( Afternoon ) prayer at the due time of either of them , and, likewise , to combine the Maghrib ( sunset ) prayer and the Isha ( night ) prayer at the due time of either of them . That is because what makes it permissible for the traveler to shorten prayer makes it permissible for him to combine prayers as well .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However , shortening prayer is a temporary permission valid when there is a necessity , as in the case when traveler is in haste on his journey. Mu&#8217;adh ( may Allah be pleased with him ) narrated :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8221; on the Battle of Tabuk , when the Prophet (Peace be upon him) had gone forth before the Sun passed the meridian , he would delay the Zuhar prayer and combine it with the Asr prayer , performing them together . But when he proceeded after the sun had passed the meridian , he would perform the Zuhr and the Asr prayers ( at the time of the Zuhr ) and then he would proceed. ( He acted similarly for the Maghrib prayer. ) When the sun had set before he proceeded , he would delay the Maghrib prayer and combine it with the Isha prayer , performing them together . But when he proceeded after sunset , he would perform the Isha prayer and the Maghrib prayer at the time of the Maghrib prayer &#8220;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Related by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi ) [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a traveler stops on his journey , to take a rest , it is better for him to perform each prayer shortened at its due time , not to combine prayers . If it is difficult for a Muslim patient to perform each prayer at its due time , then he is permitted to combine the Zuhr prayer and the Asr prayer ( at the duetime of either of them ), and to combine the Maghrib prayer and the Isha prayer ( at the due time of either of them ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul &#8211; Islam Ibn Taymiyah said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allah has ordained shortening of prayer to remove difficulties and make things easy for the Muslim nation . So , a Muslim is permitted to combine prayers when necessary . All hadiths (related to this matter ) imply that it is permissible to combine two prayers at the due time of either of them in order to remove any possible hardship caused to the Prophet&#8217;s nation. Thus , it is permissible to combine prayers if it is to cause hardship if not done. This proves that it is permossible with greater reason for a Muslim patient to comine ( two ) prayers at the due time of either of them as long as it is difficult for him to perform each prayer at its due time . &#8220;</em> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyah also said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8221; Patients can combine the prayer according to the Sunnah for it is narrated in two hadiths that the Prophet ( Peace be upon him ) ordered a mustahadah [12] to combine the prayer . &#8220;</em>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By means of analogical deduction with the case a <em>mustahadah</em> , the combining of prayer is permitted for every Muslim who cannot purity for every prayer, such as those inflicted with enuresis , a continuously bleeding wound , or a permanent nosebleed .The Prophet ( Peace be upon him ) said to Hamnah Bint Jahsh when she asked him about istihadah [14] ( vaginal bleeding other than menstruation ) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;But if you are strong enough to delay the Zuhr prayer and advance the Asr prayer ,to wash , and then combine the Zuhr and the Asr prayers; (and ) to delay the Maghrib prayer and advance the Isha prayer , to wash , and then combine the two prayers, do so .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Related by Ahmad , Abu Dawud , and At-Tirmidhi and deemed sahih ( authentic) by the latter ) [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to combine the Maghrib prayer and the Isha prayer , in particular , if there is rain that wets clothes and causes difficulty ( for those who go to the mosque ). The Prophet ( Peace be upon him ) combined the Maghrib prayer and the Isha prayer in a rainy night [16] , and so did Abu Bakr and Umar afterwards [17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykul &#8211; Islam Ibn Taymiyah ( may Allah have mercy on him ) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8221; According to the soundest view of scholars , it is permissible for a Muslim to combine prayers because of mud or strong cold wind in a dark night , even if it has stopped raining . This is more incumbent than performing each prayer at its due time at home . Moreover, to abandon combining congregational prayers in mosque to perform prayer at home is a bid&#8217;ah ( a matter innovated in religion ) that contradicts the Sunnah ( Prophetic tradition ) . It is an act of the Sunnah to perform the Five ( obligatory ) prayers in congregation in the mosque , and this is more due , according to the unanimous agreement of Muslims , than performing prayers at home. In addition, congregational prayer combined in the mosque is more due than performing prayers at home individually, according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars who maintain the aforementioned permissibility to combine prayers ( due to bad weather ) , such as Malik , Ash-Shafi&#8217;i and Ahmad </em>. [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better for one permitted to combine prayers to combine them according to what suits his / her situation most. On the day of &#8216; Arafah , it is better ( for the pilgrims ) to combine the Zuhr prayer and the Asr prayer at the time of the former [19], but in Muzdalifah , it is better ( for the pilgrims ) to combine the Maghrib prayer and the Isha prayer at the time of the latter , according to what the Prophet (Peace be upon him) did ( in his Hajj )[20] . On the day of Arafah , pilgrims combine the Zuhr and the Asr prayers at the time of the former in order to continue staying at &#8216; Arafah mount (without interruption), but in Muzdalifah, they combine the Maghrib and the Isha prayers at the time of the latter to continue moving toward Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general , it is an act of the Sunnah for pilgrims to combine prayers on the Day of Arafah and in Muzdalifah but in circumstances other than that , it is permissible when necessary . However , when there is no necessity , it is better for a traveller to perform each prayer at its due time . During the days of his Hajj , the Prophet (Peace be upon him) combined prayers only on the Day of &#8216; Arafah and in Muzdalifah , but he (Peace be upon him) did not combine prayers in Mina because he was to stay there . So the Prophet (Peace be upon him) used to combine prayers only when he was in a hurry on a journey . We invoke Allah to guide us to useful knowledge and good deeds .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to preserve both the man and woman&#8217;s honor and to safeguard their hearts from temptation, and as a means of blocking the pathways that lead to corruption, a woman is restricted from traveling alone without a mahram. This is since if a woman is accompanied by a mahram, he will preserve her, safeguard her and take care of her needs. The ProphetÂ  said: &#8220;It is not lawful for a woman that believes in Allaah and the Last Day to travel the distance of two days unless accompanied by a mahram.&#8221;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration it states: &#8220;a day and a night&#8221;[4] while in another narration it states: &#8220;to travel&#8221; without specifying a time-frame.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is intended here is that a woman should not travel alone without a mahram. If she does so, i.e. travels without a mahram, she would be disobeying Allaah and His Messenger, committing what Allaah has forbidden and exposing herself to fitnah. This applies generally to all situations and time periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for what some people claim Â­ that if a woman travels accompanied by a group of other women, this takes the place of a mahram Â­ then this is a view that is in opposition to the Prophet&#8217;s statement: &#8220;It is not lawful for a woman that believes in Allaah and the Last Day to travel the distance of a day unless accompanied by a mahram.&#8221;</span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of women do not serve as a mahram for a woman. The mahram of a woman is well-known Â­ it is a male that she is forbidden to marry due to family-ties, such as her father, her son, her paternal uncle, and her maternal uncle&#8230;or due to some allowable reason, such as marital ties, like the father of her husband or the son of her husband, or such as foster-suckling ties based on the Prophet&#8217;s statement: &#8220;Foster-suckling makes forbidden that which is forbidden due to family-ties.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a woman&#8217;s mahram is any male that she is forbidden (to marry) due to a family-tie or some allowable reason. This forbiddance (of marriage) must also be endless, i.e. everlasting. So what doesn&#8217;t fall into this category is the temporary (marital) forbiddance such as the wife&#8217;s sister and the wife&#8217;s paternal and maternal aunt. This marital forbiddance is only applicable for a prescribed time. This is why the husband cannot serve as a mahram for his wife&#8217;s sister even though he is forbidden from marrying her since this marital forbiddance is temporary. In the same manner, he cannot be a mahram to his wife&#8217;s maternal and paternal aunt. This is what a mahram is. As for a group of women, they are not a mahram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ProphetÂ  stipulated that a woman be accompanied by a mahram when traveling under all circumstances, regardless of whether she travels by foot, on a riding beast, in a car or by airplane.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people today claim that there is no problem if a woman travels by <strong>airplane</strong> and her mahram dispatches her in the departure airport while another mahram picks her up at the arrival airport. We say: No, this is not permissible, since she has traveled without a mahram. And the ProphetÂ  said: &#8220;It is not lawful for a woman that believes in Allaah and the Last Day to travel the distance of two days unless accompanied by a mahram.&#8221; This applies to whether she travels on foot, by car or on a riding beast. The ProphetÂ  did not specify. However, the cause is there, and it is due to the fitnah that is feared will befall her Â­ even if she is on an airplane. So she is not safe from fitnah even on board a plane.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Furthermore, let&#8217;s suppose for example that the airplane is forced to change its destination and so it lands in a different country Â­ who will pick her up in this other country? That is why there must be a mahram present along with the woman.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is such that once a man came to the ProphetÂ  and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, I have enlisted for such and such battle expedition, but my wife has gone out for Hajj.&#8221; The ProphetÂ  told him: &#8220;Go back and make Hajj with your wife.&#8221;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ProphetÂ  turned this man away from battle so that he may accompany his wife on Hajj and serve as a mahram for her. This is proof that having a mahram is a condition for a woman to travel on Hajj or to other places, regardless of whether she is with a group of people or not. This is why the scholars of Fiqh, may Allaah have mercy on them, mentioned that one of the conditions in which Hajj becomes obligatory on a woman is when she has a mahram available to travel with her. So if one is not available for her, she is then not obligated to make Hajj until a mahram does become accessible for her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor â </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 247</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #2<em>: </em>Why did you complete (your prayer)? [The <em>shaykh</em> was led in prayer during his journey, then the <em>imaam</em> shortened but the <em>shaykh</em> did not shorten (the prayer), so he was asked about that]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">âThe matter of being considered a traveler, in my understanding, does not depend on crossing a fixed distance as much as it depends on two things, the foundation of which is the intention, and the other is leaving the city/country. <strong>So if there is the intention to travel, and he leaves the city/country, the rulings of traveling are applicable (to him); and after that, the distance that he crosses is not regarded, whether long or short.</strong> As for (if) the fundamental principle is not present, which is the intention, then this (person) who left (the city/country) is not a traveler even if he crossed a long distance or less or more, because traveling is one of the rulings that are linked with this<em> hadeeth</em>, about which some of the scholars of <em>Islaam</em> have said that it is a third of<em> Islaam</em>: âActions are only by (their) intentions and every person will have only that which he intended.â[1] And the truth is that this is a very sensitive issue about which the views of the scholars have differed and they did not agree on something completely clear such that it would be possible for someone to say: âThis is the truth, it is quite obvious, so leave the side issues off of me.â No one can say this, but all that he can say is: âI chose such and such.â</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I chose â what I understood from the treatise of <em>Ibn Taimiyah</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) regarding this matter. He has a special treatise about the rulings of traveling. Indeed he struck a very wonderful example, from which the researcher and student of knowledge understand that traveling has nothing to do with crossing a long distance over a short distance. As for (saying) that it has nothing to do with crossing a short distance, then I think this is not an area of debate, because it is established from the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>âalayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) that he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] used to leave from <em>Madinah </em>to <em>al-Baqeeâ</em>(graveyard); then he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] would greet them (the dead) with the <em>salaam</em>, then return. He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] used to go out to the martyrs, to <em>Uhud;</em> he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] would greet them with the <em>salaam</em>, then return. He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] did not consider himself a traveler although he [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] left the city. And the opposite of that as well â if he crossed a long distance, that does not mean that he became a traveler merely because of crossing this distance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example that (<em>Ibn Taimiyah</em>) struck is as the following. He was from Damascus like me, and there are well-known towns around Damascus, so he struck an example with a city known up to this time as Duma. He said, if a man seeking game[2] left from Damascus to Duma (which is) 15 kilometers (away) â there is no doubt that (crossing) this distance is (considered) traveling according to our custom if the fundamental condition exists, which is the intention to travel â (<em>Ibn Taimiyah</em>) says that this man is not considered a traveler because he had left for hunting then for returning. But what happened was that he did not find the game that he was looking for, so he continued on the journey, and continued and continued, and kept going on until he reached where? â Aleppo; and there are approximately 400 kilometers between Aleppo and Damascus today by car. (<em>Ibn Taimiyah</em>) says this (man) is not a traveler â although he had crossed (many) distances of the traveler, not just one distance â because the first condition, which is the intention to travel, was not there in this person. Thus, we can say that a car driver leaves early in the morning from â<em>Ammaan</em> for instance to reach <em>Maâaa</em><em>n</em>(then) to <em>al</em>-â<em>Aqabah,</em>[3] returning by evening; this (person) is not a traveler because he, due to his work, does not intend to travel; rather he intends to carry out this work to make a living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, regarding the subject of traveling, we must take into consideration the fundamental condition, which is the intention. <strong>And by us taking into consideration this intention, the ruling differs for two persons who cross one and the same distance, but one of them is a traveler and the other is not considered a traveler because of the difference in their intentions</strong>. And in this manner, there also occur rulings related to the ruling of residency, i.e. residency that is planned for a specific time. (For example), two men left a city, both as travelers; they landed in another city. The staying of one of them is that of a traveler (but) the other one is a resident. Why? Because (this second man) has another wife there, so he (goes) from one wife to another wife. Thus, because of there being a wife for him who causes him to be chaste, gives him a home and arranges his accommodations for him, he takes a ruling other than that of his companion because the situation differed in some ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we learn of a very important conclusion, which is that <strong>the exact rulings of traveling differ from one person to another. So, we donât assign to a person the ruling of another (person)</strong>, and also the opposite likewise.â</p>
