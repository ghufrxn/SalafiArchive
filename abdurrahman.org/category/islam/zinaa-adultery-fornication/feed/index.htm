<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 96</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> and marrying a woman merely to make her lawful for her previous husband (<em>al-Isti<u>h</u>laal)</em> are forbidden till the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F393947286&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/temporary-marriage-of-convenience-al-mutah-is-forbidden-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> (jurisprudence). However, he brought it here because it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). Because <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) is to declare as lawful something which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made forbidden. And what this term <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) means; to marry a woman for a certain set period whether it be long or short and after it, then the marriage ends automatically and does not require divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mut`ah</em>; this temporary marriage, it used to be permissible at the beginning of Islaam and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade it at the Battle of Khaybar.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Then he permitted it on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then he forbade it forever.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to begin with, it was lawful then it was made forbidden. Then it was permitted then it was forbidden forever. And the Muslims are united in consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> that it is forbidden and that it is <em>nikaa<u>h</u>un baa<u>t</u>il</em> (baseless marriage). And there is consensus of this nation that it is forbidden, no-one disagrees with regard to that except for the <strong>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Ja`firee Shee`ah</strong>. They are the ones who contradict with regard to it. And their differing is not counted and has no value. So there is consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) and text to show that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> is forbidden. It is a futile marriage and it has the ruling of <em>zinaa</em> (fornication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><em>“al-Mut`ah tan-nisaa,”</em> </strong>Why did Imaam al-Barbahaaree say <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em>, meaning <em>Mut’ah</em> of the women, excluding by that <em>Mut`ah</em> of Hajj, which is that a person does <em>Tamattu</em>`, performing `Umrah and then performing Hajj. This is not what is meant here, for Hajj <em>Tamattu</em>` is what was supported by the majority of the People of Knowledge and no-one disagrees with regard to it except a small number but as for <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em> of the women meaning temporary marriage, then it’s forbidden by consensus, no-one disagrees about it from those whom disagreement is counted. Whereas, Mut’ah in Hajj is a matter of fiqh but as for Mut’ah, which is temporary marriage, then it is a matter, which has a connection to aqeedah (creed and belief) because it is making permissible that which Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made forbidden.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Khaybar, the well-known battle against the Jews of Khaybar in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (4,261) and also reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,407) from Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade temporary marriage to the women on the day of Khaybar and he forbade eating the meat of domestic donkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <u>H</u>adeeth for that reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,406) from Sabrah al-Juhanee that, He was with Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O people, I have permitted you to take pleasure from the women and Allaah has forbidden that now until the Day of Resurrection. So, whoever has something from them then let that go on its way and do not take from anything that you have given to them.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded us with <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage) in the year of the conquest when we entered Makkah then we did not depart from it until he had forbidden us from it.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 36 : Point 49</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger cannot lawfully be shed except on account of one of three matters; fornication after having been married or one who turned apostate after having <em>daleel</em> or one who murders a believing soul without right then he is executed for it, other than that then the blood of the Muslim is unlawful for the Muslim to shed forever until the Hour is established</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F375298469&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-blood-of-a-muslim-cannot-lawfully-be-shed-except-on-account-of-one-of-three-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issue of killing a Muslim comes after the issue of marriage because Islaam came to protect matters of honour and to protect blood from being shed and to protect property. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Your blood and your wealth and your honour are forbidden for you.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“All of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim; his blood and his property and his honour.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having spoken about <em>al-a`raa<u>d</u></em> (matters of honour) in the previous sentences in what is connected to marriage and divorce, he moved onto the matter of preservation of blood from being shed. So, the Muslim when he bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah then his blood and his property become forbidden to shed. And therefore, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So, if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property safeguarded from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah, the Most High</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever announces his Islaam and utters the two testifications then we accept that from him and we count him as being a Muslim and we apply the rulings of the Muslims upon him even if in his heart there is hypocrisy (<em>nifaaq)</em>, for that will be between him and Allaah. Allaah will bring Him to account and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>accepted Islaam of the hypocrites (<em>munaafiqeen)</em> and he applied the outward rulings upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever commits one of those things that nullifies Islaam then in that case he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy). So, either he will then repent or otherwise, he will be executed as a protection for the religion. This is the <strong>first matter</strong> that renders the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second matter</strong> from those things that renders the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed is <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory killing); <em>an-nafsu bin-nafs</em> (a life for a life).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَاءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۗ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh you who believe <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (legal retribution) for those who have been murdered is prescribed for you. The free person for the free person and the slave for the slave and the female for the female and whoever pardons and overlooks for his brother and accepts payment of blood money instead then this should be adhered to with fairness and payment of blood money should be made in a good manner. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. So, whoever then transgresses after acceptance of the blood money and kills the murderer then for him there will be a painful punishment. And there is for you in <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u> </em>(legal retribution) the saving of life, O people of understanding, that you may become righteous</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 178-179)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution) results in the preservation of life even though the murderer is killed because a would-be murderer, if he knows that he’s going to be killed, he will withhold from killing. And the rest of the people, if they see the murderer being killed then they will stop themselves from killing. So therefore, blood will be safeguarded on account of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution) is a means for preservation of life and even though the one upon whom retribution is taken is killed then it is a killing which leads to preservation of life of the rest of the society and transgression against blood will be reduced. As for the case, if the murderer were to be left and it were to be said this contradicts human rights and he were to be left and not executed then this will result in the shedding of blood and destruction of security and causing those people who are in a state of security to instead be in fear and it will bring about many evils and killing will increase and bloodshed will occur to the extent that they used to say even in the times of ignorance (<em>jaahiliyyah),</em> “<strong>Execution is the best deterrent to murder</strong>.” So, killing the criminal is the best deterrent to murder in the future and in this regard is the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is for you in legal retribution the saving of life, O people of understanding.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>179)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those people who say that <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory killing) runs contrary to human rights then we say to them that the person who’s being transgressed against, “Is he not a human?” So, in taking retribution, there is protection for his right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>third</strong> of those whose blood it is lawful to shed is the <em>thayyib</em> (one who’s married or has been married) who commits zina (fornication). <em>Ath-thayyib</em> is the person who has had sexual relations with his wife in a correct marriage. So, if he then after that commits <em>zinaa</em> (fornication) then he is stoned to death with stones until he dies and his blood is rendered lawful on account of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, these are the matters which render the blood of a Muslim lawful to be shed. Either <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliatory execution for murder) a life for a life or one who commits fornication after being married or <em>al-murtadd</em> (the apostate); the one who has left the religion of Islaam, the one who commits something, which breaks a person’s Islaam. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever changes his religion then kill him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And the one who abandons his religion and leaves the Jama’ah (united body).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this contains a refutation of those who deny the punishment for apostasy seeking to use as evidence his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is to be no compulsion upon the religion.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this use of evidence is an error because killing the apostate; it&#8217;s goal is not to force anyone to accept the religion. Rather, the goal from it is <strong>to protect the religion</strong> from being played around with by someone who has entered into it freely by choice and then he abandons it after having borne witness that the religion is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the blood of a Muslim person who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is not permissible,” </strong>the Muslim is the one who bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. However, along with the two testifications, there must be action that he establishes the prayer and gives the <em>Zakaah</em> and fasts Rama<u>d</u>aan and performs the <u>H</u>ajj to the house for whoever is able to make his way to it; action is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whatever is besides that then the blood of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim to shed forever until the Hour is established,” </strong>the blood of the Muslim is forbidden for the Muslim. There will not come a time when it is permissible for him to shed the blood of a Muslim ever for Allaah unless he transgresses against and attacks the people in their homes or he commits Highway robbery or revolts against the authority of the ruler or other than that then he is killed to repel his evil if his evil cannot be repelled except through killing him.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6,878) and Muslim (1,676) from `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The blood of a Muslim who bears witness than none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah is not permissible to be shed except on account of one of three cases; a life for a life and a previously married person who commits fornication and one who abandons his religion and leaves the Jamaa`ah.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Reported by al- Bukhaariyy (6,878) and Muslim (1,676) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his famous book <em>Al-Mughnee</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The People of Knowledge are united in consensus upon the obligation of killing the apostate and that is reported from Aboo Bakr and `Umar and `Uthmaan and `Aliyy and Mu`aadh and Aboo Moosaa and Ibn `Abbaas and Khaalid <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhum</em> and others besides them and no one criticised that from them so it is <em>Ijmaa</em>` (consensus).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Imaam an-Nawawi mentioned in his explanation of Muslim in the book <em>Kitaab al-Imaarah</em> (Book of Leadership) when he’s speaking about the <u>h</u>adeeth of Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s</em> sending of Aboo Moosaa al-Ash’aree to Yemen then later on he sent Mu`aadh to go to Yemen after him so when Mu`aadh arrived, he found that there’s a Jewish man there captured who had accepted Islaam and then left Islaam and become a Jew again; he was awaiting execution. So Aboo Moosaa offered a cushion for Mu`aadh to sit down so Mu’aadh refused, “till you kill him”. Imaam an-Nawawi commented upon that <u>h</u>adeeth and said, <span style="color:#993300;">“It shows the obligation of killing the apostate and they are agreed in consensus upon his killing.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn `Abdul-Barr said in his book <em>At-Tamheed</em> when he was speaking about the narration of `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em> when he killed the apostates. Ibn `Abdul-Barr then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The <em>fiqh</em> of this <u>h</u>adeeth is that whoever apostasizes (leaves his religion) then his blood becomes lawful and his neck is struck, meaning he’s beheaded and the ummah is united upon that.”<em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And I say and it is not permissible to kill any soul except for one of these three by consensus and success is granted by Allaah.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And stoning is true.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/stoning-the-adulterer-or-adulteress-is-true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has forbidden some things relating to matters affecting peoples&#8217; honour or relating to dealings and other than that.; and these forbidden matters are divided into categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Forbidden things which are major sins<br />
&#8211; Forbidden matters which are lesser sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then with regard to the punishment upon the one who commits them, they are divided into three categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first category:</strong></span> forbidden things for which Allaah has laid down prescribed punishments. They are called <span style="color:#003300;"><strong><em>al-hudood</em> prescribed punishments</strong></span> from the word <em>al-hadd</em> (limit); it means <strong>prevention</strong>. They are called that because they prevent from falling into these sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second category:</strong></span> forbidden things which Allaah has not laid down prescribed punishments for, however there is <span style="color:#003300;"><strong><em>ta`zeer</em> (discretionary) punishments</strong></span> for them; and it is left to the discretion of the ruler in accordance with whatever he sees will be a deterrent from them. And this is called <em>ta`zeer</em> and it is a <span style="color:#003300;"><strong>correctional</strong> </span>punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third category:</strong></span> that which does not have a laid down prescribed punishment nor does it have a discretionary punishment from those forbidden things. However, there does occur with regard to it <strong>a threat and a mention of anger and curse and Fire</strong> and other than that from the types of threat; such as consuming usury and gambling and other than that. With regard to this there is a severe threat which will deter whoever has eemaan (true faith) in his heart. And whoever does not have eemaan in his heart or he is weak in faith, then in front of him there will be a <strong>reckoning and a punishment in the Hereafter</strong>. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has made forbidden these forbidden matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah made obligatory duties obligatory, so do not neglect them. And He made some things forbidden, so do not commit them. And He remained silent about some things as a mercy upon you, not out of forgetfulness, so do not ask about them.</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from these prescribed punishments is the prescribed punishment for fornication. And fornication is to commit illicit sexual intercourse in the private part of one not lawful for him, except through correct legislated marriage contract.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who guard their private parts, except upon their wives or the slaves whom their right hands possess. For they are not blameworthy. And whoever seeks something beyond that, then they are the transgressors.</span></strong> (Sooratul- Ma`aarij (70), aayah 29 &#8211; 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning those who go beyond what is lawful and enter into that which is forbidden. So whoever enters into fornication, then he will be one of two categories. Either if he is a virgin, meaning he has not had relations with a woman in a lawful marriage which kept him chaste, he is a virgin, then his punishment will be that he will be lashed one hundred times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the female fornicator and the male fornicator, lash each one of them with a hundred lashes. And let not pity deter you from obedience to Allaah, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Noor (24), aayah 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the authentic Sunnah that he should be exiled, meaning banished from his land where he committed the illicit sexual relations and sent to another land for a the period of one year. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>For a virgin committing it with a virgin, then the punishment is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.</strong></span> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So exile is confirmed in the Sunnah. As for lashing then it is established in the Qur&#8217;aan. And the scholars are agreed in consensus upon lashing, and the majority of them also agree upon exile. This is with regard to the punishment for the virgin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong>previously married person</strong>, and he is the one who has had relations already with the wife in a correct marriage, and he recognizes the value of peoples honour and the sanctity of peoples honour. And this person, he is stoned with stones until he dies. And this is established in the Qur&#8217;aan whose wording was abrogated, but whose ruling remained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> said upon the mimbar of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The aayah of stoning came down and we comprehended it and we preserved it. And Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stoned. And I fear that if a time becomes prolonged for the people, that they will start to say, ‘We do not find stoning in the Book of Allaah’. Indeed it is in the Book of Allaah.</strong> </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was Qur&#8217;aan whose wording was abrogated, but whose ruling remained. And Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stoned and he commanded stoning. And the Muslims are agreed in consensus upon that. And no one disagreed about it, except for the people of innovations, those whose disagreement is not taken account of such as the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So stoning is established in the Book and in the Sunnah of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sayings (Sunnah qawliyyah) and his actions (Sunnah `amaliyyah) and by consensus. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So whoever denies it is a disbeliever, because he is denying that which Allaah has said and His Messenger and the consensus of the Muslims</span>. So stoning is established. There is no scope for speech about it. And therefore he stated it here and said “Stoning is true”. This is the creed and belief of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah in refutation of the innovators, those who deny stoning without knowledge and without clear insight, because of their ignorance and because of their childishness in regards to knowledge; and they are relying upon their intellects and their own thinking. And those people are not counted. No notice is taken of them and their sayings are not looked at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sometimes an ignorant person can come claiming awareness and to have researched and say, “There is disagreement about this.” So it is said to him, “Is it the case that every disagreement is taken account of?! There are matters of disagreement which are totally discarded and not counted. And from them is this disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the writer of the lines of poetry said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Not every disagreement that comes about is taken account of, except that which has of correct examination.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is not just claims of disagreement. The matter is one of verification of what is correct and tying it to the proof. So whoever goes against the proof, then he is defeated in the argument and there is no weight given to his disagreeing, and he is not counted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you disagree about anything, then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and the last day, that is the better and finer in its outcome.</span></strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we do not just remain upon there being disagreement, rather we refer back to the proof, because of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the last day, that is the better and finer regarding its outcome.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the author rahimahullaah he stated the issue of stoning even though this book is a book of creeds and beliefs, because <span style="color:#ff0000;">it is obligatory to believe in the obligation of stoning; and whoever denies it has become a disbeliever.</span> So therefore he stated it as a refutation of the innovators who deny stoning. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This hadeeth occurs as no. 30 in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth. It is reported by at-Tabaraaniyy in alMu`jamul-Kabeer, Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, ad-Daaraqutniyy in his Sunan, al-Haakim in his Mustadrak, al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa and others. It was declared hasan good by an-Nawawiyy in RiyaadusSaaliheen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translators side point:</strong> It occurs as a hadeeth of Aboo Tha`labah al-Khushaniyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said with regard to this narration in Ghaayatul-Maraam (no. 4), “This narration is actually da`eef (weak). Makhool did not meet Aboo Tha`labah.” However in the same book Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declares hasan (good) the narration which bears some resemblance with this one, which is the hadeeth of Abud-Dardaa· <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whatever Allaah made lawful in His book, then it is lawful. And whatever He made forbidden, then it is forbidden. And whatever He remained silent about, then it is pardoned. So accept from Allaah that which He has pardoned for Allaah would not forget anything.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord never forgets.</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth reported by al-Haakim and declared hasan by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1690) as a hadeeth of `Ubaadah ibnus-Saamit <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You also find that same narration from a different Companion reported by alBukhaariyy, also by Aboo Daawood, at-Timithiyy and Ibn Maajah. This wording actually occurring in the text is the wording of Ibn Maajah. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared it likewise saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6829). Also reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1691) from a narration of `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation that from the established Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed he stoned Maa`iz [reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6824)] and the woman connected with the employee [al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6828)] and the woman of the Juhaniyy tribe, al-Juhaniyyah [Muslim (no. 1696)]. And he stoned two Jews who had committed fornication [al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6841)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> passed away and this ruling remained being acted upon. And the khulafaa· stoned after him.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.&#8221;</strong></span> &#8211;  Surah No.17 Al-Isra , Aaayat 32</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, forbidding His servants to commit Zina or to approach it or to do anything that may lead to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (immoral sin)) meaning a major sin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and an evil way.)</strong> meaning, a terrible way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, <strong>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commit Zina (unlawful sex).&#8221;</strong> The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; But the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Come close)</strong> The young man came to him, and he ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Sit down)</strong> so he sat down. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their mothers.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your daughter)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their daughters. )</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your sister)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their sisters.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your paternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your maternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.)</strong> Then the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on him and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.)</strong> After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">A FRIDAY SERMON BY: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, there is a certain well known pastime of tribulation and temptation into which many people fall today. Unfortunately, this issue does not negatively affect only the individuals who fall into it. Rather, its consequences affect others as Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Beware of a trial which will not afflict only those who have transgressed among you exclusively, and know that Allah is severe in penalty.</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, the tribulations to which I refer are temptations pertaining to (the unlawful admiration of) women, and it is such trials about which the messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will not leave behind a trial more harmful to men than (the temptations of) women.</span></strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a trial which the shameful ones readily partake in, one that affects their desires, blinds their eyes, and destroys their judgment. This eventually leads them to following women around in the streets and shopping malls, flirting with them, whistling at them and whispering to them. They may even go so far as to touch or grope women in public as if they are completely unconcerned with others around them. Perhaps they see others as insignificant as if they were cattle. This is because such people are immersed in their own lust. They belittle morality and they defy societal norms. They are fearless before Allah (Azza wa Jal) as they choose ways (to support their desires) other than the respectable ways of sensible people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must, as a believing Muslim people, renounce these activities perpetrated by such immoral individuals. We detest these types of behaviors because they contradict the characteristics and qualities of believers in Allah and the last day. We disapprove of such actions because they are means leading one closer to adultery or fornication about which Allah (تعالى)  says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not approach adultery, fornication. Certainly, it has always been immoral and an evil way</span></strong>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We condemn this behavior (of chasing after women, watching them desirously, flirting with them, etc.) because it infringes upon personal safety and security, and it could lead to community fear, panic (among women), and societal disorder. And we criticize it because it may inevitably bring about a swift, overwhelming and inclusive punishment. Allaah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When we intend to destroy a town, we command its affluent ones, but they defiantly disobey. So the word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.</span></strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, <strong>&#8220;We command&#8221;</strong> is a type of universal responsibility befitting those of affluence and power (to enforce change in society). Allah mentions the <strong>&#8220;affluent ones&#8221;</strong> because it is often the rich and powerful who immerse themselves in sin. And if they refuse to change, <strong>&#8220;The word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</strong> After mentioning His punishment for adultery and fornication (among other sins), Allah then speaks about the exception, those who will avoid punishment, the true worshippers of the Most-Merciful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does that incurs sin. The punishment will be multiplied upon him and he will abide therein disgraced, except for those who repent, believe, and do righteous deeds. For them, Allah will replace their bad deeds with good ones and Allah is ever forgiving, merciful.</span></strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, You who try to safeguard your dignity and protect the women in your care, immoral qualities and shameful behaviors such as these to which some people degenerate—and such behavior was not prevalent in our society until recently—weaken your religion, weaken your honorable protectiveness of women, and spread the means leading to tribulations and societal problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Weakening of One’s Religion</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s religion, these people who follow women around, being tested with admiring and flirting with them, had they been strong in religion, they would not dare do the kinds of things they do with women. Such actions result in their sinning against Allah (azza wa jal)  and preoccupying themselves with and giving preference to the creation instead of the creator. Allah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Tell the believing men to lower their gazes and protect their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of everything they do.</span></strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Weakening of One’s Honorable Protectiveness of Women</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s honorable protectiveness – the praiseworthy type of respectful jealousy one should have of women – individuals afflicted with this temptation to “chase women,” had they had the complete respectful honor for women, they would not dare chase after the women of their brothers (in faith), the women (sisters, daughters, mothers) of their fellow citizens, thereby putting those women into the same types of temptations and tribulations. The type of religious brotherhood we have obliges men to respect and honor his brothers’ womenfolk and those of his fellow citizens, having the same kind of commendable jealousy for their honor and chastity as he has for his own female relatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would ask these men: Would you be happy to know that someone chases after your own wife out of desire for her? Or your daughter, your sister, or other female relatives? Would you like people flirting with them? If he would hate such behavior with his own women, why would he allow his own desires to tempt him into doing the same things with other women? I warn these individuals who have been afflicted with such admiration of women from the very actions which would allow another man to gain influence over his own women. I advise them to prevent his relatives from becoming afflicted with such trials.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Spreading of Tribulations &amp; Societal Problems</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations and temptations to admire and chase after women are many. Such behavior (because of its popularity and influence) leads to various forms of widespread media, including audio, visual, and written publications, being placed in the hands of our young men and women. They have newspapers and magazines filled with images and articles that arouse their desires, stimulate their emotions, and kindle the fires of passion. Even worse than this media is that which comes to our land from abroad, or sometimes even from our own citizens. We ask Allah to guide them and to protect us from their evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another way this tribulation may spread is by the very blessings which Allah has bestowed on this land: the comfort of its society, its excess wealth, good food, and the overall security and prosperity of our society. Oftentimes, such luxuries lead one’s heart to become empty and the body to become idle from inactivity or unemployment. This is why you almost always find these young men to be one of two types. They are often unsuccessful men who have no careers to occupy their time or attention. They live off the prosperity of other wealthy, successful men. They neither know a skill, nor try to learn one. They do not work towards a specific occupation or official career. Thus, his desires get the better of him and leave him in a perpetual downfall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or they may often be men who may work but they waste the results of their labor, wasting their earnings, unconcerned with its value or what results from the bad consequences of their actions. But as for a dignified, determined believer, he does not allow his personality to deteriorate to the point of such shallow yet despicable behavior. Other ways these temptations spread is what some women of immoral conduct themselves perpetrate in their choice of clothing, their appearance, and lustful behaviors. By these choices, they are inclined to promote this type of tribulation. Such conduct was foreign to our righteous predecessors. Some women go to shopping centers to flaunt themselves, to exhibit their beauty with the most attractive clothing they own. They may then throw over it a thin cloak but one that might be shortened or raised up so that her attractive clothing underneath is displayed. They are dressed yet still appear naked, wearing the types of garments the women of Hell wear. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of the people of Hell that I have never seen: (1) People with whips like the tails of cattle with which they beat people, and (2) women who are dressed but appear naked, walking with an enticing strut with their heads looking like the humps of camels. They will never enter Paradise, nor even smell its fragrance although its scent can be perceived from such and such a distance. [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some women also frequent shopping centers adorned with gold jewelry or elegant watches, walking in such a manner and revealing her hands (in an attractive, seductive way) to entice those who see her even though Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They (believing women) should not strike their feet in such a manner that the adornment they hide may be known</strong></span>. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women go out perfumed, sometimes choosing to wear the strongest, most fragrant perfume so that almost every man she passes who smells her scent, she allures him with it. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said about this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Any woman who has been around incense should not join us in the last evening prayer.</span></strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A woman, if she wears perfume and then passes by a gathering (of men), she is this and that (meaning: a type of adulterer, fornicator).</strong> </span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women frequent the malls unveiled or wearing a thin veil that barely conceals her face. Perhaps it is even worn as a way of beautifying her face, or just to hide some blemish on her face. Still other women may cover their faces yet they wear the veil so tightly that their nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are shown. These are no doubt temptations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You also find women roaming shopping centers in a strutting, swaying manner and joke and giggle with their girlfriends. Sometimes they visit shops, with or without need, to chat with the salesman, prolonging their conversation. Perhaps she requests an item stored in the back of the shop that she actually does not want; she just wants to keep chatting with the salesman. Yet Allah (Azza wa Jal) told the prophet’s wives and they were considered the “mothers of the believers,” they were the most pure and farthest from any behaviors or situations of temptation – Allah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not be soft in speech (to men) for fear that he in whose heart is a disease should desire (you), but speak in an honorable manner.</strong></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, we have described some things regarding the sickness but is there a cure? The answer is yes and there are several types of medicine thanks to Allah. We are a Muslim nation practicing the religion of Islam, and Allah (Azza wa Jal) has clarified the general responsibilities a man has regarding his family members and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has spoken about this as well. As for Allah (Azza wa Jal) He says in His noble book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You who believe, protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are (appointed) angels, stern and severe. They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do as they are commanded.</strong></span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The leader is a shepherd and responsible for his flock (i.e., citizens). A man is a shepherd over his family and responsible for his flock. A woman is a shepherd in her husband’s home and responsible for her flock. And a servant, worker is a shepherd over the property of his master, boss. So each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.</strong></span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Worshippers of Allah, fear Allah and fulfill your responsibilities. Continuously prevent and discourage the women in your care from visiting shopping centers to behave in manners that contradict religious rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to help us and you with regards to the medicine of integrity and honor, to guide us and guide others with us for He is capable of all things. All thanks are for Allah, the lord of the worlds, and may Allah send peace and prayers on our prophet, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn continues in the second part of his Friday sermon…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslim brothers. You, men who are caretakers of women, men who are responsible for your families, fear Allah with respect to yourselves and families. Cultivate in them respectable manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and discourage them from becoming the very means which lead to temptations and tribulations. You are men and they are women and men have been charged with taking care of women because of what Allah has given one over the other and because men (are obliged to) spend their wealth to support them. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man should neither be (helpless, having no influence) as if he were simply a rock in his house, nor should he be as if he is one of the women. Rather, he must act like a man in every sense of the word. Be shepherds; be responsible and influential so that you live among your families as men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people go to great measures to ensure their financial stability, carefully watching their expenses, their checkbooks and bookkeeping. Yet they neglect their family members for whom they are personally and immediately responsible. Such a man, were he to lose a single sheep from his flock (a single coin, for example), he would search right and left for it until it is found. All the while, he remains unconcerned that his family members, his sons and daughters, are losing their manners and good character.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are protectors and maintainers of women by what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend (to support them) from their wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fulfill the obligations Allah has placed over you. This is my advice I present to you as I remind you that you are responsible for your families because Allah told you this and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has charged you with this. Do you want to waste this trust you have been given? Do you want to be unable to answer when you are made to stand in front of Allah and asked about this trust?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allah and take seriously the obligations Allah has placed on you. Do not neglect and waste your chances at raising your family. If you fail in the upbringing of your family and this man fails his family and that man fails, soon the entire society becomes corrupt. Society is a conglomeration made up of individuals, so when the individuals become corrupt the entire population is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conclude this speech of mine asking Allah (Azza wa Jal) to assist us and you all in fulfilling our responsibilities we have regarding the safeguarding of our families. Oh Allah, help us care for our families, providing the best care for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s Explanation: [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[10] The selections here are from Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn. Since the chapter in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn where the ḥadīth under discussion appears includes preceding verses of the Quran related to lowering one’s gaze, his explanation of those verses have also been included here for the benefit it contains and its relevancy to this translated work.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The chapter in al-Nawawī’s Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (in which the ḥadīth under discussion appears) begins with the following verses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Tell the believers to lower their gaze.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Sūrah al-Nūr (24:30)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at non-relative women is forbidden as the author رحمه الله says and that is because Allah commanded that we lower our gaze as He says &#8220;<strong>Tell the believers to lower their gaze and preserve their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of what you do</strong>.&#8221; He instructs us to lower our gaze and guard our private parts, and this indicates that when someone does not restrain his gaze, that becomes the very means by which he may fail to preserve his private parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is liberal with his eyes, allowing them to roam freely, his heart becomes infatuated with women. He continues to look at them until he may approach a woman, speak to her, carry on a conversation with her, arrange a date with her, and then finally the immorality (of adultery) happens. We seek protection with Allah from this. This is why the look has been called “the messenger” or “delivery” of adultery; it invites to illegal sexual activity, and this is why Allah commands us to lower our gaze.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He عز وجلalso says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit and what the breasts conceal&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Ghāfir (40:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;eyes’ deceit&#8221; is the visions a person’s sight may steal (when looking at impermissible things). In other words, a person may secretly look at something forbidden when people cannot observe him. However, Allah certainly knows what he is doing because &#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah جل وعلى also knows &#8220;what the breasts conceal&#8221; of both good and bad intentions. He even knows the ideas a person’s own soul may inwardly suggest to him and what he accepts of those suggestions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah تعالى also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Surely the hearing, the sight, and the heart – of each of those one will be questioned&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Isrā (17:36)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person is accountable for his hearing and will be questioned about it. What did he listen to with his ears? Did he listen to impermissible speech or to a woman, enjoying the sound of her voice? Likewise an individual is accountable for his sight and heart so it is critical that a person safeguards himself (regarding his senses). As for a woman relative or someone to whom it would be forbidden for him to marry anyway, there is no problem with looking at her. He may see her face, her head, her hands, her arms, her legs and feet; there is no problem with any of this unless there is some sort of temptation he fears for himself. If he feels there would be some temptation for him, then he should not even look at women that are religiously considered as his female kin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a man had a “sister” because his mother breastfed another girl in infancy who was originally unrelated to him, if such a woman was considered beautiful in his eyes, then looking at her would not be permissible even though a sister of breastfeeding is considered by the religion to be of the same status of an actual, related sister. If he feels some kind of temptation by looking at her, he must then lower his gaze when with her. She must also cover up when she is with him because the origin and purpose behind the ḥijāb (the religious covering) is to prevent temptations. So if she finds some sort of temptation, then she too must cover her face even in front of related men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if there is no such temptation present and a person is chaste with a normal, sound and un-perverted heart, then he is only forbidden to look at nonrelative women not in his immediate family, for example his cousins, his sisters-inlaw, etc. In conclusion, the important point is that a man may look at women religiously considered to be his immediate relatives as long as no sort of temptation is there. As for looking at unrelated women, they are never permissible for him to look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following ḥadīth, with the wording from Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, is the one mentioned in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (and the same one mentioned on pg. 2-3 of this work).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated that the prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It has been written upon the Son of Adam his share of adultery which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it. The two eyes, their adultery is looking (at what is forbidden). The two ears, their adultery is listening. The tongue, its adultery is speaking. The hand, its adultery is the touching, and the foot, its adultery is walking (toward adultery). The heart desires and hopes (for adultery) but the private parts either confirm that or deny it. » which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it « means every individual will carry out and realize his inevitable share of adultery, and there is no escape from it unless Allah protects him from doing so.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم then mentioned some examples such as,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two eyes, their adultery is looking « When a man looks at unrelated women, even if it is without desire, it is a form of adultery – adultery of the eye.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two ears, their adultery is listening « A man may listen to a woman speaking and become moved by her voice; this is the adultery of the ear. Similarly,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The hand, its adultery is the touching « which is anything physically done with the hand like touching or similar physical actions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» the foot, its adultery is walking « and this includes when someone walks to any place wherein immorality and sexual activity is being committed. It could also be when a man hears a woman’s voice and he walks over to her or sees a woman whom he then approaches. These are all types of adultery – adultery of the foot.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The heart desires « and may be inclined toward adultery, becoming infatuated with women and this is the adultery of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» but the private parts either confirm that or deny it « In other words, if a person commits adultery with his private parts—we seek protection with Allah from that—he has then actualized the adultery of all his other senses and limbs. In contrast, if he does not commit adultery with his private part, choosing instead to safeguard and preserve himself, he then denies his other senses their forms of adultery.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth shows the extreme caution required to prevent one’s heart from being attached to women. A man must avoid becoming obsessed with their voices, looking at them, touching them, or approaching them. He has to prevent his own heart’s infatuation with the allure of women as all of these are types of adultery, and we seek protection from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every individual of sound intellect and chastity must beware and take precautions to ensure nothing of his senses or body parts become obsessed with women. Anytime a person senses himself being allured to any of that, he must retreat and keep far away (from actualizing any forms of adultery) because Satan courses through the Son of Adam like blood runs through him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the initial glance can be a poisonous arrow from Iblīs. For example, a man may glance at a woman while unconcerned with her at first sight. However, with the second look then the third he finds his heart becoming attached to her, Allah forbid. He may become so in love with that woman that he thinks of nothing but her. Standing, sitting, when he sleeps and when he wakes up, he thinks of her. And this is how the evil and temptation begins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for wellbeing and all success is from Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><b>Chapter 290<br />
Prohibition of gazing at women and Beardless Handsome Boys except in Exigency</b></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things).</b></span><b>&#8221; (24:30)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allah)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (17:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal</b></span><b>.&#8221; (40:19)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, your Rubb is Ever Watchful (over them)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (89:14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1622.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has written the very portion of Zina which a man will indulge in. There will be no escape from it. The Zina of the eye is the (lustful) look, the Zina of the ears is the listening (to voluptuous songs or talk), the Zina of the tongue is (the licentious) speech, the Zina of the hand is the (lustful) grip, the Zina of the feet is the walking (to the place where he intends to commit Zina), the heart yearns and desires and the private parts approve all that or disapprove it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wording in Muslim; Al-Bukhari wording is a bit short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1623.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Avoid sitting on roadsides</span>.&#8221; His Companions said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), there is no other alternative but to sit there to talk.&#8221; Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you have to sit at all, then fulfill the rights of the road</span>.&#8221; They asked: &#8220;What are their rights?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Lowering the gaze (so that you may not stare at unlawful things); refraining from doing some harm to others, responding to greeting (i.e., saying `Wa`alaikumus-salam&#8217; to one another) and commanding the good and forbidding the evil.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1624.</b> Abu Talhah Zaid bin Sahl (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We were sitting and talking on a platform in front of our house when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stopped by us and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Why do you sit on roads? Avoid sitting in them.</span>&#8221; We replied: &#8220;We sit there intending no harm. We only sit and discuss (religious) knowledge and talk.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you have to sit, you should fulfill the rights of the road: Lower your gaze, respond to greetings and talk in a good manner</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1625.</b> Jarir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about (the Islamic ruling on) accidental glance (i.e., at a woman one is not Islamically allowed to look at) and he ordered me to turn my eyes away.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1626.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) along with Maimunah (May Allah be pleased with him) when Ibn Umm Maktum (May Allah be pleased with him) (who was blind) came to visit him. (This incident took place after the order of Hijab). The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told us to hide ourselves from him (i.e., observe Hijab). We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he is blind and is unable to see us, nor does he know us.&#8221; He replied; &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Are you also blind and unable to see him?</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1627.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man must not look at a man&#8217;s private parts nor must a woman look at a woman&#8217;s private parts; neither should two men lie naked under one cover, nor should two women lie naked under the same cover</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 291<br />
Prohibition of Meeting a non-Mahram Woman in Seclusion</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen</b></span><b>.&#8221; (33:53)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1628.</b> `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Avoid (entering a place) in which are women (uncovered or simply to mix with them in seclusion)</span>.&#8221; A man from the Ansar said, &#8220;Tell me about the brother of a woman&#8217;s husband.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The brother of a woman&#8217;s husband is death</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1629.</b> Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No one of you should meet a woman in privacy unless she is accompanied by a Mahram (i.e., a relative within the prohibited degrees)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1630.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The sanctity of the wives of Mujahidun (i.e., those who strive hard and fight in the way of Allah) for those who remain at home (i.e., those who do not go to the battlefield to fight Jihad) is like the sanctity of their own mothers. Anyone who remains behind to look after the family of a Mujahid and betrays his trust, will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection before the Mujahid who will take away from his meritorious deeds whatever he likes till he is satisfied</span>.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned toward us and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Now, what do you think (i.e., will he leave anything with him)?</span>&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah &#8216;Ateeq al-Harbee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah &#8216;Ateeq al-Harbee is one of the professors in the University of al-Madeenah, he is a student of Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh began by giving his salutation after sending peace and blessings upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) and after praising Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: O Muslims indeed Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created us and He has not left us to our own desires. Indeed He has prohibited us and He has given us command and He has made it clear to us the path of khair and the path of good and He has encouraged us to follow that. And He has made clear to us the path of evil and has prohibited us from following that. And indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala is more knowledgeable concerning that which is good and that which has the best for His servant in this life and the Hereafter. And He is the Most Knowledgeable concerning that which will give them bliss and that which will give them good fortune in this life and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed from the things that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has made it important and placed importance upon<br />
protecting it and upon making sure that the Muslims are mindful with regards to it and that He has prohibited us and made us something that we should be distant from corrupting and that is the honour of the Muslim and that is going to be the title of the talk. And indeed it has been established in a hadith in Saheeh al-Bukhari that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said : &#8216;indeed your blood, and your wealth and your honour, is haraam upon you (it is prohibited upon you) just as this day is haram or considered sacrilegious and just as this month is considered sacrilegious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed the honour is something that should be protected by the Muslims in two ways :</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>As for the first way, that which is apparent from the honour of the Muslims : and that is by clothing it using the<br />
garments that the Shariah has laid down and prescribed and what the Messenger has prescribed (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).</li>
<li>And as for the second type is that which is hidden from the honour : and that is to protect it from zina and to protect it from homosexuality and those types of affairs.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said : &#8216;O you who believe, indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has sent down upon you a garment that will cover your modesty and He has given you a leash which is something other than from the standard covering. And indeed from the greatest of things that will make the honour of the Muslim corrupt whether they are male or whether they are female and indeed it is that which is referred to or known as &#8216;zina.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;.. and do not come close to zina. Indeed it is something that is lewd and it is an evil way.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed in this ayah Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has made Haraam anything that leads to zina and that is never mind the actual committing of the act. Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216; and do not come close to fawahish, do not come close to lewdness, that which is apparent from it and that which is hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed the issue of fornication (may Allaah protect us all from it). Indeed along with it being prohibited it is something that likewise corrupts the society, corrupts the community. And indeed it is from the reasons for the spreading of corruption in and amongst the community.&#8217; Insha-Allaah I am going to mentions some of the reasons and some of the things that corrupts the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the first of the evils that come from zina is that it is one of the causes for the spread of many evils and many diseases connected to fornication, just like the sickness of AIDS and other in that from the sicknesses that destroy the lands and destroy the servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise it is from the reasons that causes commotion in and amongst the family &#8212; as far as it relates to the husband or as far as it relates to the wife and to the children and if the family indeed is split, that will lead to the splitting of the community and indeed they will fall into that which are of the lowly actions and will fall into corruptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the evil effects of zina is that it is from the reason for talaaq (or divorce) being plentiful in the societies. Because you find after the marriage, after a small space of time you will find the people divorcing each other and sometimes this happens after a space of few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that it lowers the marriage rates in the society. So as for the person who commits fornication and is constant and regular in doing that, then he does not look to marriage except as another way of having a sexual relationship. Not that it is a beautiful way of uniting two bodies, neither it is a life that is built of love and emotions and raising a family and having children and indeed from bringing and having children, it is by way of those children our that lives become happy lives. And likewise it makes life easy with the presence of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise we see from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that we find the level of children and the level of having kids fall in that particular society. Because when zina is one of the reasons for the spread of deadly diseases like AIDS and other than AIDS, we find as a result of that many people die in the society. And as a result of that we find people having children as a result of that die. And as a result of that also the strength of the community is lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also from the evil effects of zina, is that it leads to much crime in that society. And from that the crimes that generate and likewise a person will enter into stealing and rape in order to satisfy his sexual desires. And likewise as a result of that we find people even killing each other and killing themselves as a result of this spread of this zina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the evil effects of zina, is that we find that we have many children, many offspring that are the children that have come as a result of that fornication. And this likewise is from the sins meaning these children have come about as a product of fornication. This is also from the sins that increases crimes, and increases evil doings in and among society. Because the child from a young age is in need of receiving the love and attention from both his parents. So when the child loses out on that care and loses out on that attention, and when he loses that love, then what happens is that he has a reactory feeling as he grows that he was not nurtured upon love and upon affection. So that breeds from him and lead him to haste and dislike to society and the surrounding that he lives in. So, when he reaches the age of maturity, we find that these individuals enough of time end up themselves being individuals that commit evil acts and committing different crimes in order to avenge that society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And brothers and sisters from the things that we can utilize to protect this evil, to protect ourselves from this evil is by following the message, and the measures and the means that al-Islam has laid down for us. The means have been laid down for protecting our &#8216;ird &#8212; lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the most important means for protecting the limits is the establishment of the belief of Allaah in the hearts of the servant. So if the slave then knows and believes that Allaah is the Creator of the creation, and He is the One that is worshipped and there is none worthy of worship other than Him, then he would carry out his commands and he would stay away from his prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he will believe in his heart that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala knows the hidden things and knows those things which are apparent. And likewise he will know that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala sees everything that takes place in this creation. And so this Imaan of his will carry him to be odd and over keeping in mind the presence of Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. And it will lead him likewise, to be distant from disobeying Allaah and it will make him to carry out Allah&#8217;s commands and the things that please Allaah. So not once will Allaah see him in a place where Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala dislikes to see him in and likewise he will not be absent from places that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala loves for him to be in. And that is a condition with the mu&#8217;min and the believer who is sincere with his Imaan, the one who is certain concerning his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Listen O brother and listen O sister, to the story of that great Sahabah ; that Sahabi who before Islaam used to commit sins as of fornication and he used to visit prostitutes ; look at his condition after his Islaam. Did he continue upon that which he was upon, in his days of Jaahiliyah before Islaam? .. (not clear) &#8230;. And likewise he took upon himself chastity and distanced himself form all evil and all lowly acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This appears in the Sunnan of Tirmidhi that a person from amongst the Sahaba (radiallahu anhu) who was referred to as al-Martad. He used to carry the prisoners of war from Makkah until he reached Medina and there was a woman from amongst the Mushrikeen who was a prostitute or she was a fornicator and her name was &#8216;Anaaq and she was his girlfriend before Islaam. And he had promised a man from amongst the prisoners of war from the people of Makkah that he was carrying. He said to them radiallaahu &#8216;I continued until I came to a wall from the walls of Makkah in the shade of a wall on the full moon night man, so &#8216;Anaaq (this woman) came to him and she had noticed that this man being detained near the wall. So when she came to me she realized that it was me. So I said, &#8216;my name is Martad&#8217; and she said, &#8216;welcome.&#8217; She then said, &#8216;come and sleep with me tonight.&#8217; So she was calling him to the lewdness. So I said, &#8216;O Anaaq, indeed Allaah has made zina Haraam. Allaahu Akbar!&#8217;. So the Shaykh is saying look then brother Muslim may Allaah guide you and myself to success. Look at the Imaan that Martad had concerning Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and how it prevented him from committing zina even though it was easy for him to commit that act. So may Allaah have mercy upon him and be pleased with him. Look how his complete turn around came for him after he was a committer of major sins and major evil deeds prior to his Islaam? Look how Islaam turned the whole direction of his life. And he became the best of the people as regards to him being chaste, as regards to him having adab, and with regards to him having taqwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore from the first of the things that we can utilize to protect ourselves from this sick disease, it is to have Imaan in Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second affair is that we make sincere tawbah to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala for all of our sins. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;and those who when they commit a sin or when they run themselves, they remember Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and make isthighfar for their sins. And who will forgive sins other than Allaah as long as they do not persist upon that which they did while they know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise from the things that will protect ourselves and from the methods and means that have been laid down in the Shariah is that indeed Islaam is the deen of the fitrah and its way is the just way, balanced way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has affirmed for mankind that which he has established or that which he has within him a way of desire for sexual actions. But Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has not made it absolute for him to utilize or enjoy his desire in any way that he pleases. And at the same time He has not prohibited him from enjoying sexual pleasures absolutely but rather it has reigns and orders for him that desire of his. And that sis with the connection of the link of marriage. Because when Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala created mankind, He created for him his wife so that he may receive tranquility from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says, &#8216;and indeed from His signs is that He has created for you wives so that you may<br />
receive tranquility and reside with them. And He has made between you love and He has made between you Mercy.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Allaah has made and prescribed marriage by way or which a person can increase in love and emotional feelings. And a way for him to protect himself from falling into evil deeds and lewd deeds. And for that reason Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) encouraged that we should marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In both Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8216;O gathering of youth, whosoever from amongst you is able then let him marry. Because it is better for the lowering of the gaze. And it is better as a protection of the private parts. And whosoever is not able to do so then let him fast, because then indeed it is a protection for him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the things that protect ones private parts (and things connected to that), that the method of protecting &#8212; &#8211; that men not mix with the women. Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah mentions in his book, &#8216;and there is no doubt that to let the women mix with the men is the origin of every evil. And it is from the greatest reasons for Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala revealing or sending upon the people punishments and likewise it is from the reason that the general and the specific affairs become corrupt. And the men mixing with the women is a reason for zina, fawahisha, lewdness and evil act connected to sexual related acts being committed between men and women. And it is from the reasons for diseases and plagues when the prostitutes began to mix with the army of Musa, and evil deeds and lewdness began to spread among them. Indeed Allaah sent upon them at that point plague and diseases and 70,000 people died as a result of that. And we ask Allaah that He protects us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the protective reasons that has been laid down by the Shariah for the male Muslim and the female Muslim, that the women wear the hijaab and screen themselves from strange men. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says, &#8216;..and stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of the days of Jaahiliyah&#8217; and Allaah azzawajal says addressing his message to his Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : &#8216;O Messenger, say to your wives, daughters and to the women from amongst the Muslimeen, that they should throw the jilbaabs over themselves, that is better for them not to be known or not to be recognized and they will not be harmed. And indeed Allaah is al- Ghaffoor ar-Raheem.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons is that a woman stays in her home and that she doesn&#8217;t leave her home except for a<br />
pressing need. Allaah says in the previous ayah, &#8216;.. stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of jaahiliyah. And you know O servants of Allaah, (O female slave of Allaah) that the Shaitaan who is the major enemy for us utilizes the issue of the women leaving out of their homes, using her as a means of corrupting the men and utilizing the men for corrupting her. And indeed the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) has said, &#8216;indeed the whole of the woman is an awrah. So if she leaves her home, then indeed the shaitaan beautifies her and makes her fall into some type of fitnah and attempts her to fall into some lowly deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from that a person distances himself from music as it is established with the people who have intellect that the beautiful voice has a direct effect upon the heart especially the heart of the woman. Music has an effect more on the woman than it has on the men. And if that music is accompanied with singing and with the playing of musical instruments, the effect that it has on the hearts in calling that person to lewdness is indeed greater. And for that reason Fudayl Ibn Iyyad rahimahullah mentioned that music is the ruqya of zina &#8211; meaning it is the thing that will lead towards it and will draw towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says in the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8216;and indeed from the people of those who buy lahwal hadeed (meaning music here) in order to misguide from the path of Allaah and Ibn Masood radiallaahu anhu swore three times by Allaah regarding the tafseer concerning this ayah and the explanation of the lahwal hadeed that it is ghina, it is music and likewise from the reasons that protect ourselves from this lewdness will be mentioned in a summarized form so that we don&#8217;t spend too long here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them the Shaykh mentions is that a person both men and women lowers their gazes. Because the sight that it takes to look is from the arrows <strong>from the arrows of Iblees</strong>. And for that reason the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained, &#8216;that the first look that you take for a woman is for you i.e it is overlooked and the second one is against you. And that is because the first look that a person took was not intentional i.e he did not intentionally take that look of that woman. So Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala had mercy upon us and forgave us for that. And as for the second look then the mu&#8217;min the male and the female believer are both taken to account for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the woman should not perfume herself when she leaves from her house. Indeed Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) prohibited that. And likewise from the reasons that will protect the society from this is that a woman does not show her beautification or that which she wears underneath her jilbaab except to those individuals who are from her mahrim (Mahram) who are lawful from her relatives.Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said that she should not show anything of her beautification except that which is<br />
apparent from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons that will protect us bi-iznillaah that a woman does not enter in her speech i.e she does not go into too much depth with her speech and that she does not soften her speech to strange men. Whether that is upon the telephone or upon other than the telephone. And this is indeed from the greatest of reasons that leads to that evil. Because indeed if she is soft in her speech, then that one who has something from sickness from his heart , will enter into his heart to have something with her by way of evil actions or by way of adultery or fornication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons that we can protect, is that a person distances himself from intoxicants. Because indeed the khamr and the intoxicant are the mother of all evils. And by way a person would fall into zina and likewise it is a stealing and likewise it is a killing these souls that have been prohibited for us to kill. Rather a person would fall into every type of lowly act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the things that will protect us is that we keep clear from touching in any way a strange woman except in extreme necessity. O Servants of Allaah, indeed when the believer believes in Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala there is no doubt that he is going to be tested and that he is going to be under trial. And for that reason Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala when he created the Jannah, He surrounded it with the distasteful things. It was surrounded by things that are distasteful like Jihaad because a person may possibly die and it is something that is difficult for a person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he wakes up at night at the time that it is very cold, and that you make wudhu and you pray. As for the tareeq or path to the Hellfire may Allaah protect us and you from it, is something that is easy iyaazu billaah. By doing those things that have connections with our desires like zina and drinking khamr and consuming wealth unlawfully and other than that from the evil act. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;Alif Laam Meem, do the people believe that they are going to be left alone saying that we believe and that they will not be put under trial. Indeed we put to trial those who came before them and Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala will know those who were truthful in their Imaan and Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will know by way of those that who are liars &amp;ndash; the kaazibeen.nd likewise Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;do you believe that you are going to enter Jannah and it did not come to you that which came to those who came before you? They were struck with hardships and calamities and they were shook until the Messenger and those who believe along with him said, &#8216;when is the aid of Allaah going to come? Indeed the aid of Allaah is near.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you O my brother Muslim, and you O my sister Muslimah indeed you have chosen al-Islaam as your religion and this is the way of the anbiya alaihissalaatu wassalam and it is upon you that you remain firm upon the religion of Allaah and that you are not shaken in your Imaan and that you are not deceived by the duny and by its beautification and by Allaah you don&#8217;t know when you are going to die. And you don&#8217;t know when that thing that thing that stops all of one&#8217;s desires and stops all of one&#8217;s pain is going to end and going to come, so die while you are upon Islaam and while you are upon Imaan and while being in a state of being distant from the lewd deed and the evil deeds. &#8216;O Allaah make us to see the Haqq and bless us to follow it. O Allaah make us see the baathil and the falsehood and bless us to stay away from it. And do not make it something that is not clear to us, so that we go astray. O Allaah make the best of our deeds of the dunya the last of our deeds, and the best of our action the last of our actions and the last of our days the day that we meet you.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young man, nineteen years of age, and have involved myself in a great deal of sin. Even to the extent that I do not pray most of my Prayers in the mosque, and I have never completely fasted the month of Ramadaan in my entire life. Besides these, I have committed other sins as well. I have vowed to repent many times before, however, after doing so I lapse back into these same sins. The youths of my area are just as bad, as are the friends that I associate with. And Allaah knows that I have transgressed against myself and that whenever I repent, I return back to the same sins. I hope that you may direct me to a path that will bring me closer to my Lord and distance me from these evil actions of mine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: Allaah &#8211; the Might and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Say O My Slaves who have transgressed against their own souls! Do not despair of Allaah&#8217;s mercy. Indeed Allaah forgives all sins, Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:53]. There is a consensus from the Scholars that this noble <i>aayah</i> (verse) was revealed for the <i>taa&#8217;ibeen</i> (those who repent). So whoever sincerely repents from his sins, then Allaah will forgive him all his sins, as occurs in the saving of Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; : <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Turn to Allaah in sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord may remove from you your sins and admit you into Paradise beneath which rivers flow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tahreem 66:8]. So in this <i>aayah</i> (verse), Allaah has made the removal of sins and entry into Paradise dependant upon sincere repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincere repentance is conditional upon: [i] abandoning the sin and keeping away from it, [ii] having regret and remorse for committing the sin, [iii] truly intending not to commit the sin again, [iv] remembering the greatness of Allaah and hoping for His reward, whilst fearing His punishment. Another condition for sincere repentance is that if due to transgression, the wealth or property of someone has been stolen or usurped, then it must be returned or forgiveness must be sought from the one whose wealth, blood or honour has been taken. However, if the honour of a person has been violated and the situation is such that it is not possible to seek that persons forgiveness, then plenty of <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) should be made for his welfare and he should be spoken good of in those places where he had previously been backbitten, since good deeds wipe away bad ones. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Turn you all in repentance to Allaah, O Believers, in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:31]. So in this <i>aayah</i> (verse) Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; linked success with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance) and points to the fact that the repentant person will reach success and happiness, and if such a person were to follow up this repentance with <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and doing righteous actions, then Allaah would efface his evil actions and change them to good actions, as Allaah the Most Perfect &#8211; said after mentioning the sins of Shirk (directing worship that is due only for Allaah to other than Allaah), taking a life without just cause and fornication and adultery-: <b>&#8220;And whoever does this, will receive the punishment, The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgement and he will live therein in disgrace. Except for those who repent, have <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and do righteous actions. For them Allaah will change their evil deeds into good ones, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Furqaan 25:68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the causes of <i>tawbah</i> (repentance) are humility and submissiveness to Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and asking Allaah for guidance and ability, and that acceptance of one&#8217;s repentance is considered as a Favour from Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8216;<b>&#8216;Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60] And He &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And when My servant asks you concerning Me, say to them that I am indeed near, And I respond to the supplication of the one who supplicates to Me.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:186]. Also, from the causes of <i>tawbah</i> is choosing good companionship and friendship and following them in righteous conduct, whilst staying clear of bad companionship. It is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallaallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;A person is upon the way of life of his friend, so let one of you look to whom he keeps as a friend.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallaallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>also said:<i> &#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk, then either he will grant you some, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i>3</p>

<p><span style="text-align:justify;">The </span><i style="text-align:justify;">Nikah</i><span style="text-align:justify;"> is from the ways of Allah with regard to his creation, between the children of Adam, male and female.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With it there are great benefits, from them: chastity of the two spouses, one to the other; to fulfill what is required from the husband towards his wife; the husband taking care of his wife; and protecting her. From it is also the fulfilling of the desires of both sexes and from it is having children. There are many benefits from <i>Nikah</i>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important thing is that it keeps you chaste from adultery, from fornication and the loss of lineage, and from the corruption of moral uprightness. There is the protection of one’s health.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for adultery and fornication then their end place is in epidemics and in lethal illnesses, as is well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><b>وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَسَاءَ سَبِيلًا ٣٢</b><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a <i>Fahishah</i> [i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">[Surah Al-&#8216;Isrā&#8217;:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With it there is the loss of lineage, the spread of illnesses, the loss of modesty and chastity. With it there are great harms; fornication, we seek refuge with Allah, what an evil way. The harms of fornication are not limited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With <i>Nikah</i>, there is a protection from fornication and from its harms, and all praises are due to Allah. <i>Nikah</i> produces offspring. As for fornication then it is a loss. The offspring from fornication have no father and no lineage, and we seek refuge with Allah. Lost&#8230; This is from the disadvantages of fornication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Allah) didn&#8217;t say don&#8217;t fornicate, he said don&#8217;t come close to it, &#8216;don&#8217;t come near to it&#8217;, i.e. stay away from the means that lead to fornication. Such as: looking, the seclusion with a man, the traveling of the woman by herself, her showing off her beauty. These are means that lead to falling into fornication. Allah has not allowed them, he has prohibited them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is leniency in these means then fornication will take place. If there is leniency in these means then fornication will take place, because the desires are present. Desires are present between men and women. If they sat together and mixed then fornication is close. <i>Shaytaan</i> is present, if a man secluded himself with a woman, then <i>shaytaan</i> is the third one amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say you have bad thoughts and that you are pessimists. We are not pessimists, this is the reality. This is the reality and if these means that Allah has prohibited are violated, then fornication will occur, no doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the righteous man, the religious one, there is a danger upon him from the woman. Especially if she was beautiful and he secluded himself with her or traveled with her or she joined him at work. Or if she sat with him in the classroom, or in an exam, or in meetings. Or if she sat with him on the television, or on the radio, as his colleague, i.e. a presenter next to him, and she is beautified and he is a youth. Far is Allah from all imperfections. Do you bring petrol next to fire? Petrol is by itself and the fire is by itself. You bring her next to him! This is like that; no it is worse than petrol and fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires… we seek refuge with Allah, desires are strong. So for this reason Allah (the Exalted, Most High), has placed barriers that prevent falling in to fornication. If they are preserved, fornication is lessened or cut-off. If they are lost, then fornication will occur without a doubt. No matter what, even if they are religious or modest, the children of Adam are not saved from fornication except by the means that prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of zina, which he will inevitably commit. The zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking, one may wish and desire, and the private parts confirm that or deny it.”</span> [al-Bukhaari, 5889; Muslim, 2657]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”</span> [al-Isra’ 17:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)”</span> [al-Noor 24:30-31]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">What is meant by this type of fitnah is the fitnah of the desires which leads to and encourages one to engage in and commit sins or disobedience to Allah.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">This type of fitnah is very dangerous especially in our times because of the fact that this type of fitnah is more appealing and closer to those who have weak souls. Thus, the (weak) individual gives in the first time, then gets drawn in to this type of fitnah and establishes a strong foothold in committing sins. Thus, his iman (faith) weakens or even leaves.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Some examples of this type of fitnah are:<strong> the desire for wealth, immoralities, amusement, food and drink, clothes, and the desire to imitate the kuffar and sinners</strong>. For example, the lust for wealth leads to falling into numerous sins like the bloodshed which emanates between warring countries or between tribes, breaking into people’s homes and businesses or their cars, embezzling people’s money by unlawful means or prohibited means like fraud or selling things which are prohibited.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Lust for immoralities leads to committing unlawful acts like <strong>rape, fornication or adultery, homosexuality, masturbation, luring minors or weak minded individuals into committing inappropriate acts</strong>. It also leads to <strong>watching pornographic channels, videos, on the internet or magazines</strong>. It also leads to harassing or <strong>following women</strong> in shopping malls or with video enhanced networking devices like that are included in mobile phones and computer cameras. In addition to these vices, this type of fitnah leads to lethargy with regards to performing the obligatory actions in addition to leniency with regards to them and even leads to eventually leaving them completely, not performing them at all. An individual may be chaste, have fear of Allah, be religious and then open the door to this type of fitnah and as a result become corrupt and then be destroyed.</p>
