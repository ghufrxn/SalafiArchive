<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know may Allah have mercy upon you! that knowledge is not in merely narrating a great deal and </strong>(having many)<strong> books.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Ash-Shaafi’ee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Knowledge is not what is memorized, but what benefits</strong></span>.” Reported in Hilyatul-Awliyaa’ of Abu Nu’aym (9/123).</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So examine, may Allaah have mercy upon you, the speech of everyone you hear from, in your time in particular; so do not act in haste. And do not enter into anything from it, until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam speak about it or anyone from the scholars? So if you find a narration about it from them, then cling onto it and do not go beyond it for anything and do not give preference to anything over it, and thus fall into the Fire.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/examine-the-speech-of-everyone-you-hear-from-in-your-time-in-particular" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be hasty regarding that which you hear from the people, particularly in later times, and the large number of people who speak and give rulings and who stand to give knowledge and speak. And particularly, with the new development in information media, that it is now the case that everyone talks foolishly and speaks in the name of knowledge and in the name of the Religion, even the people of misguidance and the deviated and the misguided sects. They now speak in the name of the Religion on satellite channels. So the danger is very great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon you O Muslim, and O Student of Knowledge in particular, to verify and that you are not hasty in taking everything that you hear. It is upon you to verify and to be aware, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>who is the one who said this thing? And where did this idea come from? And then what is its basis, and its proofs from the Book and the Sunnah? Then where did this person study and who did he take knowledge from?</strong> </span>So these matters require verification, particularly in this time. So we do not accept every saying that anyone is saying, even if he speaks well, and speaks eloquently, and speaks abundantly and attracts people&#8217;s hearing, do not be taken in by it until you look and see the extent of their knowledge and understanding of the Religion that he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or it may be the case that a person&#8217;s speech may be little, but he is a person of understanding of the Religion. And it might also be the case that a person&#8217;s speech may be plentiful, but he is an ignorant one who has nothing from knowledge and understanding of the Religion. Rather he just has magical/enchanting speech so that he fools the people, and gives the false impression that he is a scholar and that he is a person of understanding and that he is a thinker and the likes of that, so that the people are taken in and he takes them away from the Truth. So what is counted is not the amount of speech and being able to ramble on, rather what is counted is what it contains with regard to knowledge and what it contains with regard to being based upon correct principles. And it may be the case with speech that is little but it is correctly based upon correct principles. This will be far more beneficial than abundant speech which is just lengthy, and from which no benefit can be taken except a little. And this is the situation in our time, where speech is abundant and knowledge is scarce; the recitors are many, and the people of knowledge and understanding (fuqahaa·) are few in number. And fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) does not come about by being able to speak a great deal, or to recite a great deal, or being able to speak well or being able to word things well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Poet said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Embellished (falsely adorned) speech may make its falsehood seem attractive,</em><br />
<em> Whereas the Truth, may suffer as a result of being badly expressed.</em><br />
<em> So you may say, “This is the spittle of the bees” if you want to praise it;</em><br />
<em> but if you wanted you could say, “It is the vomit of flying insects which sting.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you wish to praise honey, you can say, “This is something put out from the mouth of the bee,” but if you want to speak against it, then you can say, “This is vomit,” instead of saying it is ‘spittle’ (something put out from the mouth); and instead of ‘a bee’ you can say ‘a hornet’ (a stinging insect that flies). So the eloquent person, he can turn the Truth into falsehood and falsehood look like the Truth by means of his eloquence, so beware of this. And therefore the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam he warned against the person who is very eloquent in speech, the person who moves his tongue around just as the cows move the tongue around.1 He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) warned against this one and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Some speech is like magic.”</strong> </span>[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning it enchants the people’s hearing (acts like magic upon the hearing of the people). His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So look and examine, may Allaah have mercy upon you, at the speech of everyone whom you hear from in your time in particular. Do not be hasty and do not enter into anything from it.”</strong> </span>This was at the time of the author [03] and the author was almost at the same time as Imaam Ahmad, because he is one of the students of his students. He says: Do not be hasty in accepting the speech of the people in your time, until you verify it. So where is this in comparison to this time of ours now, the time of desires and the time of ignorance and the time when the different parts of the world are all mixed together? To the extent that trials and tribulations and evils and ideas arise and surge like waves and the enemy now wants to turn the Religion upon its head. He wants us to follow him and to impose his ideas upon us and to impose his politics upon us. Therefore it is upon us to check this affair carefully and to withhold from many affairs and to turn attention to seeking to understand the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger, and to acquire knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) contains a protection from trials and tribulations. And al-fiqh means al-fahm (understanding of the Religion). And a person may have memorized a great deal, but he does not have understanding, so therefore he and the common person are just the same. Indeed the common person may be better than him because he withholds himself and he recognizes his own ignorance, while this one does not realise that he is actually an ignorant person. Therefore the matter is not just memorizing a great amount or speaking a great deal. The matter is a matter of fiqh (understanding) and therefore he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “Perhaps one who has something conveyed to him will be better comprehending than the one who heard it (originally).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person may memorize something, and transmit and narrate, and yet there may be someone there who understands it better than he does. (Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There may be a person who conveys knowledge of the Religion but he is not one who comprehends it.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is a carrier of the knowledge and a transmitter of it, however he is not one who has understanding of it. So fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) is a gift from Allaah which Allaah gives to whomever He wishes from His servants. However, if he utilizes it properly and advances it/causes it to grow then he will benefit from it. But if he neglects it, it will be lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So do not be hasty and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and look: Did anyone from the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam speak with it?”</strong></span> This is a tremendous piece of advice if some speech pleases you regarding the Religion. As for speech about the affairs of this world, then that is not the topic under discussion here. Rather if some speech with regard to the Religion seems pleasing to you then don&#8217;t be hasty until you examine it: Is it founded upon something true and upon proof or is it just from the person&#8217;s own head and his own thinking? For if it is, then it is just scum, like the scum which is carried on the top of flood water. Leave it (in that case). But otherwise if it is founded and based upon the Book and the Sunnah, then it is true. So therefore to do not be hasty in taking speech without restraint, even if it seems pleasing to you in its fine manner of speaking and it is eloquence and its forcefulness and in the style of address, do not be hasty about it until you examine and you test it against the Book and the Sunnah, and examine and see who said it. Is he a person of knowledge and understanding (a faqeeh) or not a person of knowledge and understanding? Until you ask the people of knowledge about it (this matter) and you look and see, did anyone from the Salaf (Predecessors) say it or did they not say it? And this is something I have warned against many times, that I say: Do not introduce personal deductions and opinions and sayings and wording which have not been preceded upon. Take as your example the Salaf and the speech of the Salaf, and if you bring something which you have no one who precedes you upon it, then it will be something odd and strange, and its danger will be far more than its benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of the Companions is the balance because they were the students of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Their sayings are looked to with regard to an aayah; how did they explain it? And with regard to a hadeeth, how did they explain it? So you take from their sayings and from their explanation because they will be closer to the Truth than anyone who came after them; because they were students of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they heard the interpretation and the explanation from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they took knowledge directly from him, so they will be the people who are closest to the Truth. And no weight is to be given, to the saying of those people who say, “The Companions are not to be counted, they were men and they had their own opinions, and we are men and we have our thoughts. Times change.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion remains and will remain until the Hour is established. And it does not change with the changing time; it covers every time and place. What changes is only human deductions, which may sometimes be wrong and sometimes correct. As for the Religion itself, it does not change because it is suitable for every time and every place because it was sent down from One who is all wise, deserving of all praise. And therefore they used to advise and say, “Adhere to the Book and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Pious Predecessors. Do not introduce an understanding from yourself or from the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“or anyone from the People of Knowledge (scholars)”</strong></span> Meaning, did anyone from the scholars who are counted say it, from the Imaams who proceeded upon the way of the Companions of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Because they were the ones who narrated from the Companions, and the Companions were the ones who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So if you find a narration from them about it, then cling onto it.”</span></strong> If you find it being in agreement with their saying then cling onto it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And do not go beyond it for anything.”</span></strong> And do not go beyond the speech of the Salaf for the opinion of so and so, and so and so from those who came after them. His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And do not prefer anything over and above it and thus fall into the Fire.”</strong></span> And do not prefer over what came from the Salaf anything, from that which the later people brought such that you fall into the Fire. Because you have gone against the path leading to Paradise, and the path of Paradise is what (they) were upon, those who&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Those whom Allah has bestowed favor upon, from the Prophets, and the true and truthful followers of the Prophet, and the martyrs, and the righteous people and what a fine companionship they are.&#8221; </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the path to Paradise, and whatever conflicts with it is a path leading to the Fire. And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path so follow it, and do not follow the multiple paths, for they will cause you to split away from His path”</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s path is one but as for other than it, then it is many paths. Every devil has a path and he has a path; on each path there will be devils from mankind and from the jinn. So they are many different paths which will throw the person who follows them into confusion. But as for the Straight Path, then it is one. It does not contain any disagreement and you will never become lost if you follow it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Concerning matters of the Religion, Muslims should verify:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Who has said this thing?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Where did it come from?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is its basis in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Did any of the Salaf say it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If it is just from a person’s own head and own thinking then leave it</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the person who spoke about this matter, Muslims should verify:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Where did he study?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whom did he take knowledge from?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The extent of his knowledge and understanding</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It may be that a person speaks little, yet he is a person of understanding of the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It may be that a person speaks plentifully yet he has no knowledge and understanding of the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">In our time:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Speech is abundant and knowledge is scarce;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The recitors are many and the people of knowledge and understanding are few</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The eloquent one can make the Truth look like falsehood and make falsehood like look the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allaah hates those men who are eloquent, the one who moves his tongue around, just as the cow moves its tongue around. (hadeeth)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) warned against this one saying, “Some speech is like magic.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us to:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Check affairs carefully,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Withhold from many affairs</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Turn to seeking to understand the Qur·aan and the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Acquire knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge and understanding of the Religion contains a protection from trials and tribulations</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A common person may be better than one who has memorized a lot because he recognizes his own ignorance</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There may be a person who conveys knowledge of the Religion but he is not one who comprehends it.” (hadeeth)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Fiqh, knowledge and understanding of the Religion, is a gift from Allaah
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If a person utilizes this gift properly and advances it he will benefit from it</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If he neglects it, it will be lost</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Do not introduce personal deductions, opinions, sayings and wording which have not been preceded upon</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The danger of bringing something which has not been preceded upon is more than its benefit.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Take as your example the Salaf and the speech of the Salaf</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Companions took knowledge directly from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, so they will be the people who are closest to the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Straight Path is one and you will never become lost if you follow it</li>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Interview with Umm ‘Abdullaah Wife of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Interview conducted by Sis. Maha bint Husein Ash-Shammari &amp; Published in &#8220;Al-Mutamayyizah&#8221; Magazine; Issue No. 45, Ramadhan, 1427. Confirmed &amp; Presented in English by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh. Transcribed from the audio presentation by Br. Abu Abdullah Al-Amreeki, Reviewed and finalized by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh January 7, 2007</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is an interview with Umm ‘Abdullaah, the wife of our Shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saleh al-‘Uthaimeen (رحمه الله : rahimahullaah). The interview was conducted by Sis. Maha bint Husein Ash-Shammari &amp; Published in &#8220;AlMutamayyizah Magazine,&#8221; Riyadh, KSA; Issue No. 45, Ramadhan, 1427.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 1: Was there any change in the motivation of the Shaykh regarding ‘ilm (knowledge), dawah, and worship between his youth and his elder years?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I did not find any diminishing or weakness in his motivation (رحمه الله ) in knowledge, dawah, and worship despite his progress in age. On the contrary, his busy schedule continued to increase with time, as was the case with his worship and call to the extent that during his intense illness, he (رحمه الله ) was not negligent with one moment; he would spend every second in remembrance of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), worshipping Him, teaching, or directing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 2: What did you see that was amazing in the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) life?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His life was an example to follow, especially his patience and motivation to seek the knowledge as well as teach and dissipate it. Also, his piety (رحمه الله ) was something that those who were not close to him may not have known about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 3: How did the Shaykh interact with his children in their private lives?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>s: His dealings with his sons and daughters fell into two stages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, in their childhood, he (رحمه الله ) was keen to be close to them, take care of them, raise some of the Islamic principles in them, and follow their educational achievements. In addition, he made sure to direct, admonish, and incite them. For instance, he would sometimes take the children with him to the masjid to perform some of the fard prayers. Also, he would encourage them to fast some of the days of Ramadan. Furthermore, he would incite them to memorize some of the short surahs of the Qur’aan and reward them on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the stage of youth and maturity, he (رحمه الله ) was firm concerning their fulfilling of the religious obligations and in discipline in cases of negligence. He would couple that with direction and leniency. At certain times, he was not hesitant to do what was sufficient to change or correct their mistakes. In addition, he (رحمه الله ) used to put full trust in them to do certain things so they could learn to depend upon themselves; he used to continuously encourage them on righteousness and check on them regarding that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 4: Why did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) not use henna on his beard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Maybe he did not have the time to do that. I think I heard him saying something to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 5: When did the Shaykh anger intensify, and how did he deal with your anger?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His anger used to intensify if the inviolable matters of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) were violated. Regarding my anger with the children, he would try to calm me down first and then give the admonition to the one that was mistaken. In general, he (رحمه الله ) was quiet and did not anger quickly; when he (رحمه الله ) did, his anger would quickly dissipate, and this is from the favors of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) upon him, something which I wished for the like of his condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 6: How did he (رحمه الله ) get up from his sleep? Did he depend on an alarm clock, or would he ask someone to wake him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to depend upon Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), then the alarm clock and then us. Usually he awoke before the alarm and before I would go to wake him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 7: Would the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) ever go outside with his family for a picnic?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, the family used to have a weekly picnic on Fridays after salaat aljumu’ah; we would go to an area in the wilderness close by and bring our lunch. He utilized this time to share in some activities with the children, like foot racing and solving puzzles. Also, he would bring a small rifle and compete with his children in aiming and shooting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 8: How did the Shaykh fast during the year?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) consistently fasted three days each month throughout his life. In addition, he would fast six days in Shawwal, the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and the day of ‘Aashooraa’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 9: How did the Shaykh select the names of his children?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to choose names like ‘Abdullaah and ‘Abd ar-Rahman [1]; he left the rest for consultation amongst us. We would pick a name and present it to him; he would either agree or ask us to select another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 10: What were some of the things that would please the Shaykh (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: There is no doubt that the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) happiness used to increase whenever he saw the strength of Islam and Muslims. Regarding happiness at home, it was manifested in meetings with his family and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You would also see the signs of pleasure and happiness on him upon receiving his grandchildren. He used to open his cloak to allow them to enter underneath and then inquire about them a few times before reopening it; he would do this several times. Later, he would take them to his library where he kept a special kind of sweets they used to call “halawat abooye” (my father’s sweets). We were keen to ensure that they would not find it, except with him. In addition, despite his busy schedule, he made sure to visit his grandchildren at their homes or in the hospital if any of them were ill; this would have a great influence on them and their patents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 11: How many children did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) have?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh had five sons and three daughters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 12: Who amongst his children was the closest to his heart?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh used to deal justly with his children in all affairs, major and minor. If he found any kind of distinction between them, he would never declare it openly because this is not from justice. If he was keen to be just in matters lighter than this, then what should we expect here?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 13: Who amongst his children was most affected by his death?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: All of them were, and the reality of the matter is that I used to feel that we were not alone in this as he was a father to Muslims around the world, who all felt a great shock by his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 14: Who is his youngest child?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The youngest is a daughter who is 21 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 15: What were the steps the Shaykh took in seeking knowledge, and what was your role in that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) began teaching in the Grand Mosque in Unayzah following the death of his Shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Naasir as-Saa’di (رحمه الله ) even before I married him. At that time, he used to consider himself a student of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning my assistance, it was manifested in not distracting him from seeking knowledge and propagating it. I used to serve and make available to him what would support his efforts. I would also follow the children and take care of them, except in matters that required his notification so that he could direct, admonish, and seek a solution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 16: How did he reconcile between the dawah, which took most of his time, and his familial and social responsibilities?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to organize his time and gave this great attention. For instance, he would dedicate time for teaching, fatawa, dawah, worship, the family, the children, social responsibilities, and upholding the ties of kinship. If he, at certain times, was unable to directly share in some of these responsibilities, he was still keen to share even by phone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 17: What was his policy regarding educating and directing his children?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His policy was education; however, he did not force his children to seek a specialty but instead used to consult with them regarding this decision. The obvious proof is that his children graduated from different types of colleges, some sharee’, others military, and also educational.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 18: Taking into consideration the Shaykh’s work and commitments, this inevitably led to him being away from home and the family. What was your role regarding this matter, and how did you cover for his absence (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Even if he was away from home whether for teaching and propagating inside Unayzah or while traveling, he used to follow up with his children through phone calls and by checking on their affairs upon his return. My role is not even worth mentioning because we always felt his presence with us. In general, I used to make the children feel their father’s responsibilities were great and his works many. As such, I would incite them to be patient on that, and he (رحمه الله ) used to compensate them on his return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 19: Could you tell us about his worship at home?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was keen to perform the as-sunan ar-rawatib (regular sunnah prayers), except in limited circumstances. He (رحمه الله ) used to wake up in the latter part of the night as much as possible and then make the witr before fajr, in addition to the remembrances and istighfar that he did not discontinue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 20: What was his daily program? For example, when did he sleep and wake, and when did he eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh used to get up in the last third of the night, praying as much as Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) wished and then make the witr before the adhan of fajr. Following the adhan, he would pray the regular sunnah of fajr. Next, he would wake his family before going to perform salaat al-fajr at the masjid. He would then return home to read his daily remembrances in the courtyard as well as some of the Qur’aan until about sunrise. He would then sleep till about 8 am. This was on the days that he was not teaching at the university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After waking again, he would eat some breakfast and then finish his work and readings in his study. He would also pray salaat ad-duhaa before going to the masjid for salaat adh-dhuhr. Upon his return, he would eat lunch with his family at about 1:30. Next, he would take phone calls until about 20 minutes before ‘asr. He would then rest for fifteen minutes or less before going to the masjid to pray ‘asr and meet the needs of people who went to the masjid knowing he would be there. He would return to his study after addressing the people’s needs to read before going again to the masjid for maghrib and his daily classes that would last until isha. Usually he would return home after that to eat a light dinner before going to his study to either give lectures outside of the Kingdom via telelink or hold meetings. This was almost his regular schedule throughout most the year, although it would change during some seasons such as Ramadan, Hajj, and the summer break.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were also some weekly commitments, and these would take place either at home or outside. Some of his weekly commitments included: Wednesday night meetings with the judges, meetings with the imaams that were scheduled to give the khutbah of jumu’ah in the masajid, meetings with university staff and professors, and meetings with the people of hisbah (those that enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong) until 11 or 12 pm then he would go to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 21: What was his schedule during Ramadan, especially after iftaar?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: During Ramadan, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) had a different schedule. He would spend most of the time at the masjid reciting Qur’aan and meeting the needs of the people. Also, he would invite some of the students of knowledge and the poor to eat iftaar at our home. After salaat al-isha, he would return home for dinner and to give fatawa over the phone. In addition, many people would visit our house to either say salaam to the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) or seek a fatwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 22: Where did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) like to spend his rest time?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: In reality, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not know rest time; all of his time was busy. Even when he was sitting with us, the phone sometimes would ring, and he would spend a long time addressing the call. His rest time was in propagating the knowledge, meeting people’s needs, and fatawa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 23: How many hours a day did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) sleep?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The connected time did not exceed 3 to 4 hours. In total, it did not exceed 6 hours daily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 24: Who amongst the students of the Shaykh did he praise, mention often, and was pleased with their visits?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) looked the same upon all of his students. All of them were like his sons, and he did not praise any of them in particular, but he looked upon them equally when he would meet or welcome them to the house. Also, he would share in their special occasions, meetings, trips, or support them if they were in need of something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 25: How did the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) family deal with his asceticism and piety?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to see him (رحمه الله ) as an example in all things, and we used to revere his asceticism and piety, which would comfort us since he (رحمه الله ) did not like any unnatural mannerisms nor did he want that around him. He was a simple person who liked ease in all of his matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 26: Did he (رحمه الله ) cry upon the death of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baaz (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was greatly affected by the death of his Shaykh, from whom he took knowledge. Everyone around him felt the extent of the profound impact it had. May Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) make us meet them all in the Paradise of bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 27: Did he travel for other than seeking knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, he did not travel except to seek knowledge. He used to travel to Makkah for ‘Umrah, where he would dedicate times for duroos (talks). In addition, he went to Riyadh and Ta’if to attend the meetings of the Grand Scholars Committee, where he would also schedule duroos and lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 28: Can you tell us about the apparent generosity of the Shaykh with those in need?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to feel his care (رحمه الله ) for the people in need, whether they were distant or close. For instance, he used to check on the affairs of his family and relatives that were in need. Also, he would do the same with his neighbors, helping them in all that they needed, comforting them concerning their worries, and sharing in their joyous occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 29: What did you learn from the Shaykh? Did you learn matters of fatawa? Did you ever give fatawa?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I learned from the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) everything that relates to the affairs of this life, whether from the social or legal aspects. Concerning giving fatawa, I would not even dare to do this. I only used to present the Questions I received to him and then relate the Answers and fatawa to those that had asked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 30: Before the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) death, what did he admonish his household and beloved ones with?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not give a specific direction before his death, but throughout his life, he would direct everyone to that which benefited them in their life and in their deen (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 31: We would like an admonition from you to the wives of the callers and students of knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: They should preserve their husbands, openly and secretly. In addition, they should prepare for them the best situations and conditions to continue providing their duties of dawah and knowledge. Also, I incite them that they should not be bothered by the busy schedule of their husbands and their time spent traveling, seeking knowledge, reading, and doing dawah. By Allaah’s (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) Will, they are sharing in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 32: Could you tell us about the way the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) used to receive his guests?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) would receive his guests with simplicity and a real sense of welcoming. He ensured that they felt like guests, and no day passed, except that he brought a guest either for lunch, dinner or in between. We were pleased with his guests and would honor them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 33: What about a rare and pleasing encounter he had with his children or neighbours?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) acted with simplicity towards his children and neighbors and all those surrounding him. And one of those rare and nice occasions is that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) used to record some short recitations and nasheed [2] for his children and sometimes in the presence of one of the neighbors&#8217; kids. He then would re-play the cassette to them during some meeting with them at older ages. We even still keep some of these recording to this date.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 34: What is your advice to those that spread mischief in our Kingdom?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to preserve our land and to continue to bestow upon us the favor of security and safety. The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) would often repeat and mention that he does not know any nation on the face of the earth that applies the sharee’ah and holds to the correct creed like this one. Similarly, he (رحمه الله ) used to incite us to deal with affairs using wisdom, good admonition, and leniency instead of resorting to violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 35: Is there anything that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) asked you to do that seemed strange and made you feel hesitant?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It may be unknown to most that I was illiterate and did not receive any kind of formal education. When I first married the Shaykh (رحمه الله ), I was fully busy in his service and in providing him the correct, comfortable environment to seek knowledge and teach. After we had our children, I was busy with them, and it took all my time to raise them, in addition to the time I used to spend to help and support the Shaykh ( rahimahullaah) in seeking knowledge. After the children grew up and my responsibilities began to ease slightly, I was surprised that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) began to incite me to join the schools for the elderly. Although hesitant at first, I decided to join. During this period, he followed my achievements and would not accept for any of my sons to sign my transcripts of record. He (رحمه الله ) would say, “I am the one to sign for all that relates to your academic achievements.” This moment of learning is a period that can not be forgotten because of the great, innumerable benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 36: What kinds of gifts would the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) give you, his children, and people in general?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: During his lifetime, he (رحمه الله ) would not withhold anything from those that were close and those that were distant, to the best of his ability. The greatest gift he used to give us was his dawah and du’aa; I ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to accept his du’aa, hold them for him in his good record, and bestow upon us the ability to be righteous to him after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 37: Did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) relate to you anything nice that occurred in the masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) would always tell us those things that he thought were fit to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 38: When did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) travel for dawah, and how would you deal with him concerning that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I used to incite and encourage him as well as make things easy for him by providing him what he needed. In general, his trips were few, and I used to join him on most of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning travel outside of the Kingdom, he did not leave the country, except to seek treatment in America for ten days, and I joined him during that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 39: Could you tell us about the Shaykh’s use of the internet when it was first introduced to the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was one of the earliest to hasten to benefit from this service and tried to utilize it to dissipate, propagate, and serve the Islamic knowledge. There is nothing more evident of this than the establishment of his website, which contains all of his works. His site is currently supervised by the charitable organization that was setup after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 40: When did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) buy the automatic, telephone <strong>Answer</strong>ing machine?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: From the things that are unknown to many is that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) was keen and had interest in modern electronic instruments. There were those that used to provide him with the newest technology, such that you would often find with him some electronics that had not yet been released to the open market; examples include: electronic watches, instruments that could determine the direction of the qiblah, audio recording devices, mobile phones, and automatic telephone Answering machines among many other gadgets. He (رحمه الله ) acquired the automatic Answering machine as soon as it became available in the Kingdom. He used it a great deal, often programming it and recording the messages himself, to the extent that when he would travel, he would leave a detailed message on how to contact him while he was away. He was in that, a reference to all of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 41: Did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) buy newspapers, and how did he learn about local and national news?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to receive one of the newspapers at our home as a gift, and he ( rahimahullaah) would look at it if he had time. Sometimes he would ask us for scissors to clip out important articles or news so he could keep it. Also, he would hear the news on the radio, especially during breakfast around 7 or 8 in the morning when he would listen to either the Qur’aan broadcasting station from Riyadh or the BBC. In addition, he would listen sometimes at length to the analysis of the news if there were important developments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 42: Was there ever an offer for the Shaykh to move to Riyadh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Several times he was asked to move to Riyadh, Madinah, and Makkah. He was even assigned as a judge in the eastern province of al-Ihsaa, but he used to see that his staying in Unayzah had a great benefit, so he (رحمه الله ) refused these offers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 43: During the visits of King Faisal (رحمه الله ), King Khaled (رحمه الله ), King Fahad (رحمه الله ), and other princes, what did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) offer them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: When he was at his home which is made of mud in Unayzah, he was visited by King Saud (رحمه الله ), King Khaled (رحمه الله ), and King Fahad (رحمه الله ); they were amazed by his humbleness, piety, simplicity, and asceticism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 44: Did anyone offer to install any echo instruments for the microphone in the Shaykh’s masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not see to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 45: Was the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) married to anyone else other than you, and how many wives did he have?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) was not married to other than me. He married two wives before me; his first wife died, and Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not intend for the second marriage to continue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 46: We need from you an admonition to men who have more than one wife. </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Justice. Justice. Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 47: If one would ask the father (i.e. the Shaykh) to admonish me as a girl, what would you expect him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He would admonish you as he would admonish one of his daughters and all of the daughters of the Muslims to fear Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) openly and secretly, to be righteous to the parents, uphold the ties of kinship, preserve the husband, and fear Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) regarding raising the children Islamically based on leniency and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 48: Did the Shyakh (رحمه الله ) use to tell you about the Mujaahideen in Sheeshaan (Chechnya) and other places especially since it reached us that he was keen concerning their news and Fatwa?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) was keen on following the status (affairs) of Muslims everywhere, in Palestine, Algeria, Afghanistaan, and Sheeshaan. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 49: How did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) receive the news of his illness, and how did he tell you about it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) received the news with patience, anticipating the reward. One of my sons reported to me that after they (رحمه الله ) received the news, he instructed them not to mention anything to their brothers, sisters, or me and that the matter should be left to him. He (رحمه الله ) related the news to us gradually. We ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to forgive him and give him a spacious residence in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 50: We came to know that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) during his illness refused to call his cancer the “evil disease,” choosing instead to simply refer to it as dangerous. Would you tell us about this and his patience?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: This was not only after his illness, but rather he had this opinion before because he disliked using the term “evil” for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his patience, this was manifested in his illness, and I knew that he suffered greatly from it. The pain would wake him many times during the night; whenever he was asked about it, he would confirm that it existed, adding that he only told them this as information and not as a complaint, since he (رحمه الله ) knew the reward for those that were patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] These are the names of two of his sons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[2] The Shyakh&#8217;s (rahimahullaah) position on the so-called Islamic Nasheeds as posted on the site (www.understand-islam.net) is not to be confused with this innocent children-directed recordings referred to here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[3] It is known that the Shaykh (rahimahullaah) like the other reliable scholars of our times, al-Albani and Bin Baaz (rahimahumullaah), as well as Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (hafidhahullaah), exerted great efforts to correctly direct the Muslims in these countries and in others as well as to the reality and conditions of Jihaad and warned them from deviation as evident in their published fatawaa and advices.

<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim<br />
Translation Verified By: Abu Bilal Nahim</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Murtaza bIn Bakhsh:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is upon the truth and who is upon falsehood? How will we know this and how will we be able to distinguish this? Is it possible without knowledge? Then, when will we seek knowledge? Is it not important that time be allocated? It is important; and knowledge is sought from the scholars. It is notjust sought from books. It is sought from scholars and students of knowledge. Those scholars who teach the Qur’aan and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf of this Ummah &#8211; this confinement is obligatory, that there is the Quraan, authentic Hadeeth and they speak, teach the religion and give rulings according to the understanding of the Sahaabah (companions of Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you find such a scholar or such a student of knowledge somewhere, then do not leave him; and connect with the scholars, the senior scholars all praise be to Allaah &#8211; such scholars are present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now (seeking) knowledge has become easy, translations have come forth &#8211; in English, in Urdu, in every language. Shaykh bin Baaz rahimahullaah, Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen, (the) Muhaddith, Muhammad Naasiruddeen aI-Albaani rahimahullaah, there are (about) 10,000 cassettes of his &#8211; now we have CDs, but before the CDs there were (about) 10,000 cassettes. And if you just take out any cassette from the middle, you will notice that they contained the lessons of Tawheed and the Manhaj of the Salaf, in each of his cassettes. Far removed is Allah from all imperfections!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan is alive [hafidhahullaah], Shaykh Saalih al-Luhaydaan is alive, Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree, Shaykh Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee aI-Madkhalee &#8211; they are those ‘Ulemaa, that if you attach yourself to them, by Allaah, life changes. There is light [of guidance] in their sayings; there is light in their guidance. If (you) want to learn the methodology of the Salaf, then this is the path, this is the methodology. There are other Salafee scholars as well but I remember these names, their names are known and famous. Do not say that I do not have a way to reach them. By Allaah, by sitting at home, nowadays, all praise be to Allaah, there are online duroos happening as well. Aren’t they happening? Use this technology correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People abuse it by listening to songs and what not. You use it correctly and see how you become a part of (seeking) beneficial knowledge and how it benefits you even after your death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>A Clarification of the Death of Shaikh Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi’ee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on the one who was sent as a mercy and guidance, and on his Companions and family. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“<span style="color:#008000;">Every soul shall taste death</span>.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“<span style="color:#008000;">Every one on it (the earth) will perish, and the Face of your Lord will remain, possessing glory and honor</span>.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we console ourselves and all the Muslims, in general, and Ahl-us-Sunnah in particular, upon news of the death of the Supporter of the Sunnah and the Subduer of Innovations and Partisanship, the Muhaddith of the world during his time, the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil Ibn Haadee Ibn Muqbil Al-Waadi’ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His death occurred while he was in the city of <strong>Jeddah</strong> at 8:30 pm on Sunday night, the 2nd of Jumaadaa Al-Oolaa <strong>1422H</strong>. He was close to <strong>seventy years</strong> of age at the time of his death, which came as a result of a liver disease that he was suffering from for more than seven years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Janaazah (funeral) prayer was held in <strong>Masjid Al-Haraam</strong> after the Fajr Prayer on Sunday (morning), and he was buried in the <strong>Al-‘Adl graveyard in Makkah</strong> next to the two noble shaikhs, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn Baaz and Muhamamd Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on all of them. This was in accordance with his final request, which he made while on his sickbed in Germany.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to forgive him and to raise his status to the level of those who guide. Indeed to Allaah we belong and indeed to Him we will return. And there is no might nor power except by the Will of Allaah, the Most High, Most Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave him the joy and satisfaction during his life of seeing the effects of his da’wah (call), which were witnessed and felt. But the enemies of the da’wah should not feel happy at news of his death, for he has left behind for them that which will grieve and displease them, such as his scholarly students, his precious books, his widely distributed tapes and his pure methodology, which had no obscurities in it. So he enjoyed the bounties that Allaah bestowed on him. Likewise, he established the foundation for the lofty palace and strong fortress of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we hope from Allaah that He cause his reward to remain continuous as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Whoever calls towards an act of guidance, he will have the same reward as those who follow him (in that act of guidance), and that will not detract anything from their good deeds.”</b></span> Reported in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“When the Son of Aadam dies, his good deeds come to an end except three: a continuously recurring charity, knowledge from which benefit is derived, and a righteous child that supplicates for him.”</b> </span>Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, spent his whole life in <strong>(seeking) knowledge, teaching, writing and calling to Allaah</strong>. This is such that the flatlands and the mountain areas became filled with his students, his books and his tapes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even in his last days, he still was still being asked religious questions on Hadeeth, Fiqh, Shawaahid and ‘Iraab. He was stricken with unconsciousness and then when he recovered and awoke, he was asked questions. From his last words were those that he uttered when he phoned us during his sickness while in Germany. And we asked about the hadeeth of Anas (radhi Allaahu anhu): <b>“O Hayy (Living), O Qayyoom (Eternal), By your mercy we ask for your help.”</b> – “Did you mention it in (your book) As-Saheeh Al-Musnad with this wording?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we cannot forget to give the good tidings to all of our Muslim brothers that this educational center (in Dammaaj) will continue, <i>inshAllaah</i>, as it was during the life of our Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him. So the classes are active and continuing and the affairs are going according to the plans of our Shaikh, by Allaah’s granting that for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh had some final requests for his students, loved ones and brothers from Ahl-us-Sunnah in his handwriting, which will be distributed in these blessed pages, by Allaah’s permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so that our brothers across the various Islaamic lands and those who constantly ask about the future of this center can be at rest and tranquility. So we say: Be calm for the matters are going according to the best way, and the da’wah is preserved from our Lord. So pay no mind to those who spread false rumors and reports. And Allaah is sufficient for us and He is the best of guardians.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee and Shaikh Abdur-Razaaq, may Allaah preserve them, undertook a visit to the area of Qaseem, particularly the city of Buraydah (in Saudi Arabia), some years ago to give a lectures there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But they were met by some people of desires – especially from the Qutubees and Hizbees in the audience who did not want to listen to the Remembrance of Allaah nor to the Call to Tawheed and the following of the correct Manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To hear what happened to the Shaikhs and how the ignorant people dealt with them, listen to the recording, and follow with the summarization below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The program begins with the chair of the conference introducing the topic of the lecture, which was a talk on the hadeeth: <b>“The Religion is Sincerity.”</b> He began with the Shaikh on the right who was Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq, the son of ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad, may Allaah preserve them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh began with Khutbat ul-Haajah, but was not even halfway through it when commotion broke out at the hands of some deviants amongst the followers of vain desires, who started shouting and screaming. But this was quelled and the Shaikh continued by making du’aa that Allaah grant the Muslims Paradise and that He make them people who fear Allaah and act righteously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the commotion continued for a while, but finally the Shaikh began the lecture and the microphone was passed onto Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To whoever came to this masjid and saw fit to do these kinds of actions, which Allaah is not pleased with, will they not fear Allaah? Whoever wants to listen then let him come and whoever wants to leave then let him leave.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq began the lecture and began explaining the hadeeth of <b>“The Religion is Sincerity (Naseeha).”</b> And he stressed the point that what they came to the masjid for was to seek to get closer to Allaah by way of listening and benefiting by the hadeeth of Allaah’s Messenger. And he narrated to them a story about Allaah’s Messenger and Mu’awiyah, which showed that gathering in the masjid is for the purpose of getting closer to Allaah. So this is what they were there for – to worship Allaah and not cause commotion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began by saying what he will talk about in the lecture – the foundation of sincerity and faith in Allaah. So he discussed the definition of Eemaan and went on to mention the three categories of Tawheed, but noise could still be heard in the background from the troublemakers</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq finished and the mic was given to Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee who addressed the troublemakers and asked them if Allaah was pleased with the actions they were doing, at which they again turned violent. And commotion broke loose again, with Shaikh Saalih commanding them to fear Allaah. And the situation got worse with the mob storming the podium and in the midst of all that the Shuyookh were making du’aa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the course of this violent attack, they trampled over the mushafs (copies of Qur’aan) and broke Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee’s walking cane, since he is blind and needs it to walk!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah protected the two Shaikhs from the evil of these people of desires and misguidance! And all of this was just because the Shaikhs stick to the truth and call to the Salafee Manhaj while opposing and refuting the deviants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise the brothers to listen to the recording so that they can see for themselves the condition of these people, who fight against the Salafee Scholars and hate the Salafee Da’wah, only because they have no other recourse since their da’wah is dead and they are void of any proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we cannot forget also what happened to Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who was attacked while giving a lecture in the Masjid of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-‘Ubaylaan years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Access the recording and follow with brief summarization below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Shaikh was in the masjid answering questions, he responded to one question, which consisted of several parts. The first part asked as to the reason why the Muslims are divided into groups, parties and sects. So the Shaikh responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reason is well known – it is something that is going on now, which is the presence of those who incite the people upon political agitation and the presence of those who distribute them into groups. Rather, it is due to these newly invented groups. The groups that are present in the arena nowadays, I consider them to be innovated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since before this state (of Saudi Arabia) was established, you did not find all of these groups – there was only One Group. The Saudi Society was only one Jamaa’ah (group) – the Jamaa’ah of the Muslims. There was no other group to be found besides it. <b>So the presence of all these groups (nowadays) and the efforts these groups expend in calling the people to their manhaj is the cause for them being divided and split up</b>…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one man from the audience began to criticize the Shaikh’s response about the jamaa’aat (groups) and commotion broke loose, with a mob shouting and screaming. And all the while the Shaikh was trying to calm the mob down, seeking refuge in Allaah, but they did not listen to him. Even to the point that the Call for Prayer was proclaimed and they did not listen to that! Rather, the prayer was started and commotion and screaming could still be heard from those who wished to cause fitnah and disrespect the house of Allaah, may Allaah guide these individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of all of the scholars who have followed the Way of the Salaf, in that they were faced with the opposition of the deviants – even to the point where their opposition was violent, as was the case with Imaam Abu Shaamah, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, the great scholar of the 7th Century, who wrote a tremendous book [<b>Al-Bid’i wal-Hawaadith</b>] refuting the present day innovations of his time, as he was beaten to the point that he never fully recovered from his injuries and eventually died later from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to protect our scholars and to grant them a long lifespan for benefiting the ummah, Amaeen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part I)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/527-530), in explanation of the saying of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa &#8211; :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Stones will soon fall upon you from the sky. I say: Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said…, and you say: Aboo Bakr and `Umar said!”</span> :-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…This saying from Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – was a response to those who said to him: &#8220;Aboo Bakr and `Umar &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhumaa – did not hold joining the `Umrah along with the Hajj (at-tamattu`), and they held that performing Hajj on its own (al-Ifraad) is better‟, or the like of that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, it was because of this that Ibn `Abbaas said, when they countered the Hadeeth with the opinion of Aboo Bakr and `Umar -: “Stones are about to fall upon you from the sky…” – the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee</strong> – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The scholars are agreed, by consensus, that whoever is such that the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) becomes clear to him, then it is not for him to leave it for the saying of anyone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam Maalik</strong> – rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is none of us except that he rebuts and is rebutted, except for the occupant of this grave (صلى الله عليه وسلم)”,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the speech of the imaams with this meaning is abundant…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…So the speech of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – shows that whoever receives a textual proof, and he does not accept it, because of taqleed (blind-following) of his imaam, then it is obligatory to criticize him severely, because of his opposing the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ahmad said: “Ahmad ibn `Umar al-Bazzaar narrated to us: Ziyaad ibn Ayyoob narrated to us: Aboo `Ubaydah al-Haddaad narrated to us: from Maalik ibn Deenaar: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is not one of us except that some of his sayings are taken, and some are left; except for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore it is obligatory to criticise whoever leaves the proof in favour of anyone from the scholars, no matter who that is. The recorded sayings of the imaams clearly state this; and state that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘taqleed’ (blind-following) is not allowable except in matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction) for which no proof is found in the Book or the Sunnah</strong></span>. So this is what some of the scholars meant by their saying: <em>‘There is to be no criticism in the matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction).’</em> As for the one who acts contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to refute him; just as was said by Ibn `Abbaas, ash-Shaafi`ee, Maalik, and Ahmad – and this is something agreed upon, as has preceded in the speech of Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part II)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/532), in explanation of the saying of Imaam Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity, and yet they hold on to the opinion of Sufyaan, whereas Allaah – the Most High – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So let those who oppose the Messenger‟s command beware, lest a fitnah (affliction) befalls him, or a painful torment be inflicted upon him</span>.[Sooratun-Noor (24):63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know what the affliction is? The affliction is <strong>Shirk</strong>. Perhaps if he rejects something from his saying, some deviation will fall into his heart and he is destroyed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the saying of Imaam Ahmad – rahimahullaah – “I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity…” is a criticism from him of that; and shows that it leads to deviation of the hearts, which causes a person to become a Disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">So this evil has become extremely widespread, particularly amongst those who claim attachment to knowledge. They do whatever they can to prevent people from acting upon the Book and the Sunnah; and they block people from following the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and from honouring and respecting his commands and prohibitions. So from that is their saying: &#8220;No one except a &#8220;mujtahid‟ can use the Book and the Sunnah as proof, and &#8220;ijtihaad‟ has ended‟, and the saying: &#8220;This person who I am blindly following knows better than you do about hadeeth, and about the abrogating and abrogated narrations‟, and the like of these sayings, whose goal is just the abandonment of following of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم): he who does not speak from his own desires, in favour of dependence upon sayings of those who can err, and who is contradicted by other imaams and whose saying can be nullified by a textual proof. So there is not an imaam except that he only possessed a portion of knowledge; he did not possess all of it. So what is obligatory upon every legally responsible person, when a proof from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches him, and he understands its meaning, is that he accepts it and acts upon it, no matter who contradicts it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and do not take others besides Him: obeying them in disobedience to Him. Little do you remember!</span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is it not sufficient for them that We sent down to you this Book which is recited to them?! In it there is mercy and a reminder for those who believe in it</span> [Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29):51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A statement of the consensus (ijmaa`) upon that has already preceded [1] , and an explanation that the blind-follower (muqallid) is not from the people of knowledge; and Aboo `Umar ibn `Abdil-Barr and others also report ijmaa` (consensus) upon that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Transl. Note: [i.e. from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And no one disagrees with this except for the ignorant ones from the blind-followers, because of their ignorance of the Book and the Sunnah, and because of their turning away from these two. So those people, even if they think that they are following the imaams, then in reality they have only contradicted them and followed other than their way. So we have already quoted the saying of Maalik, ash-Shaafi`ee, and Ahmad. <strong>However in the speech of Ahmad – rahimahullaah – there is an indication that &#8220;taqleed‟ (blind-following) before the proof reaches is not blameworthy; rather it is only criticised for one whom the proof has reached, and he opposes it in favour of the saying of one of the imaams.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this only comes about as a result of their turning away from seeking to understand the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger; and turning instead to the books of the later people, and sufficing with them to the exclusion of the two parts of Revelation. So this resembles what occurred with the People of the Book: those about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They took their scholars and monks as lords besides Allaah</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):31],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an explanation of which will follow in the hadeeth of `Adiyy ibn Haatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is binding upon the one who is sincere is that when he reads the books of the scholars, and examines them, and becomes aware of their sayings, that he submits them to what is found in the Book, and the Sunnah; for every mujtahid from the scholars, and those who follow him and ascribe themselves to his madhhab, must mention his evidence; and the truth in any matter is one; and the imaams are rewarded for their ijtihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the justly balanced person makes examination of their speech, and consideration of it a path to acquiring awareness of the different issues, and a means to bring them to mind, and a way to distinguish what is correct from what is incorrect – by means of the evidences which those who use the evidences mention; so that in this way he will become aware of which scholar was most fortunate in having the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the proofs for this fundamental principle are more than can be enumerated, in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah likewise….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the imaams – rahimahumullaah – did not fall short in clarifying this matter. Rather they forbade that they be followed blindly when the Sunnah becomes clear, because they knew that there were matters of knowledge unknown to them, and that this knowledge could reach others, and this occurs a great deal; and this will not be hidden from one who examines the sayings of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth comes from Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) then it is upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Companions – radiyallaahu `anhum – then upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Taabi`een, then we are men and they were men.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If I say a saying, and the Book of Allaah contradicts it, then abandon my saying in favour of the Book of Allaah.” It was said: &#8220;If the saying of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the narration of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). It was said: &#8220;If the saying of the Companions contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the saying of the Companions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ar-Rabee` said: I heard ash-Shaafi`ee – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you find in my book something contrary to the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), then take hold of the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and leave whatever I said.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth is authentic with something contrary to my saying, then throw my saying against the wall.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone is such that some of his sayings are taken and some are left, except for Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this has already been mentioned from him, so there is no excuse for a blind-follower (muqallid) after this… .”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-`Uthaymeen On ‘Taqleed’ (Blindfollowing)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;al-Qawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed‟ (2/152):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Some people commit a grievous mistake when it is said to them: &#8220;Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said‟, he says: &#8220;But in the book of so and so there occurs such and such.‟ So it is upon him to fear Allaah, Who said to him in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And the Day when Allaah will call to them, and say, &#8220;What response did you give to the Messengers?</span> [Sooratul-Qasas (28):65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say: &#8220;What response did you give to so and so?‟ As for the author of the book, then if it is known that he loves good, and intends good, then supplication for forgiveness and mercy is made for him if he errs. It is not to be said that he is infallible, and his saying used to contradict the saying of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Some biased and questionable people these days are promoting by way of the internet and calling the youth of this country to disregard obedience to the leaders/government of the country and to instead oppose them. They also call the youth not to listen to the scholars in this regard. So, we ask for your counsel and comments on this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding refuting the book ‘Sunnah Nabaweeyah Bayn Ahl-ul-Fiqh wa Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ [By Muhammad Ghazali] since there are flaws concerning the hadeeth, many of the scholars have refuted it. What is your opinion about the book? What’s your opinion about the refutations?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This book is very dangerous to the Sunnah, and to the scholars of the Sunnah and the followers of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that those who refuted it are united upon the truth, even though their methods may differ. From them are those who are strict, from them are those who are easy going and from them are those who are in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This man [Muhammad Ghazali] in addition to not being a critic<strong>,</strong> he is not established upon the knowledge of hadeeth nor upon the foundations of Fiqh principles, and along with that he adds to his use of evidence the opinions of others mockingly.  This is not what someone does whose aim it is to advise the people, so because of this he exposed himself to many, many problems and he is deserving of these problems. It is sufficient that he attacked the Ahadeeth which are present in the ‘Saheeh’ without following the methodology of the scholars and critics as some of them did in the olden days like; Daraqutni, and the likes of Ibn Taymeeyah, and Ibn al-Qayyim, when they would critically examine some of the Ahadeeth. However, they would criticize with knowledge, piety and reflection.  As for this man then he does not criticize except with his own desires from one direction, and with ignorance of hadeeth and its texts from another direction.  Due to this the scope of refuting him is very extensive, so perhaps those who take part in refuting him with their different methods, they took part in that which was obligatory upon them in supporting hadeeth firstly, and the scholars of hadeeth and its followers. This is a brief answer according to what you mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Questioner continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do you not see O noble Shaykh, regarding this topic that it is better for the current scholars of Islaam to schedule a meeting and a debate about this subject, this is from one direction. Also<strong>,</strong> do you not see that it is necessary for the noble scholars of Islaam, the likes of yourself to author a refutation against this man, since these great refutations have an effect upon the people. Also<strong>,</strong> do you not see that there should be more refutations against him, more than a lecture and gathering because he has affected the minds of many of the Muslims?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is true, with no doubt or suspicion, however the issue is, as has been said a long time ago:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Not everything a person wishes, can be achieved * A ship does not want a severe storm to blow’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have many works, which unfortunately do not allow me the scope to undertake some of the other religious obligations, this is due to the many projects that I am connected to.  However, perhaps those who have undertaken refuting this person, should form a committee to study these refutations and choose the best of them, then print them and distribute them to the people, to bring this refutation closer to all the people especially those who have been allured by the philosophy of this man and his tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for me personally, I am unable and cannot. I indeed held the opinion for example, of at least going to Afghanistan for calling to the Book and the Sunnah, at least amongst the different Arab nationalities, and I excused myself as you can see of my old age.  Otherwise it is necessary to undertake refuting this man, and from those who refuted this person, <strong>the likes of our brother Dr. Rabia’ bin Hadi, the professor of the subject of hadeeth in the university, you may have come across his refutation, indeed he has more knowledge of hadeeth than other than him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, as for your suggestion of forming a committee of scholars to debate this man, then I don’t think that there will be any benefit whatsoever, because you have been trialed before him with some of the Soofeeyah, who supported some Bida’ and the superstitious acts of the Soofeeyah.  It was seen that he could be rectified and be debated but this did not benefit him whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps, what is more advisable or better for rectification and beneficial is to form a small committee made up of some of the noble scholars and they choose the strongest and closest from these refutations in understanding, or that they choose from the collection of these refutations, issues which are stronger, and rewrite them with sentences which are clear and understandable for the general people.  This is my opinion, and Allaah knows best.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The praise of Shaykh Rabia’ al-Madhkhalee for the<em>Muhadith</em>, the <em>‘Allaama</em>, Shaykh of Hadeeth Muhammad Nasr ud-Deen al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Is Shaykh al-Albaani at the head of the ahl-ul-Hadeeth of this time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer of the <em>‘Allaama al-Muhadith</em> Rabia’ bin Hadi ‘Umair al-Madhkhalee <em>HafidhAllaah</em>, and May Allaah raise his grade in both worlds, was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘I swear by Allaah that this is what Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen submit to, as do the other scholars who have spent time in his company. They submit to the fact that there is none that can be compared with him in hadeeth, never can any one be compared with him, actually, for many centuries no one has reached to where Shaykh al-Albaani has reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">I hold the opinion, that in study of books, neither Ibn Taymeeyah, nor Ibn Hajr reached him in the study of books.  As for memorization, then they memorized more than him, but as for study and research and working extremely hard in research then there is none in comparison to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He has offered a library for Islaam.  The Islaamic Countries and their institutions fall short in offering this amount. Anyone who now writes about hadeeth has to refer back to this man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">This man was oppressed, and the Arabs never knew his reality. Allaah took this man from the heart of Europe and placed him in the Dhahireeyah library, the best library in the east, where he spent sixty years, and he put forward this great work. What did he get in return from us?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">With sadness, the virtue of a people is only known by those who posses it.  As for the scholars, they knew his virtue and they acknowledged that, such as the likes of Ibn Baaz, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, and the scholars of Islaam other than them.  The scholars of India and Pakistan and the Western Arab Regions and of other places knew the status of this man, from what he placed forward for this<em>Ummah</em>, in <em>‘Aqeedah, Manhaj</em> and the service to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– alayhi as-Salaat wa Salaam &#8211;</em>, may Allaah have mercy on him, and reward him with goodness for the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <em>– alayhi as-Salaat wa Salaam &#8211;</em>, the reward for those who do good actions, and for those who gave a service to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and His <em>Deen. Naaam</em>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad &#8216;Umar Bazmool<br />
SOURCE: His treatise At-Ta&#8217;seel fee Talab-il-&#8216;Ilm<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth Foundation: The Scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets, so one must observe good manners in front of them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abud-Dardaa (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) say: <b>‘Whoever treads a path due to which he seeks knowledge, Allaah will make him tread one of the paths towards Paradise. And the angels lower their wings out of contentment for the seeker of knowledge. And verily all those in the heavens and in the earth, even the fish in the depths of the sea ask forgiveness for the scholar. And verily, the virtue of the scholar over the worshipper is like the virtue of the moon on the night of Al-Badr over all of the stars. Indeed, the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets, for the prophets do not leave behind a dinar or a dirham for inheritance, but rather, they leave behind knowledge. So whoever takes hold of it, has acquired a large share (i.e. of inheritance).’</b>” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim Ibn Hibbaan, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: “There is a clear explanation in this hadeeth that the scholars, who possess the virtue we mentioned before, are the ones who teach the people the knowledge of the Prophet, apart from all of the other types of knowledge. Did you not see him say: <b>‘The scholars are the inheritors of the prophets?’</b> The prophets do not leave behind any inheritance except knowledge, and the knowledge of our Prophet r is his Sunnah. So whoever is deprived of learning it is not from the inheritors of the prophets.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This foundation necessitates the implementation of several things, which include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. One must have good manners with the scholars<br />
He should not debate with his teacher<br />
He should not ask his teacher too many questions<br />
He should not cause commotions in his gathering<br />
He should praise him when speaking to him and while mentioning him in his absence<br />
He should hold good thoughts for him and his knowledge<br />
He should behave while in his gathering<br />
He should show respect for him in his daily transactions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This does not mean that the student should not contradict his teacher when a proof that deserves to be followed becomes established to him. It has been narrated from Abu Ayyoob As-Sakhtiyaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him, that he said: “If you want to know the errors of your teacher, then sit with someone else (i.e. another teacher).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Taking knowledge from the shuyookh (teachers) is the basis with regard to seeking knowledge. By doing this, the student takes knowledge from them face to face, and grasps from their manners and behavior. This only applies if the student is a contemporary of those teachers and around during their lifetime! Or he can take from their books and writings, thus reading from them in order to learn and understand, while of course, having good thoughts (for them)!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah&#8221; (pg. 34-39)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are the ones to be referred to and turned to regarding the important issues, especially in matters that concern the welfare of the Muslim ummah. If you look at the condition of the first generations from the Salaf as-Saalih, you would find that they were strict with regard to returning back to the senior scholars that were alive in their time, especially in getting rulings that resulted in making <i>tabdee’</i> (declaring someone an innovator) or <i>takfeer</i> (declaring someone a disbeliever). [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the example of Yahyaa bin Ya’mar Al-Basree and Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree Al-Basree, when the Qadariyyah appeared in their time and they began to manifest contradictions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be declared disbelievers or that they be pronounced innovators and removed from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. However, they did not rush into making a ruling against them. Rather, they went to those who held the position of being referred to with regard to issues of knowledge, from the scholars. And he was ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>). So they informed him of what occurred to them and he issued a ruling to them stating the misguidance and deviation of (this group of) the Qadariyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa bin Ya’mar said: “The first person who spoke (deviant views) with regard to Al-Qadar in Basrah was Ma’bad Al-Juhnee. Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree and I set out to make Hajj or ‘Umrah, and we said to each other: “If only we could meet one of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger so that we could ask him about what these people are saying about Al-Qadar. So Allaah granted us that ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>) enter the masjid So I and my companion gathered around him – one of us on his right and the other on his left. I felt as if my companion entrusted me with speaking to him, so I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Abu ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, a people have appeared in our land that recite the Qur’aan and pursue knowledge…[and he mentioned some other points about them]…and they claim that there is no such thing as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree) and that it is rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He responded: “If you meet these people, inform them that I am free from them and thy are free from me. By the One whom ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar swears by, if one of them had the likes of Mount Uhud in gold and he were to give it away in charity, Allaah would not accept it from him, until he believes in Al-Qadar.“ Then he said: “My father reported to me…” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at the example of Zubayd ibn Al-Haarith Al-Yaamee when the Murji’ah appeared in his time and he saw that they had oppositions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be ousted from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Yet, he did not rush into making a ruling against them. Instead, he went to one who had the position of being referenced in religious matters in his time from the people of knowledge and fatwaa, those who took their knowledge from the Seniors amongst the Companions, who in this case was Abu Waa’il Shaqeeq bin Salamah Al-Asadee Al-Koofee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Zubayd went to him informing him of what had occurred, and Abu Waa’il issued a fatwaa to him based on a text from Allaah’s Messenger, which indicated the falsehood of the misconceptions of the Murji’ah and their deviating from Ahlus-Sunnah. Zubayd said: “When the Murji’ah appeared, I went to Abu Waa’il and mentioned that to him, so he said: ’Abdullaah narrated to me that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘Reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.’</b>” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you were to compare between the condition of these people with regard to how they looked toward the people of knowledge in their time and between the condition of many of those who have become unstable in their repentance in this time of ours, you would find a huge difference between the two examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those people (in the first example) strove hard to implement this rule, and they did not rush to make a ruling against those people of their time whose deviation become apparent, until they first presented their case to the people of knowledge, those capable of issuing rulings (fatwaa) from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. So when they heard the ruling, they bit onto it with their molar teeth and distanced themselves from those deviants who were in opposition to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for today, then it is very rare that you can find those who strive hard to implement this rule. Rather, you will find those who have no concern for the words of the people of knowledge and fatwaa with regard to warning against the people of desires and innovation. So they wage war against the fataawaa (religious rulings) of the scholars and they distort their (intended) meanings. We ask Allaah to save and protect us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] This does not mean that a student of knowledge is not to rule on issues altogether. What is meant here is that he should not rule on issues related to current occurrences, from the outset, especially those that are ambiguous from it. As for the clear issues, which are not ambiguous, then he is not required to refer to them (i.e. the scholars).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 44<br />
Revering the Scholars and Elders, Preferring them to others and raising their<br />
Status</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Say: `Are those who know equal to those who know not?&#8217; It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e., get a lesson from Allah&#8217;s Signs and Verses).&#8221;</b></span><b> (39:9)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>348.</b> Abu Mas`ud `Uqbah bin `Amr Al-Badri Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The person who is best versed in the recitation of the Book of Allah, should lead the prayer; but if all those present are equally versed in it, then the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah; if they are equal in that respect too, then the one who has emigrated (to Al-Madinah) first, if they are equal in this respect also, then the oldest of them. No man should lead another in prayer where the latter has authority, or sit in his house, without his permission&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another narration in Muslim: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One who is senior most in accepting Islam, should lead the Salat (prayer)&#8221;</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A man who is well versed in the Book of Allah and can recite it better, should lead the Salat (prayer); if (all those present) are equal in this respect, then the man who is senior most in respect of emigration, if they are equal in that respect too, then the oldest of them should lead the prayer&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>349.</b> Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would place his hands upon our shoulders when we would form rows for As-Salat (the prayer) and say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Stand in straight rows and do not differ among yourselves, or else your hearts will differ due to disaccord. Let those be nearest to me who are mature and endowed with understanding (of the religion), then those who are nearest to them in these respects and then those who are nearest to them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>350.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let those be nearest to me in Salat (prayer) who are mature and possess (religious) knowledge, then those who are nearest to them in these respects&#8221;.</span> He repeated this three times and then added,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Beware of indulging in the loose talks of the markets (when you are in the mosque)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>351.</b> Sahl bin Abu Hathmah Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: `Abdullah bin Sahl and Muhaiyisah bin Mas`ud ¨(May Allah be pleased with them) went to Khaibar during the period of the truce (after its conquest) and they separated to perform their duties. When Muhaiyisah returned to `Abdullah bin Sahl, he found him murdered, drenched in his blood. So he buried him and returned to Al-Madinah. Then `Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, Huwaiyisah and Muhaiyisah, the two sons of Mas`ud went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. `Abdur-Rahman, who was the youngest of them all, started talking. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Let those older than you speak first.&#8221; So he stopped talking and the (other two) spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Will you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man?&#8221; And mentioned the rest of the Hadith.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>352.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: After the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) arranged the burial of two of the martyrs in one grave. In each case he would ask,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Which one of them had learnt more Qur&#8217;an by heart?</span>&#8221; Whichever was thus pointed out to him, was placed by him first in the Lahd.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>353.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with tehm) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It was shown to me in my dream that I was cleaning my teeth with a Miswak and two men came to me, one being older than the other. I gave the Miswak to the younger one, but I was asked to give it to the older, which I did&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>354.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is out of reverence to Allah in respecting an aged Muslim, and the one who commits the Qur&#8217;an to memory and does not exaggerate pronouncing its letters nor forgets it after memorizing, and to respect the just ruler&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>355.</b> `Amr bin Shu`aib (May Allah be pleased with him)on the authority of his father who heard it from his father reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He is not one of us who shows no mercy to younger ones and does not acknowledge the honour due to our elders&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>356.</b> Maimun bin Abu Shabib (May Allah had mercy upon him) reported: A begger asked `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) for charity and she gave him a piece of bread. Thereafter, one well-dressed person asked her for charity and she invited him to sit down and served him food. When she was asked about the reason for the difference in treatment, she said: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) instructed us:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Treat people according to their status&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>357.</b> Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: `Uyainah bin Hisn came to Al-Madinah and stayed with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais who was among those who were close to `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) and had access to his council. The scholarly persons, whether they were old or young, had the privilege of joining his council and he used to consult them. `Uyainah said to Al-Hurr:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;My dear nephew, you have an access to the Leader of the Believers. Will you obtain permission for me to sit with him?</span>&#8221; Al-Hurr asked `Umar and he accorded permission. When `Uyainah came into the presence of `Umar, he addressed him thus:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O son of Al-Khattab, you neither bestow much on us nor deal with us justly.&#8221;</span> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) got angry and was about to beat him when Al-Hurr said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Leader of the Believers, Allah has said to his Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam):</span><span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e., don&#8217;t punish them), [i.e., `Uyainah]</span> (7:199). This is one of the ignorant ones.&#8221; By Allah! When al-Hurr recited this, `Umar became quite motionless in his seat. He always adhered strictly to the Book of Allah.<br />
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>358.</b> Abu Sa`id Samurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I was a boy during the lifetime of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and used to commit to my memory what he said, but I do not narrate what I preserved because there were among us people who were older than me.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>359.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a young man honours an older person on account of his age, Allah appoints someone to show reverence to him in his old age&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh bin Bâz [1]<br />
Source: Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to facing the trials and calamities that have befallen the Islaamic world?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: From that which there is no doubt about is that sins, and being far removed from the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) &#8211; in both sayings and actions &#8211; are from the greatest reasons of bringing about the various crisis and calamities that have befallen the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whatever of good reaches you, it is from Allaah; and whatever of evil befalls you, it is from yourself.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:79]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. Yet He pardons much.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:30]. So Allaah is Most Forgiving and the Most Merciful to His servants, sending to them clear signs and warnings, in order that they may run back to Him in <i>tawbah</i> (sincere repentance) and that He may forgive them. So when a person runs to Allaah and draws closer to Him by an arm&#8217;s length, then Allaah draws closer to him by two arm&#8217;s length. For indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; loves those of His servants that turn to Him in <i>tawbah</i> and is happy with that, whilst He &#8211; the Majestic, the Most High &#8211; remains absolutely self-sufficient from His servants. The obedience of the obedient ones does not benefit Him, nor do the sins of the sinful ones harm Him. But He is Most Kind, Ever Merciful to His servants. And He grants them the ability to do acts of obedience and to leave acts of disobedience. So these crisis and calamities are none other than a warning to His servants, in that they should turn back to Allaah in repentance and obedience, and He informs them of this by way of testing them. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And certainly We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruit. But give glad tidings to those who have <i>sabr</i> (patience); those who, when afflicted with a calamity, say: Indeed to Allaah we belong, and to Him shall we return. They are those for whom are the <i>salawaat</i> (blessings and forgiveness) from their Lord, and His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155] Allaah &#8211; the One free From all defects &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Evil has appeared on the land and the sea, because of what the hands of men have earned. That Allaah may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return to Allaah in repentance.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:41]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We shall test you by way of evil and good, and to Us will you return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:35]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We tested them with good blessings and evil calamities, in order that they may return to the obedience of Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:168]. And there are many other Verses with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the obligation upon the leaders of the Muslims &#8211; the Scholars, rulers, and other than them &#8211; is to have concern for the various afflictions and calamities that occurs, and to remind and admonish the people, and explain to them what they have fallen into. Also. those in authority &#8211; from the Scholars and the rulers &#8211; should set a good example of righteous conduct and should discuss the reasons as to why Allaah is angered and gives retribution; and they should seek to cure this with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance), <i>istighfaar</i> (seeking Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness) and correcting their affairs. The rest of the Ummah will then follow them in this, since the guidance of the Scholars, and the wisdom of the rulers &#8211; and both being correct and upright &#8211; has one of the greatest effects with regards to the fulfillment of responsibilities. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Each of you is a guardian, and is responsible for those whom he is in charge of. So the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for those under his care; a woman is a guardian of her husband&#8217;s home and is responsible for those under her care; a servant is the guardian of his master&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which he is entrusted with; and a man is the guardian of his father&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which is under his care. So each one of you is a guardian and is responsible for what he is entrusted with.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, when the Muslims become accustomed to sinning and with being contented with it, and those who wield authority and power do not try to prevent them, then Allaah&#8217;s anger will quickly descend upon the Ummah. And when His anger occurs, and His punishment takes place, then it covers both the sinful and obedient, and Allaah&#8217;s protection is sought from this. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And beware of the <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord) that does not affect in particular only those amongst you who are wrong-doers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Afaal 8:25]. Likewise. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;When the people see an evil, and they do not try to change it, then Allaah will cover them all with punishment from Himself.</i>&#8220;3 Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Indeed Allaah will not change the condition of a people until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11]. So the Scholars will be thorougly questioned in front of Allaah with regards to them giving knowledge and guidance to the people, and explaining to them what is correct and what is wrong, and also clarifying the beneficial from the harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah that He favours all the Muslims and grants them the ability to be obedient to their Lord, and to cling to the guidance of their Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that He grants their leaders the ability to fulfill their duties, and that He teaches their Scholars the ways of guidance, so that they may all traverse its path and direct the Ummah to it, and that He guides the misguided Muslims and corrects their affairs. Indeed He is the Guardian over this, and the One having power to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: The enemies of Allaah are very eager to enter into the Muslim lands by various methods. So what efforts do you believe should be exerted in order to put a stop to this surge that has threatened the Islaamic societies?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: This is not something strange coming from the callers to Christianity, Judaism, or the other religions of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Since Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; and to Him belongs all praise &#8211; has informed us about this in His clear Revelation, when He said: <b>&#8220;Never will the Jews and the Christians be pleased with you until you follow their ways of life. Say: Indeed the Guidance of Allaah, that is the only true Guidance. And if you were to follow their false desires after what you have received of the knowledge of Revelation, then you would have neither a guardian, nor any helper against Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And they will never stop fighting you, until they turn you away from your Religion, if they can.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:217]. This is why they utilize every possible means to penetrate into the Muslim lands, and use various methods and tactics to acheive this. One of their methods is to plant the seeds of doubt and uncertainty into the minds and thoughts &#8211; and they continue to do so without easing-up or become weary &#8211; utilising the church to spread their hatred and enmity, and directing their efforts through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory upon the leaders and Scholars to exert every possible effort in cautioning and directing the Muslim children, and to oppose the efforts of the enemies of Islaam with countermeasures. For indeed the Ummah of Islaam is an Ummah that has been entrusted  with a responsibility of carrying this Religion and conveying it to others. So when we &#8211; in the Islaamic societies &#8211; are determined to arm our sons and daughters with correct knowledge, and true understanding of the Religion; beginning this process at an early age, then we will never fear the enemy &#8211; by the permission of Allaah. Thus, as long as we continue to cling to the Religion of Allaah, glorifying and venerating Him, following His <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws), and fighting those who oppose Him, then the opposite will happen; it will be the enemies of Allaah who will fear the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the One to Whom belongs all praise &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who believe. If you help Allaah by acting upon what you have been commanded with, then Allaah will plant your feet firmly by giving you victory over your enemies.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7]. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;But if you have <i>sabr</i> (remain patient) and have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety) by doing what Allaah orders and refraining from what He has prohibited, then no harm will their cunning plots be to you at all. Indeed Allaah encompasses everything by His Knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120]. And there are plenty of other Verses with similar meaning. So the most important factor in stopping this attack is to prepare a generation that truly know and understands the realities of Islaam. This can be achieved by giving them the correct guidance and cultivation at home, and by utilising the various means of education in order to develop the society. Add to this the role of guiding, which is the duty of those in authority, and their duty of being constant in doing beneficial acts, being constant in reminding the people with what is of benefit to them, and doing that which cultivates the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah </i>(belief) in the people: <b>&#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts truly find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that negligence is one of the causes that lets the enemies of Islaam into the Muslim lands &#8211; along with their ideological attack &#8211; which gradually distances the Muslims from their Religion, step by step. So with this, evil will increase amongst them and they will be affected by the false ideologies of their enemies. And Allaah &#8211; One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; ordered the Believers to have <i>sabr</i> (patience), to call to patience, and to strive in His Path using every method at their disposal; as He &#8211; the Most Majestic, Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe. Persevere and be more patient, and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and have <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah (by doing what He orders and keeping away from what He prohibits) in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:200]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And those who strive hard in Our cause, We shall surely guide them to Our Avenues. Indeed Allaah is with the doers of good.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah by His beautiful Names and lofty Attributes that He improves and corrects the affairs of the Muslims, and that He grants to them the understanding of the Religion, gathers the word of their leaders upon the truth, and improves and corrects their close advisors. Indeed He is the Most Kind, Most Generous. And may Allaah extol and send abundant blessings of peace upon our Leader and our Prophet, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and his true followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> says in His Book,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Are they equal, those who have knowledge and those who do not? But only the men of understanding will take admonition.&#8221;</span> [Soorah Zumar 39:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">“<strong>Allaah</strong> will raise up in degrees those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge.&#8221;</span><br />
[Soorah al-Mujaadalah 58:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is only those who possess knowledge amongst His slaves that fear <strong>Allaah</strong>&#8220;</span><br />
[Soorah Faatir 35:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> asserted,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">“The superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like that of the moon over the rest of the stars.”</span><br />
[Abu Dawood and Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, those who have also been described as the ‘inheritors of the prophets’ by our Noble Messenger<em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> hold an honourable and lofty station in the deen of <em>Islaam</em>. They are those who clarify the affairs of the religion to us and teach us that which will aid us in this life and the next. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to recognize this high rank of theirs and give them their due right and not fall short in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaam Ahmad (rahimahullaah)</em> beautifully described the reality of the scholars in the following,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All Praise is for <strong>Allaah</strong> Who, in every age and interval between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge who call the misguided to guidance and patiently bear ill-treatment and harm. With the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> they give life to the dead, and by <strong>Allaah&#8217;s</strong> light they give sight to the blind. How many a person killed by <em>iblees</em> have they revived. How many people astray and wandering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They repel from the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones-those who uphold the banner of innovation and let loose the trials and discords.”<strong> [Ar-Radd &#8216;alal-Jahmiyyah waz-Zanaadiqah of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh ‘Abdur Rahmaan al-Adani (hafidhahullaah)</em> will admonish us regarding this affair and by the Permission of <strong>Allaah</strong> cause us to truly understand and respect the honourable status of our scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to grant us beneficial knowledge and to place in our hearts sincere love for the<em> ‘ulamaa`</em> of<em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Certainly there has appeared between the students of knowledge during this time, the taking of knowledge from those young in age. This phenomenon in reality is a cancerous disease and a chronic illness and it hinders the student of knowledge from his intent and turns him away the sound path that will connect him to knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because taking knowledge from those who are young in age; those who did not firmly establish their feet in knowledge, their beards did not become grey within it (they did not spend a long time with seeking knowledge) along with the presence of those older than them in age, whose feet are grounded, because of this the foundation of the beginner is weak. He is prevented from the benefit of the experience of the major scholars and attainment of their manners which is established by knowledge and time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences that give reason to this is the athar of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from their elders, their trusted and their scholars. If they (begin) taking knowledge from their sighaar and evil ones, then they are destroyed&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is the affirmed Hadeeth on the authority of Abi Umayyah al Jamhee, that the Messenger of Allaah ملس و هيلع الله ىلص said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;From the signs of the hour is when knowledge sought from al-asaagheer&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people have differed in relation to the explanation of the word: &#8220;as-sighaar&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is some speech which Ibn Abdul Barr (may Allaah have Mercy on him) mentioned in al-Jaami&#8217; and ash-shatibi (may Allaah have Mercy on him) mentioned in al-i&#8217;tisaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him) took the view that <span style="color:#0000ff;">as-sighaar are those who are young in age</span>. And he said regarding the athar of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He intended that the people will not cease to be upon good as long as their scholars are mashaayakh (old) and that their scholars are not young (in age), because the shaykh (elderly) has left the pleasure of youth, his temper, his hastiness, his foolishness and he prefers practice and experience and nothing doubtful enters into his knowledge, his desires do not overcome him and he is not tempted by lust or greed. Shaytan does not cause him to fall (but) causes the young to. The one with age has dignity, honor and prestige.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young maybe will enter into some of these affairs that the elderly is safe from. If these affairs enter into him and he makes a ruling (then) he is destroyed and destroys others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn abdul Barr reported that Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;I knew when the uprightness of the people (was present) and when they became corrupted. When (an issue) of fiqh came from the young (in age) the elderly turned away from following them. And when (an issue) of fiqh came from the elderly; the young followed them and they were both guided.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr also reported on the authority of Aboo Ahwas from Abdullah who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Certainly you will always remain upon good as long as knowledge is found in your elderly and when knowledge is found in your young, the young will make the elderly appear foolish.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two Athars are proofs for not taking knowledge from the young. Another besides which Ibn Qutaybah mentioned and it was fear of accepting knowledge if it came from the youth. At any rate, if its wording; as-sagheer is general (then) it is used in a way perceived and meaning (young in age).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ruling is not without exception regarding the young in age, since a group from amongst the companions and taabi’een used to give fataawa and teach during their youth in the presence of those old in age. Certainly it is rare to find the likes of these individual so what about anyone after them. If they (the young) were present and their uprightness was known and their knowledge was examined and its firmness was apparent and no one from amongst the elders were found, then whatever knowledge they (the young) had with them was taken and safe from fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajjaaj bin Ar-Taah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The people use to dislike that a man speak until grey was seen in his beard.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The intent is not that knowledge of the young should be abandoned in the presence of the old; no! The intent is only to put people in their proper places.</strong> </span>So the right of the intelligent young student is that he is benefited from in research, giving reminders and studies. As for putting him forward for giving rulings and questions being put forward to him the no! Certainly no! Because this will kill him and this is a fitna and deception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl ibn Iyaad said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“If you see a man gathering the people around him, then I say this (person) is crazy. What person gathers the people around him and does not like that they make good his speech” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It has reached me that the scholars of the past when they learned they acted, and when they acted they became busy,When they became busy they became lost (missing) and when they became lost they were sought (after) and when they were sought they fled &#8220;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O seeker of knowledge if you desire knowledge from its source (fountain) then, here are the major scholars, those whose beards have become grey and bodies have become frail and strength have become weak (being exhausted) in knowledge and learning. Their commitments are before their lost and they bring out their treasures before they pass away (along) with them. (As) in the darkness of the night the Badr (moon) passes away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>A point of attention: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During these times the standards have been greatly blemished by the common people regarding properly estimating the scholars. So every individual who can give an eloquent speech, or a meaningful lecture, or a Friday sermon haphazardly becomes a scholar. He then becomes someone returned to for rulings and knowledge is taken from him. This is a painful and apparent affliction which its evil is airborne and it harms is circulated. When the connection of knowledge is (connected) to other than its people and when the affair (are in the hands) of other than its people, then look for the hour (Day of Judgment)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the student must be warned of taking knowledge from these (types). Except if they are known to be from people who possess knowledge. Not everyone who has good expression is a scholar and not everyone who turns the people’s faces towards him with issues regarding the leaders of the Muslims or the mentioning of the death rate of aids and whatever is similarly to that is a scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Also) the meaning is not what has proceeded – as some understand it- ex. Not listening to them (the young in age) or not benefitting from their talks, No! The intent is only taking legislative knowledge from them and not raising them to the levels of the scholars and Allaah is the One Who gives success.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the very nature of <em>fitnah </em>(trial and discord) is that matters become confused, mistakes increase, and minds and intellects begin to swerve. Protection and safety from this, in such times lies in the <em>Jamaa&#8217;ah</em>; at the head of which are the scholars. So it is obligatory upon the people &#8211; those leading and those being led &#8211; to take hold of the sayings of the Scholars and to act upon them. Since the general masses are pre-occupied with issues of fitnah, wherein they begin to express their own opinions, only leads to an increase in the fitnah and further splits the <em>Ummah</em>. So the <em>umoorul-&#8216;aammah</em> (affairs pertaining to public benefit and welfare) &#8211; from the matters related to peace, security and fear &#8211; should be referred back to those who possess sound knowledge and understanding, as <em>Allah</em>, The Most High  has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When there comes to them some matter related to public welfare of security or fear, they make it known amongst the people. If they had referred it back to the Messenger <em>(sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>, or to those in authority amongst them, then the proper people would have investigated and evaluated the matter from them. Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of <strong>Allah</strong> upon you, you would have indeed followed <em>Shaytaan</em> &#8211; except for a few of you.&#8221;</span><strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa: 83]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee</em> <strong>(d.1376H)</strong> &#8211; <em>rahimahullah </em>–said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the disciplinary admonition from Allah to His Servants with regards to their unbefitting action. And it is a must for them, that when there comes to them some news concerning important issues such as issues connected to public welfare and safety of the Believers, or those that are related to breach of security, or fear of a calamity befalling them, that they should first verify such news and not be hasty in spreading it. Rather, they should refer such issues back to the Messenger <em>(sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> and to the people in authority; those who possess knowledge, understanding, sound advice, intellect, maturity and composure; those who understand the affairs and have knowledge of the associated benefits and harms. If they see that in broadcasting it there is a benefit and a cause of happiness for the Believers, and a means of protection from their enemies, then they should do so. This is why Allah said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then the proper people would have investigated and evaluated the matter from them.&#8221;</span> Meaning: they would evaluate it with their sound understanding and their firm and correct knowledge. So in this is an evidence for an important principle, which is, if there arises a need to investigate a particular issue, then it is obligatory that it be left to those who are qualified for it, and no one should precede them in this &#8211; and this is close to what is correct, and safer from error. And in this is also a prohibition of being hasty and impatient in spreading the news as soon as they hear it. Likewise there is a command to reflect and consider before speaking, so he looks into it to see if there is a benefit in doing so, if so he embarks upon it, and if not, he abstains from it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Tayseerul-Kareemur-Rahmaan (2/54-55). Refer also to Qawaa&#8217;id fee Ta&#8217;aamul ma&#8217;il-&#8216;Ulemaa (p.121)]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, we understand that it is absolutely imperative for us to take recourse in the Book of <strong>Allah</strong> and the<em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em>(sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> in these times of great fitnah. Our <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ramzaan (hafidhahullah)</em> will offer a timely admonition concerning the grand importance we must place on returning to the Scholars, who are the Inheritors of the Prophets, in these times of innumerable trials and tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allah</strong> to keep our feet firm upon the Straight Path and we seek refuge in Him from ever deviating from it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">O Virtuous Shaykh, with what do you advise us during this time (in) which trials (fitan) have increased and the people of innovation have become widespread and the death of the scholars? (are increasing)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you with the first thing (which is) to have<strong> taqwa of Allaah</strong> and <strong>increase in your supplication to Allaah</strong> that He keeps us and you firm upon the religion and that He protects us and you from the evils of trials (fitan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I advise you with <strong>seeking knowledge from the people of knowledge</strong> and the diligence in seeking knowledge, because one will not fall into trial (fitna) with Allaah’s permission (only) if he has the correct knowledge. But if you don’t have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don’t know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and <strong>do not become lazy</strong> upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.</p>

Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree relates: “I went to the University at the time of ‘Asr when Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin served as its president. And there would be no one in the University except for him and me. So I said to him: ‘Why don’t you bring someone who will open the University for you before you come?’ He replied: ‘I will not make anybody work at this time because it is a time of rest.’ This was at the time of ‘Asr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One graduate from the University related that when the Shaikh was president there he would not like to stop the university car on the road to buy things for the house. Meaning: Since the car was just to take him to and from work, he would not like to abuse this by using it for personal reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion, when his term of presidency ended, his driver saw him standing on the street waiting, so he passed by him as usual and offered to take him home, but he replied: “I wouldn’t think of it. My term as president has ended and I called my son to come and get me.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Cassette tape ”Aqwâl-ul-´Ulamâ’ fîl-Jihâd”<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith, Sweden<br />
Translation and Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">After the reckless attacks, the scholars that follow the methodology of the Salaf have been slandered a lot. They are accused of coaxing the disbelievers and of being to their satisfaction. How do you advise these people who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: What has this person, who slanders the scholars and accuses them of this and that, done himself? What has he done himself? What has he himself done? What has he done against the disbelievers? Or is he only talking without doing anything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, he is asked the question: Do you know what is means to coax? Do you know what it means to be to someone&#8217;s satisfaction? There is a difference between coaxing and pleasing someone. Does he know the difference? Or is he talking without knowledge?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly, one should during these circumstances keep one&#8217;s mouth closed. One should keep the mouth closed in order not to fall into gossiping, backbiting, and splitting the Muslims. The human is obliged to keep the mouth closed. These issues have their men who take care of them; the scholars and the rulers. They are the ones who treat these issues. It is namely not these people&#8217;s concern. There are correct people who take care of them. Allâh says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).&#8221; </span>(The Qur&#8217;ân 4:83, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not everyone is able to delve into these matters. These matters are for those charged with authority and they are the scholars and the rulers. This is their responsibility and we are obliged to advise them and pray for them that they get success in what they are doing and that they firmly remain established upon the truth. We have nevertheless no right to sit in our meetings and backbite this one, slander that one and insult the third. This is pure evil. There is no good in it. It is pure evil. All it leads to is the splitting of the Muslims and that one gets evil thoughts about the scholars and the rulers. And in the end, there&#8217;s just more tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to understand these matters. These issues are not a big mess. Religious issues have rules and principles. They have their sources. If you have some knowledge or something to clarify, then you should go to those responsible or write them a letter. However, that you should speak in sittings, this is considered to be disallowed. It leads to tribulations and evilness. You are talking with ignorant people who do not understand anything. You thereafter incite them against their brothers and rulers. Where is the benefit in this? If you have some knowledge or something to say, then you should go to the rulers. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The religion is an advice.&#8221; They (the companions) said: &#8220;To whom, O messenger of Allâh?&#8221; He said: &#8220;To Allâh, His book, His messenger, the leaders and laymen of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Nasîhah means that you advise, not that you disparage people and accuse them of coaxing and that they are to other&#8217;s satisfaction. It is worse than what you are afraid of.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> started off by saying that the <em>shayateen</em> from mankind and <em>jinn</em> have misguided many of the slaves of <strong>Allaah</strong> by three mighty deviations that are nothing but lies upon <strong>Allaah</strong>.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Taking people away from the texts i.e The Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad</em> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> to the opinions, desires and allegiances.</li>
<li>Glorifying ignorance amongst the people so much so that it became an objective that the majority of the people be upon that mannerism of ignorance.</li>
<li>Glorifying or thinking of some scholars as being holy and infallible.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result, it is necessary to clarify the straight path of <strong>Allaah</strong> and thus the <em>Shaykh</em> outlined some principles needed by the student of knowledge that he/she can use as a light on the path towards his/her <strong>Lord</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These principles include:-</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Allaah</strong> has clarified to the people the path of truth and the way to know the truth.</li>
<li>It is a must to bring the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad</em> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> above and beyond the intellect and analogy of the people.</li>
<li>It a must to understand the book and the <em>Sunnah</em> upon the understanding of the<em> salaf-us-saalih.</em></li>
<li>It is a must to know that the truth is being upon the understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em> or anybody upon that understanding i.e the scholars of this <em>deen</em> that have followed the first generations in <em>ihsaan</em>(perfection).</li>
<li>We must believe that the truth is always present in every time and every generation and it is not possible that you would have a time, generation or century in which there is no person guiding the people to the truth.</li>
<li>It is a must to know that even though the scholars are those who are guiding the people to the truth, it doesn’t mean that they are infallible and cannot or may not go against the truth even in one single matter.</li>
<li>Whoever tries to seek the proof from the book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, he should never ever leave it for the statement of anybody else regardless of who that person may be but rather he must follow the book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>.</li>
<li>The truth is independent of any man but the truth cannot be known except through the men who transmit it.</li>
<li>If the proof contradicts the statements of men, it is <em>waajib</em> upon us to bring forward the proof ahead of the statements of men.</li>
<li>Whoever is ignorant of the proofs of the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> and understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em>must go back to the rulings of the scholars.</li>
<li>Nobody after the Messenger of <strong>Allaah</strong> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> can be obeyed in everything he commands and forbids.</li>
<li>It is not permissible to say that every <em>mujtahid</em> (one who has the tools and strives to derive rulings from the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em>) is correct. The truth is only one and cannot be more than one.</li>
<li>The people of the <em>Sunnah</em> will suspect/accuse the opinions of people but will never accuse/suspect the religion of <strong>Allaah</strong>.</li>
<li>It is not permissible for anybody to delve into <em>ijtihaad</em> during times of calamity except if he is well qualified and has the capacity to be upon <em>ijtihaad</em>.</li>
<li>It is not correct to use as a proof against those who are calling to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> with the understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em> that the four <em>imaams</em> of the four <em>madhahib</em> have more precedence to be followed than the pious predecessors of this <em>Ummah</em>.</li>
<li>The people of the <em>Sunnah</em> will refute and correct whoever goes against the proofs of the Book and the<em>Sunnah</em> even if the one who went against the proofs is a <em>Shaykh</em> of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE</strong>: It is a must to warn against the people of innovation and desires, to warn against their statements, and this is the way of the companions of <em>Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and those who followed them from the <em>Taabi’oon</em> and those who follow them in <em>ihsaan</em> till the Day of Judgment.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> brought an abundance of proofs from the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> as well as the statements of our pious predecessors in explaining the aforementioned points.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A must listen for those who wish to acquaint themselves with the truth!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to make us align ourselves to the truth and the people of truth and rid us of the sickness of blind following anyone, and to make us avid followers of Muhammad <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar:</strong> ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: alfawzan.ws/node/5412<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
aFatwa.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> The scholars are known. Not all who got diplomas, graduate, memorise Hadîths and verses and read books are scholars with understanding. The scholars with understanding are known amongst the people. But many people only want that which suits them. He looks for that which suits him even if he were to get an answer from the most ignorant or most deviant people. What is most important is that he gets what suits him and his desire. It is a great error and especially today. The scholars are few. There are few scholars with understanding unlike those who read who are many. There are many who read but the scholars with understanding are few. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said [what means]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allâh does not seize this knowledge by pulling it out from the chests of men. It is seized by the death of the scholars. When there then are no scholar left, the people take the ignorant as leaders who in turn will answer without knowledge and go astray and lead others astray.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We fear that this has started today. We therefore have to be vigilant, apprehensive and observant. We have to choose the scholars and trustworthy who live today as good as we can. As for the early scholars, then they have past away. But one should stick to the best of those (who are) alive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“So fear Allah as much as you are able”<br />
<strong>(64:16, interpretation of the meaning)</strong></p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>Source: Imam Ibn al Qayyim, AI-Fawa&#8217;id, A COLLECTION OF WISE SAYINGS , Rendered into English by: Bayan Translation Services</div>
<p>[Read <a title="A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious) Scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his Knowledge" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com//2010/03/24/a-precious-and-valuable-gem-the-religious-scholar-whose-deeds-are-inconsistent-with-his-knowledge/">A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious) Scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his Knowledge</a> – Imam Ibn al Qayyim ]</p>
<p>We have previously mentioned the case of the religious scholar who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter. However, the mistake of the ignorant worshipper is rejecting knowledge, its verdicts, and his adherence to imagination and vain desires.</p>
<p>Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyainah and others said,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Beware of the trial of the immoral (religious) scholar and that of the ignorant worshipper, for both are apparent trials. The latter avoids knowledge out of ignorance, and the former calls for wrong doings out of immorality&#8221;.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, sets the example of the ignorant worshiper in the Qur&#8217;anic verse by saying,which means,</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Their allies deceived them) like Shai!an (Satan), when he says to man: &#8220;Disbelieve in Allah.&#8221; But when (man) disbelieves in Allah, Shaitan (Satan) says: &#8220;I am free of you, I fear Allah, the Lord of the &#8216;Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists)! So the end of both will be that they will be in the Fire, abiding therein. Such is the recompense of the ZalimOn (i.e. polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers in Allah and in His Oneness, etc.).&#8221;</span> (AI-Hashr, 59:16-17)</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">His story is well known, for he has based his life on worshipping Allah unknowingly, so Satan seized the opportunity and seduced him causing his disbelief. So, this is the end of every ignorant worshipper who unconsciously disbelieves, and the other one is the final end of every immoral scholar who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The religious scholars who prefer and Love this worldly life shall surely speak other than the truth concerning their judgments and religious verdicts. Verily, the judgments of Allah usually contradict the desires of people especially the rulers and those who follow their whims, as their aims cannot be attained except by opposing the truth.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, if the ruler and the religious scholar seek position and power and follow their desires, indeed they will not be able to fulfill their aims except by deviating from the truth, especially if there is a doubtful matter involved. The doubtful matter will agree with the desires of man, and vanity will prevail. As a result, righteousness will disappear, and truth will vanish.</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is no doubtful matter in the truth, so how can wrong doers dare to oppose it openly, assuming that they will be able to repent afterwards. Such behavior is mentioned in a Qur&#8217;anic verse in which Allah says, which means,</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them at their proper fixed times, etc.] and have followed lusts.&#8221;</span> (Mariam, 19:59)</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were also mentioned in another verse, in which Allah says,which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an excuse): &#8220;(Everything) will be forgiven to us. And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth? And they have studied what is in it (the Book). And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who are AI-Muttaqun (the pious). Do not you then understand?&#8217;</span>1 (Al-A&#8217;raf, 7:169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, informs us that those wrong doers have chosen the goods of this low life (the evil pleasures of this world) despite being aware of its unlawfulness. Moreover, they say, as an excuse, &#8220;(Everything) will be forgiven to us.And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins), so they are insistent upon that, and that is the reason why they dare to utter falsehood against Allah, assuming that the judgment and the religion of Allah are implied therein.Either they know the fact that the religion and the judgment of Allah contradict their claims, or they do not know. The result is that sometimes they utter falsehood against Allah, or else they say what is unlawful.On the other hand, the pious know quite well that the Hereafter is better than this worldly life, so loving leadership and following one&#8217;s desires would not be a temptation to them, so they would never prefer this worldly life to the Hereafter. They have only one path, which is abiding by the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. Besides, they seek help in patience and prayer, think deeply about this worldly life, its transient nature and its inferiority, and they compare it with the Hereafter, its greatness and the fact that it is eternal.Following one&#8217;s desires can blind the heart in a way that makes it confused between the Sunnah and innovation in religion. Sometimes, one may be confused whether or not an action is based on the Sunnah or on an innovation in religion. In fact, when misunderstandings like this occur, it is the fault of religious scholars as they prefer this worldly life and follow the rulers, and their vain desires.They are mentioned in these verses in which Allah says,which means,</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And recite (O Muhammad Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam)) to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but he threw them away, so Shaitan (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray. And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desire. So his description is the description of a dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or it you leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out&#8221;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf, 7: 175¬176)</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the likeness of the devious scholar of religion whose deeds contradict his knowledge.The previous verses dispraised this behavior as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>One</strong>: He has gone astray after having been knowledgeable, and he has knowingly chosen disbelief over faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Two</strong>: He abandoned faith entirely with no return, so, he threw away the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), like the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">serpent which throws away its skin</span>.So, if there was any remnant thereof, he could not throw it away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Three</strong>: Satan controlled him and so he tempted and seduced him, and that is why Allah says, &#8220;Satan followed him up, and He did not say, pursue him&#8221;, because following up means reaching and attaining him, which is much more eloquent than saying, &#8220;pursue him,&#8221; as far as meaning and expression are concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Four</strong>: He has erred after having been guided, which means that he has gone astray in knowledge and in intention, which is related to the corruption of his intention and deeds. Going astray is related to the corruption of knowledge and belief, and the corruption of one side entails the corruption of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Five</strong>: If Allah, the Exalted, had so willed, He could have elevated him with knowledge, which would have prevented his destruction. In other words, if he was not knowledgeable, it would have been much better for him, and would have meant a lesser torment for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Six</strong>: Allah, the Exalted, informed us about his wicked intention, mentioning that he has preferred inferiority rather than the most honorable and the most righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seven</strong>: His inferior choice was not chosen because of an idea that crossed his mind, on the contrary, it was chosen due to his desire to cling  to the earth. Clinging means permanent adherence, as if it was said, &#8220;He is sticking to the earth.&#8221; The Qur&#8217;anic expression described his inclination to this worldly life by referring to his clinging to the earth, because the worldly life is the earth, and those who are living therein, and everything that can be extracted thereof, either for adornment or enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eight</strong>: He deviated from the right path following his vain desires, so his own desire resembles a leader who should be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nine</strong>: He, the Almighty compared him to a dog, which is the most low amongst creatures, because of its greed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ten</strong>: He compares his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">covetousness </span>to this worldly life and his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">impatience </span>thereto and his grief of being deprived thereof by the lolling out of the dog&#8217;s tongue, whether it is left alone or driven away. Accordingly, if that person is left alone, then he will be covetous of this worldly life, and if he is advised he will still be covetous. of this worldly life. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">He clings to covetousness like the dog with its tongue lolling out</span>. Ibn Qutaibiyah said, &#8220;Surely everyone pants because they are exhausted or thirsty, except dogs, for it is their habit to pant while lolling their tongues out in all cases, whether they are exhausted or not, and whether they are thirsty or not, and that is why the Qur&#8217;anic expression compared it to the disbeliever, asserting that he has gone astray whether he is advised or left on his own. This is like the dog whether it is left alone or driven away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling of an individual who loves a scholar or a Da&#8217;ee and says: I love him very much, I do not want to listen to anyone refuting him and I take his word even if it goes against the evidence, because the shaykh has more knowledge of the evidence than us?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is detestable and blameworthy partisanship and it is not allowed. We love the scholars-and all praise is to Allaah-and we love the Du&#8217;aat (callers) for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. However if one from amongst them makes an error in an issue, we make clear the truth in that issue with the evidence and this does not decrease our love for the one who is refuted nor does it decrease his status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik-rahimahullaah- said: <strong>&#8220;There is no one from amongst us except that he will refute or be refuted, except the companion of this grave.&#8221;</strong> Meaning the Messenger of Allaah SAllaahu Alihee Wasallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we refute some of the people of knowledge and some of the people of virtue, this does not mean that we hate him or dispraise him, we only make clear what is correct and for this reason some of the scholars, when some of their colleagues made an error, said: <strong>&#8220;So and so is beloved to us, however the truth is more beloved to us than him. &#8220;</strong> And this is the correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not understand from this that to refute some of the scholars in an issue where they have erred in, means lowering them or having hatred for them. Rather the scholars have not ceased refuting each other and at the same time being brothers and having mutual love. It is not allowed for us to take everything that an individual says unquestionably, whether he is correct or in error, because this is partisanship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose statement is taken absolutely and nothing from it is left, is the Messenger of Allaah Sallaahu Alihee Wasallam. Because he is a Messenger from his Lord and does not speak from his desires. As for other than them (messengers), then sometimes they make errors and sometimes they are correct, even though they may be from the best of the people, they are Mujtahidoon that make mistakes at times and are correct at others. No one is infallible from falling into error except the Messenger of Allaah Sallaahu Alihee Wasallam. It is therefore Waajib that we know this and that we do not remain silent upon error, due to love of an individual. Rather it is upon us that we make the error clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Sallaahu Alihee Wasallam said: <strong>&#8220;The religion is sincere advice. We said: To whom. He said: To Allaah, His book, His messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their general people.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So clarification of an error is advice for all, as for concealing it, then this goes against advice.</p>
