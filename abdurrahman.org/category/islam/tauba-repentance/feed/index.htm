<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Necessity of approaching Allah with Tawbah and supplication in adversity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdul­‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baz to every Muslim who reads this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us remember Him and take warnings and lessons from the destinies unfolding before our eyes and lead us to sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from all sins and misdeeds. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) wills with His Deep Wisdom, absolute Proof, and all­ Encompassing Knowledge to test His Servants with prosperity and adversity, poverty and affluence, blessings and calamities, to try their patience and thankfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who is patient at the time of adversity, thankful at the time of prosperity, humbles themselves and supplicates to Allah upon facing hardships, acknowledges their sins and shortcomings, and asks Allah for His Mercy and Forgiveness, has succeeded and will be granted the blessed end. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif­ Lâm ­Mîm.</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings.]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allâh will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the truth of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are true, and will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the falsehood of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are liars, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test)</span><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitnah (trial) mentioned in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse) means the test of faith that makes evident the truthful from the liar, the patient and the thankful, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have made some of you as a trial for others: will you have patience? And your Lord is Ever All­ Seer (of everything)</span></strong>&#8220;. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We tried them with good </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(blessings) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(calamities)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in order that they might turn</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (to Allâh’s Obedience)</span>&#8220;. The good refers here to the blessings of fertility, prosperity, good health, honor, victory over enemies, and the like, while the evil here are adversities, such as diseases, domination of the enemy, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, torrential destructive floods, and the like. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(sins and disobedience to Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by oppression and evil deeds)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, that He</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by repenting to Allâh, and begging His Pardon)</span>&#8220;. This means that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined the good and the evil and the occurrence of corruption for people to return to Al-­Haqq (the Truth), to hurry and make Tawbah from what Allah has forbidden them, and hasten to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kufr (disbelief) and sins are the cause of all afflictions and evil in this world and the Hereafter, while tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and Iman (belief) in Him and His Messengers, obedience to Him and His Messengers, holding fast to His Shari‘ah (Islamic law), Da‘wah (calling) people to it, and refuting those who oppose it, are the causes of all good in this world and in the Hereafter. Perseverance on these principles and enjoining and cooperating in them bring honor in this world and the Hereafter, and salvation from every evil and protection from every Fitnah (trial). Allah (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you help </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the cause of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. And He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(may He be Praised) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">says: Verily, Allâh will help those who help His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Cause)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Truly, Allâh is All ­Strong, All ­Mighty</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span>. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat­ as­Salât [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al­ Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures). He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) explains in many Ayahs that the afflictions and exemplary punishments that befell the preceding nations, such as floods, devastating winds, the mighty shriek, and being swallowed up by the earth, and the like, were nothing more than the result of their Kufr and sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We sent Hâsib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lût (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As­-Saihah [torment ­ awful cry. (as Thamûd or Shu‘aib’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qârûn (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nûh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allâh Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised and Exalted) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> (See the Qur’ân Verse 35:45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah orders His Servants to turn to Him in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and supplicate to Him at the time of adversity, as He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful He (may He be Praised) &#8220;</span></strong> also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad ىلص ملـسو هـيلع اللها). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility). When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this glorious Ayah, Allah urges His Slaves and awakens in them the desire that, when they face adversities, such as illness, wounds, fighting, earthquakes, winds, storms, and other tribulations, they should humble themselves to Him in need of Him and ask for His Help. This is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)?</span></strong>&#8221; It asks why they (the preceding nations) did not turn to Allah humbly when they were inflicted with torment. Allah then tells that their hard­ heartedness and the handiwork of Satan, making evil deeds pleasing to them, prevented them from Tawbah, supplication, and beseeching forgiveness. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Rightly ­Guided Caliph, Amir Al ­Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers), ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul­‘Aziz (may Allah be merciful to him), when there was an earthquake during his era, wrote to his agents in the different countries and ordered them to tell the Muslims to make Tawbah to Allah, humble themselves to Him, and seek His Forgiveness from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All you Muslims know the different types of Fitan (trials) and calamities that prevail in our time, among which is the that the Kafirs have power over the Muslims in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, Palestine, Lebanon, Ethiopia, and other countries. There have also been earthquakes in Yemen and many countries; devastating floods, and violent hurricanes that have destroyed homes, trees, ships, and other properties; avalanches that have brought about incalculable harm; and famines and droughts in a multitude of countries. All this and much more are the different types of punishment that Allah afflicts upon His Servants due to their Kufr and misdeeds, deviation from His Obedience, zeal for this world and its transient pleasures, and turning away from the Hereafter and failing to prepare for it; except those to whom Allah has shown His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that all such adversities obligate Allah’s Servants to hasten to make sincere Tawbah to Him (may He be Praised) from all that He prohibited them from, to return to His Obedience, to rule according to the Shari‘ah (Islamic law), to cooperate in righteousness and piety, and advise one another to adhere to the truth and have patience. The moment the Servants repent to their Lord, humble themselves to Him, and hasten to do what pleases Him: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety)</span></strong> and enjoin one another to do good and forbid one another from evil, Allah will set their affairs aright and ward off the evil of their enemies, grant them authority in the land, give them victory over their enemies, bestow upon them His Blessings, and protect them from His Punishment. Allah, the Truest Speaker, says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good­ doers&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(commanding you)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding Grace to every owner of grace (i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving, physically and with his wealth, and even with good words). But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. the Day of Resurrection)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As­Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All­ Mighty, All­ Wise&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies in these Ayahs that His Mercy, Benevolence, Protection, and all His other Blessings are granted in full and shall continue to be given in the Hereafter to those who fear Him, believe in Him, obey His Messengers, hold fast to His Shar‘iah (Islamic Law), and make Tawbah to Him from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But for those who shun His Obedience, are too proud to fulfill the Rights owed to Him, and persist in their Kufr and disobedience, Allah (may He be Praised) threatens them with different punishments in this life and the Hereafter, and shall expedite the share of punishment which He has allotted for them (in this world. ed.), as His wisdom dictates, for them to be an example and warning to others. Allah (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. So the root of the people who did wrong was cut off. And all the praises and thanks are to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims! Call yourselves to account for your deeds, make Tawbah to your Lord, and seek His Forgiveness. Hasten to obedience and be on your guard against disobedience, and cooperate in righteousness and piety. Do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. Be just; indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. Make provision of righteous acts before death befalls you. Show mercy to the weak, help the poor, increase your Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), ask for His Forgiveness, enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil that you may receive mercy. Take admonition from what happened to the preceding nations due to their sins and misdeeds. Indeed, Allah accepts the Tawbah of the penitent, shows mercy to the doers of good, and grants a blessed end to the pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-­Muttaqûn (the pious) And He (Exalted be He) says: Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)</span></strong>. (See the footenote of V.9:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah with His Most Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to show mercy to the Muslims, grant them understanding of the Din (religion), give them victory over His and their enemies among the Kafirs and hypocrites, afflicting them with His Wrath that never will be turned back from the wrongdoers. He is the Guardian and the One Who is Capable of doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>yatawallaaka</em> (He befriend you) meaning that He take you as a friend (<em>walee</em>) through (His) love, granting of success and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author has begun by supplicating and asking Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Great Throne, to befriend the one who reads this book in this world and the Hereafter. As for befriending him in this worldly life, then it is by loving him, guiding him, directing him and assisting him. And as for befriending him in the Hereafter, then it is by showing him mercy and forgiveness, protecting him from the Hellfire and admitting him into Paradise. Then he also supplicates that he be blessed wherever he may be, and that Allaah make him fulfill the meaning of servitude, as well as its stations, which are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First: Being thankful for His Blessing</strong></span>. This is at the time when He gives it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Work you, O family of Dawood, with thanks!”</span> [Surah Saba: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you are grateful, He will be pleased therewith for you.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give thanks to Me and do not disbelieve.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being thankful for Allaah’s Blessing is shown through the heart by way of affirming, acknowledging and showing gratitude. And it is shown through the tongue by way of speaking about the blessing and praising it. And it is shown through the limbs by way of acting in accordance with what pleases Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Second: Being patient during tribulations</span>,</strong> hard times and with the things that one hates, which befall the people as a test and examination from Allaah. What is obligatory in these situations is that one have patience. Patience means suppressing the heart from being displeased and from despairing; suppressing the tongue from complaining; and suppressing the limbs from those acts that negate and contradict patience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And bear with patience whatever befalls you.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to those who are patient.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Third: Seeking forgiveness after committing a sin</strong></span>. This is since all of the Son of Aadam (i.e. humans) are sinners. But what is obligatory upon mankind when they should fall into sin is to rush to ask for forgiveness and repentance, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And those who when they commit some immoral act (i.e. fornication) or wrong themselves with evil, remember Allaah and so seek (His) forgiveness for their sins. And who is it that forgives sins except Allaah? And they do not persist knowingly in what sins they committed (after that).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the three characteristics: Being thankful for (Allaah’s) Blessing, being patient during times of tribulation, and seeking forgiveness after committing a sin. Whoever fulfills all of these will no doubt be from those who will experience happiness. In fact, happiness is linked to these three characteristics more than any others. All of them contain the meanings of Tawheed, submission, compliance and acceptance from Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Inaabah</em></strong><strong> (Turning Repentantly and Obediently) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>al-Inaabah </em>(turning repentantly and obediently) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So turn in repentance and obedience to your Lord and submit to Him </strong></span>[39:54]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>20</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>20</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Inaabah: </em>it means returning and it has the meaning of <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting), and repenting and <em>al-Inaabah </em>have one and the same meaning. However some of the scholars have said <em>al-Inaabah </em>is more specific than <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting), meaning it is more emphasized because it, <em>Inaabah</em> is <em>Tawbah</em> (repenting) but along with turning to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, meaning it is a specific repentance, and a person may repent and leave the sin and not return to it, and he may regret it, however his turning to Allaah may be a weak turning. Whereas <em>al-Inaabah </em>then indeed it means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>turning towards to Allaah</strong></span> the Mighty and Majestic. And therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So turn in repentance and obedience to your Lord and submit to Him …</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning turn back to Him and turn fully to Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped</strong> </span>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the punishment which destroys and annihilates comes, then repentance will not be accepted from those who repent at that time.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَوْلَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّا آمَنُوا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الْخِزْيِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for the people of Yunus when they believed, then we took away from them the humiliating punishment </strong></span>[10:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was an exception, otherwise when the punishment which destroys descends, then repentance is not accepted, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.. before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped</span> </strong>[39:54]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently), they have an appointed time and they have a limit, so repentance will not be accepted from the person who is experiencing the death rattle, or someone to whom death comes, and the repentance will not be accepted from one whom the punishment which destroys and annihilates descends upon. And repentance will not be accepted when the sun comes out from its place of setting before the establishment of the Hour. Repentance will not be accepted then. So therefore Allaah encourages the servant upon <em>at-Tawbah</em> (repenting) and <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently) before the time limit comes to its end.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنصَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Before the punishment comes to you and then you will not be helped </strong></span>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the witness is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Turn to your Lord repentantly and obediently</span> </strong>[39:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that <em>al-Inaabah</em> (turning repentantly and obediently) is a type from the types of worship because He said, “to your Lord”. So this shows that it is a type from the types of worship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">What should a servant do when he is tried with a sin and he repents from it with a repentence where these three affairs (conditions) are fulfilled. But (then) he struggles with his heart regarding that sin, only to find that he fell into it (again).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Abdirraheem al-Bukhaaree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah bless you. I say: a sincere tawbah (repentance) requires an effort. Now, there is no command or prohibition &#8211; as Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said &#8211; except that Shaytaan (the devil) has two incitements regarding it: either to extremism or to negligence. He (i.e. Shaytaan) doesn&#8217;t care by which of these two he becomes victorious [over the servant]! The important thing (to him) is that you leave the Straight Path. Also, from his ways is that he doesn&#8217;t want you to be steadfast upon tawbah. He doesn&#8217;t want this! Because if you &#8211; the one he (Shaytaan) led astray and made fall into sin &#8211; are steadfast upon sincere tawbah and you adhere to obedience, he (Shaytaan) loses! Right? And this makes him feel very outraged, because he swore by Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> (Iblees (Shaytaan)) said: &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your sincere slaves amongst them (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38: 82-83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah bless you. Shaytaan beautifies the sin, this is why it has been narrated in the two Saheehs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Paradise is surrounded by things which are disliked and Hellfire is surrounded by desires (temptations).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this affair requires one to strive hard!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our Paths.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29: 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you must show Allaah that you are truthful!! And this is a kind of test: you repent sincerely, and then the soul which commands evil entices you. So then you are in a struggle between your soul which commands evil and your self-reproaching soul. This is a test to see if your repentance is truthful, if your intention is correct and if you are sincere to Allaah in leaving [this sin]. Just as it is obligatory upon you to be sincere to Allaah in [performing] that which is commanded, it is also obligatory upon you to be sincere to Allaah in leaving [the prohibitions]. It is obligatory that you are sincere to Allaah in leaving [sins]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware, O beloved one! From the greatest means that lead to the servant being deprived of succes, is commiting sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We supplicate to the One Who is worshipped (Allaah) during every distress, then we forget Him when the distresses are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can we hope for an answer to our supplications, while we closed its path with sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I consider a man to have forgotten the knowledge that he learned because of a sin he commits.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Hilyah by Abu Nu&#8217;aym]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should beware! This is why the look is an arrow from the arrows of Iblees, so a person should not continue looking, [listening to] whisperings, [listening to] suggestions [of Shaytaan], listening or other than that. So the more a person continues, the more he increases, and it is feared for him that Raan will cover his heart, about which Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn. </strong>[83:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge with Allaah! So beware! Sins are dangerous, by Allaah, O brothers! Dangerous and significant! And do not belittle [sins] by saying: “This is an insignificant sin,” “Is it from the minor or major sins?” Beware! In al-Bukhaaree on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You people do (bad) deeds (commit sins) which seem in your eyes tinier than hair, while we used to consider those (very deeds) during the life-time of the Prophet as destructive sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trust me completely: Whenever you are truthful to Allaah in seeking refuge with Him and throwing yourself with humility before Him with repentance and returning back, He will make you steadfast, He will help you, He will give you success and He will take away from you the most evil of evils, the plot of the sinners and the most evil calamities of the day and night. But whenever you continue [listening to] whisperings and suggestions [of Shaytaan], Shaytaan will cause you to backslide. So beware!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, the fact that the servant always talks to himself (i.e. reviews himself), that he is aware that Allaah always watches over him in all of his deeds and movements and that he seeks nearness to Him by staying away from sins: this is a proof of his truthfulness, with the permission of Allaah. This heat that you feel because of this struggle in the inside, will result in coldness, certainty and security for you, if you are truthful to Allaah. This is why Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are truthful (in words and deeds). </strong>[9:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being truthful in words and deeds is a must! In words and deeds! And from the greatest of this, is that we are truthful to Allaah when we seek His forgiveness and when we return back to Him, the Majestic and Mighty! Is this clear, O brothers? So beware of continuing! Strive against your soul!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trust me completely: it is only a small amount of days. The Prophet &#8211; sallal-Laahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said, as mentioned in as-Saheeh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Victory is only an hour of patience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shaytaan requires struggle (Jihaad)! Right? He requires a great struggle! You have to struggle against him night and day! And the Prophet &#8211; sallal-Laahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam &#8211; has informed us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When any one of you goes to sleep, Shaytaan ties three knots at the back of his neck, and says: &#8220;You have a long night, so sleep.&#8221;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaytaan is with you! And he wages war against you from every place! It is not possible for you to be saved from him, except by seeking refuge with Allaah. This is why Allaah commanded you to seek help from Him and to seek refuge with Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of the daybreak.&#8221; </strong>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of mankind.&#8221; </strong>[114:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the noble, merciful Prophet &#8211; the one whom Allaah sent as a mercy to mankind &#8211; advised you, guided you, directed you and clarified to you the Path of salvation, which is adhering to the Sunnah:  the adhkaar (supplications) for the morning and the evening <strong>[1]</strong>, the adhkaar for entering and leaving the toilet, sleeping, eating, drinking, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Review yourself! I say: review yourself and examine yourself: are you from those who are steadfast upon the Sunnah or negligent regarding it? How should you call yourself to account except in this way? And praise and thank Allaah that you are alive! Praise and thank Allaah that you are alive! And I have mentioned this to the students and brothers, here or in a previous lesson &#8211; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How should this (calling oneself to account) happen? You have a notebook and a pen with you, and you want to know? Call yourself to account before you are called to account! You have a notebook with you [and you write]: Bismillaahi ar-Rahmaani ar-Raheem. Today, saturday or sunday. We start from Fajr; did you wake up before Fajr or after Fajr? [Mention this] to yourself, not in the radio! Did I wake up in time? Did I catch the Sunnah of Fajr or not? Of course before this [you mention]: have I prayed witr or not? Yes/no. Did I pray Fajr in congregation? Yes. Did I catch Takbeeratul-Ihraam? Yes/no. Have I said the adhkaar after the prayer <strong>[2]</strong>? Yes/no. The adhkaar for the morning and the evening? Yes/no. Did I recite my (daily) part of the Qur&#8217;aan? Etc, etc etc. Did I backbite? Have I commited something prohibited? Write down! You will see in the end of the day that you have [written] pages! Yes, no, yes, no&#8230; Review [yourself]!Yes: I stay upon the truth. No: review it the next day; are you still upon this or have you left it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, this affair is significant! It is not trivial!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>..in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years. </strong>[70:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, it is a must that we prepare an answer for this Day! We ask Allaah to be kind and gentle to us and you, to give us and you a good ending and to make us all steadfast upon Islaam and Sunnah. And may Allaah raise the rank of the Messenger of Allaah, his family and his Companions and grant them peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong> Authentic adhkaar for the morning and the evening</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2]</strong> Authentic adhkaar to be said after the obligatory prayer</p>

<p>AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book “Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah” (pg. 34-39)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Advice: Seeking Knowledge is the Foundation for the Correctness of your Repentance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge is the foundation for the correctness of your repentance. This is due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: For the most part, the misconceptions (you had prior to your repentance) will remain attached to your heart and your mind. So if you do not correct it with beneficial knowledge, you will find yourself accompanied by these misconceptions in your statements, actions and circumstances. Rather, you will find them mixed into your Da’wah (calling to the Way of Allaah), as is the condition of many of those who have leaped from (just) making their repentance to (being active in) the field of Da’wah. So they have begun calling to the Salafee Da’wah, however this call is mixed with the Ikhwaanee misconceptions of gathering people together (regardless of Creed) or the Qutubee misconceptions of making takfeer (declaring Muslims disbelievers) or the Surooree misconceptions of partisanship (hizbiyyah)! So the image displayed is Salafiyyah, but the taste and the smell derived from it is something else!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, their call turns into a Salafiyyah, which consists of particular standards that can have their roots traced back to the misconceptions they had propr to their repentance, which still accompany them and which they have not yet corrected. So you find this person calling to leadership in Da’wah (i.e. that there should be one leader for organizing all the Da’wah in a land).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that one rejects some of the principles of the Salafee Da’wah, claiming that they cause the hearts to be hardened! Or that they cause the brotherly ties to be broken! And this one agrees with the Qutubee ideologies!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one calls to Hizbiyyah (partisanship)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And this one carries ideas of instigation and provocation (of the masses)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one pitches the tent for gathering the people together (regardless of differences)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">All of this is done using the name of Salafiyyah, so to Allaah we turn for help! Verily to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Or perhaps you are carried away by the strong current of a misconception, such that your path and road towards repenting to Salafiyyah has changed course. So now you have become confused on this road or you begin calling to it, thinking that it is the truth when it is in fact misguidance!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many games do these individuals who claim to have knowledge and stand for Salafiyyah play with the youth who seek to repent to Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is due to nothing else except for their lack of seeking knowledge and their lack of asking questions from the people of knowledge from Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, may Allaah grant you success, you must seek beneficial knowledge, because it is that which will correct your repentance and set your path straight. With knowledge, you will free yourself from the misconceptions and the dangers, and you will save yourself from the hunting nets and snares, by the Will and Permission of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evidences that indicate the virtue of knowledge and those who possess it, then they are many and well known. I will mention from them, for the purpose of reminding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah bears witness that there is none that has the right to be worshipped but He. And so do the angels, and those having knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with Justice. None has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise</strong></span>.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.” [Surah Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah will raise in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been given knowledge.</span></strong>” [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s saying, reminding of the blessing He bestowed on His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) due to what He sent down to him from the Book (Qur’aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah) and protecting him from people misleading him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Had not the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy been upon you (O Muhammad), a party of them would certainly have made a decision to mislead you, but (in fact) they mislead none except their own selves, and no harm can they do to you in the least. Allaah has sent down to you the Book (Qur&#8217;aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah), and taught you that which you knew not. And Ever Great is the Grace of Allaah unto you.</strong></span>” [Surah An-Nisaa: 113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, when you come to know the importance and virtue of knowledge, and the danger of neglecting it, then know that the first thing you should start with from the various branches of knowledge is:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is required upon everyone that commits a sin to rush towards repenting from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance with regard to the <strong>rights of Allaah</strong> must meet three conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. One must stop committing that sin immediately,</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. He must feel remorse and sorrow for having done it, and</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>3. He must resolve to not return to committing that sin again.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance with regard to the <strong>rights of humans</strong> must meet these same three conditions (listed above), as well as a fourth one, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Taking back any oppression that was inflicted on someone or asking for his forgiveness or absolvment from that.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory on a person who has committed backbiting to seek repentance according to these four conditions, because backbiting involves the rights of people, so he must seek the forgiveness of the person he has backbitten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient for one to just say: &#8220;I have backbit you, so please absolve me from (this) sin&#8221; or must he inform him also of what he said about him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two views on this according to the Shaafi&#8217;ee scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First:</strong> His clarifying what he said (when backbiting) is a condition. So if he is absolved without informing him of what he said, the pardon is not valid, just as if he were to absolve him from (stealing) unidentifiable money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second:</strong> His informing him (of what he said) is not a condition, because this is something that one will not be able to tolerate and thus forgive. So his knowing (exactly what was said) is not a condition, contrary to the example of the (stolen) money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first opinion is the strongest, since people have the ability to grant forgiveness for certain types of backbiting but not other types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if the one who has been backbitten is either dead or absent, then one is excused from seeking to be absolved from it. However, the scholars say: He should supplicate much for that person and ask forgiveness for him, as well as do many good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is preferable for the one who has been backbitten to absolve the backbiter from his sin, but it is not an obligation on him to do so. This is because it is giving away and forfeiting one’s right, so the choice is his. However, it is strongly recommended (muta’akkidah) for him to absolve him so that his Muslim brother can be free from the harm of this sin and so that he can be successful in receiving Allaah’s great reward of Forgiveness and Love. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those who repress their anger and pardon people. Verily, Allaah loves the good doers.”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 134]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proper way he should take in making himself allow the pardoning is by reminding himself that: “This matter has already happened and there is no way to remove it now. So it is not right for me to make him miss his chance of getting reward and absolving my Muslim brother.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives (others), that is truly from the things recommended by Allaah.”</span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Show forgiveness!”</span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 199]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ayaat similar to what we mentioned above are many. And in the authentic hadeeth, the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “And Allaah remains in the assistance of (His) servant so long as the servant remains in the assistance of his (fellow) brother.”</span> [Saheeh – Reported by Muslim (2699)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;<em>Whosoever is sought to be pleased, yet is not pleased is a devil</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the past would recite:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It was said to me: Such and such person has spoken badly of you And when a youth sets out to humiliate, it is a shame So I said: He has come to us and issued an excuse The blood-money (i.e. recompense) for a sin – to us – is the apology.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what we have mentioned here concerning the encouragement for one to absolve and forgive a person from backbiting is what is correct. As for what has been reported on Sa&#8217;eed bin Al-Musayyib that he said: “I will not forgive the one who has oppressed me” and on Ibn Sireen that he said: “I will not forbid it on him and then make it allowable for him, because Allaah has made backbiting forbidden on him and I will never make permissible what Allaah has made forbidden” then it is either unauthentic or erroneous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since a person that pardons someone is not making something forbidden permissible. Rather, he is only forfeiting a right that is established for him. The texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah indicate clearly that it is recommended to forgive and forfeit one’s rights, which are specific to this case. Or perhaps Ibn Sireen&#8217;s words can be taken to mean: “I will never permit myself to be backbitten.” This would be correct, for indeed if a person says: “I seek my honor back from the one who backbitten me”, he is not allowing for it to be done. Rather, he is forbidding everyone from backbiting him, just as he forbids others from being backbitten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth: “Are you not able to be like Abu Damdam – when he would go out from his home, he would say: ‘I am giving my honor away in charity for the people.’” Meaning: I will not seek justice from those who oppress me whether in this world or the Hereafter. This is useful in removing a transgression that existed before the absolvement, but as for what occurs after it, there must be a new absolvement made after that. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi -Rahimullaah-<br />
Translated by Umm Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed a slave commits a sin and enters Paradise through committing it and he performs a good deed and enters the Hellfire through performing it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked ‘How is this (possible)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A sin is committed and thus does not cease to be before his eyes (causing him to be) fearful of it, concerned about it frightened and weeping due to his regret of doing it. Feeling ashamed due to this action before his Lord The Most High, with his head lowered between his hands, and his heart broken and despondent due to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore that sin will be more beneficial to him than numerous acts of obedience could be. As a consequence these previously mentioned matters are the cause for this slave of Allaah’s happiness and success until that sin will be a reason for him to enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A slave of Allaah performs a good deed and he continues to view it as if he has performed a favour for his Lord and is egotistic due to that good deed, and he is conceited, vain and arrogant due to the sin. So he says I did such and such action (boasting) causing to him to inherit the characteristic of pride, haughtiness and adopting an overbearing attitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This becomes the reason for his destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if Allaah Ta’ala intends good for the needy slave He trials him with something in order to bring him down and to lower his neck in humiliation and to decrease his importance to himself. However if Allaah intended for him (the slave) anything other than good He (Allaah) would have left him alone and his vanity and pride and this is the deception which necessitates his destruction.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Waabil as-Sayyib min Kalim at-Tayyib’ By Ibn al-Qayyim page 15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Repentance: Means turning back from disobeying Allaah to obeying Him</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Repentance: Is beloved to Allaah</span></strong>, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allaah loves those who repent and those who purify themselves.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 222]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Repentance: Is an obligation on every believer.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allaah in sincere repentance!&#8221;</span> </strong>[Surah At-Tahreem: 8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Repentance: Is from the means of attaining success. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And O believers, all of you, repent to Allaah in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah An-Noor: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Success is when someone gets what he is looking for and is saved from what he is running from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Through Sincere Repentance: Allaah forgives sins no matter how big they are and no matter how many they are. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (because of sins), do not despair from the mercy of Allaah. Verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Verily, He is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span></strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my brother who has fallen into sins, do not despair from the mercy of your Lord, for indeed the door to repentance is open until the sun rises from the west. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allaah extends His hand out at night in order to accept the repentance of the sinner by day. And He extends His hand out during the day in order to accept the repentance of the sinner by night, until (the day) when the sun will rise from its west.&#8221;</strong> [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how many people have repented to Allaah from numerous and enormous sins and Allaah has accepted their repentance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And those who do not supplicate to another god along with Allaah, nor do they kill a person that Allaah has made forbidden (to kill) except with just cause, nor do they commit fornication. And whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection and he will abide therein in disgrace. Except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds. And Allaah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span></strong> [Surah Al-Furqaan: 68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sincere Repentance: Must meet five conditions (in order to be accepted)</strong></span>, which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Sincerity to Allaah, the Most High: This is by the person doing it only for the sake of Allaah and seeking His reward and salvation from His punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Remorse: for the sin that was committed, such that he is sad he did it and wishes he had never done it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ceasing: to commit the sin immediately. If the sin was against Allaah, then he should (1) stop doing it if it was an unlawful act, or (2) hasten to do it if it was an obligation that he abandoned doing. And if the sin was against a created being (such as humans), then he should hasten to free himself from it, whether by returning it back to him or seeking his forgiveness and pardon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Determination: to not go back to doing that sin again in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The repentance should not occur before the time when its acceptance is terminated, either by death or by the sun rising from the west. Allaah says: &#8220;Repentance is of no effect for those who commit sins constantly until when death faces one of them, he says: Verily I repent now.&#8221; The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: &#8220;Whoever repents before the sun rises from its west, Allaah will accept his repentance.&#8221; [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, grant us the sincere repentance and accept it from us, verily You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 2<br />
Repentance</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars said: It is necessary to repent from every sin. If the offense involves the Right of Allah, not a human, then there are three condition to be met in order that repentance be accepted by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- To desist from committing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- To feel sorry for committing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- To decide not to recommit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any repentance failing to meet any of these three conditions, would not be sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if the sin involves a human&#8217;s right, it requires a fourth condition, i.e., to absolve onself from such right. If it is a property, he should return  it to its rightful owner. If it is slandering or backbiting, one should ask the pardon of the offended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also repent from all sins. If he repents from some, his repentance would still be sound according to the people of sound knowledge. He should, however, repent from the rest. Scriptural proofs from the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars support the incumbency of repentance.</p>

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another version of Muslim, he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a person who has his camel in a waterless desert carrying his provision of food and drink and it is lost. He, having lost all hopes (to get that back), lies down in shade and is disappointed about his camel; when all of a sudden he finds that camel standing before him. He takes hold of its reins and then out of boundless joy blurts out: &#8216;O Allah, You are my slave and I am Your Rubb&#8217;.He commits this mistake out of extreme joy&#8221;.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>19.</b> Zirr bin Hubaish reported: I went to Safwan bin `Assal  (May Allah be pleased with him) to inquire about wiping with wet hands over light boots while performing Wudu&#8217;. He asked me, &#8220;What brings you here, Zirr?&#8221; I answered: &#8220;Search for knowledge&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Angels spread their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of  joy for what he seeks&#8221;. I told him, &#8220;I have some doubts in my mind regarding wiping of wet hands over light boots in the course of performing Wudu&#8217; after defecation or urinating. Now since you are one of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), I have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concerning it?&#8221;. He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). In other cases such as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands over light boots will suffice.&#8221; I, then, questioned him, &#8220;Did you hear him say anything about love and affection?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a journey when a bedouin called out in a loud voice, `O Muhammad.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied him in the same tone,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Here I am.</span>&#8216; I said to him (the bedouin), `Woe to you, lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.&#8217; He said, `By Allah! I will not lower my voice,&#8217; and then addressing the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) he said, `What about a person who loves people but has not found himself in their company.&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `On the Day of Resurrection, a person will be in the company of those whom he loves.</span>&#8216; The Messenger of Allah then kept on talking to us and in the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Sufyan, one of the narrators of this tradition, said: &#8220;This gateway is in the direction of Syria. Allah created it on the day He created the heavens and the earth. It is open for repentance and will not be shut until the sun rises from that direction (i.e., the West) (on Doomsday)&#8221;.<br />
[At-Tirmidhi, who categorised it as Hadith Hasan Sahih]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>20</b>. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Prophet of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There was a man from among a nation before you who killed ninety-nine people and then made an inquiry about the most learned person on the earth. He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred. He then asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the affirmative and asked, `Who stands between you and repentance? Go to such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place.&#8217; So he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The angels of mercy pleaded, &#8216;This man has come with a repenting heart to Allah,&#8217; and the angels of punishment argued, &#8216;He never did a virtuous deed in his life.&#8217; Then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them. He said, `Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.&#8217; They measured and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another version:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was found to be nearer to the locality of the pious by a cubit and was thus included among them&#8221;.</span> Another version says:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah commanded (the land which he wanted to leave) to move away and commanded the other land (his destination) to draw nearer and then He said: &#8220;Now measure the distance between them.&#8217; It was found that he was nearer to his goal by a hand&#8217;s span and was thus forgiven&#8221;.</span> It is also narrated that he drew closer by a slight movement on his chest<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>21.</b> Abdullah bin Ka`b, who served as the guide of Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) when he became blind, narrated: I heard Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) narrating the story of his remaining behind instead of  joining Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he left for the battle of Tabuk. Ka`b said: &#8220;I accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle of Tabuk and the battle of Badr. As for the battle of Badr, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of the Quraish. Allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. I had the honour of being with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on the night of `Aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was dearer to me than participating in the battle of Badr, although Badr was more well-known among the people than that. And this is the account of my staying behind from the battle of Tabuk. I never had better means and more favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. And by Allah, I had never before possessed two riding-camels as I did during the time of this expedition. Whenever Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) decided to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the last moment (of departure). But on this expedition, he set out in extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual position so that they should make full preparation for the campaign. And the Muslims who accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) at that time were in large number but no proper record of them was maintained<span style="color:#800000;">.</span>&#8221; Ka`b (further) said: &#8220;Few were the persons who chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves (and thus remain undetected) unless Revelation from Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious (revealed relating to them). And Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was sought. I had a weakness for them and it was during this season that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Muslims made preparations. I also would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but would come back having done nothing and said to myself: &#8216;I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like&#8217;. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out along with the Muslims, but I had made no preparations. I would go early in the morning and come back, but with no decision. I went on doing so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. Then I wished to march on and join them. Would that I had done that! But perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) whenever I went out, I was grieved to find no good example to follow but confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom Allah had exempted (from marching forth for Jihad). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made no mention of me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting with the people in Tabuk, he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `What happened to Ka`b bin Malik?&#8217;</span> A person from Banu Salimah said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an appreciation of  his finery have detained him.&#8217; Upon this Mu`adh bin Jabal (MatAllah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;By Allah, we know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), however, kept quiet. At that time he (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) saw a person dressed in white and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Be Abu Khaithamah.</span>&#8216; And was Abu Khaithamah Al-Ansari was the person who had contributed a Sa` of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.&#8221; Ka`b bin Malik further said: &#8220;When the news reached me that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was on his way back from Tabuk, I was greatly distressed. I thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger the next day. In this connection, I sought the counsels of every prudent member of my family. When I was told that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas vanished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing but the truth could save me. So I decided to tell him the truth. It was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) arrived in Al-Madinah. It was his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go to the mosque and perform two Rak`ah (of optional prayer) and would then sit with the people. When he sat, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. They were more than eighty in number. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to Allah, until I appeared before him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He then said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Come forward&#8217;.</span> I went forward and I sat in front of him. He said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride?&#8217;</span> I said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and I have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware that if I were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you, Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. In case, I speak the truth, you may be angry with me, but I hope that Allah would be pleased with me (and accept my repentance). By Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind.&#8217; Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;This man spoke the truth, so get up (and wait) until Allah gives a decision about you.&#8217;</span> I left and some people of  Banu Salimah followed me. They said to me, `By Allah, we do not know that you committed a sin before. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) like those who stayed behind him. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would have sought forgiveness for you.&#8217; By Allah, they kept on reproaching me until I thought of going back to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and retract my confession. Then I said to them, &#8216;Has anyone else met the same fate?&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes, two persons have met the same fate. They made the same statement as you did and the same verdict was delivered in their case.&#8217; I asked, `Who are they?&#8217; They said, &#8216;Murarah bin Ar-Rabi` Al-`Amri and Hilal bin Umaiyyah Al-Waqifi.&#8217; They mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I was confirmed in my original resolve. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited the Muslims to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in fact the same atmosphere of which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent (most of their) time weeping. As I was the youngest and the strongest, I would leave my house, attend the congregational Salat, move about in the bazaars, but none would speak to me. I would come to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as he sat amongst (people) after the Salat, greet him and would ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings. Then I would perform Salat near him and look at him stealthily. When I finish my Salat, he would look at me and when I would cast a glance at him he would turn away his eyes from me. When the harsh treatment of the Muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, I walked and I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin, and I had a great love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not answer to my greeting. I said to him, `O Abu Qatadah, I adjure you in the Name of Allah, are you not aware that I love Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8217; I asked him the same question again but he remained silent. I again adjured him, whereupon he said, `Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) know better.&#8217; My eyes were filled with tears, and I came back climbing down the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As I was walking in the bazaars of Al-Madinah, a man from the Syrian peasants, who had come to sell food grains in Al-Madinah, asked people to direct him to Ka`b bin Malik. People pointed towards me. He came to me and delivered a letter from the King of Ghassan, and as I was a scribe, I read that letter whose purport was: `It has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) was treating you harshly. Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place; so come to us and we shall receive you graciously.&#8217; As I read that letter I said: &#8216;This is too a trial,&#8217; so I put it to fire in an oven. When forty days had elapsed and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) received no Revelation, there came to me a messenger of the Messenger of Allah and said, `Verily, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has commanded you to keep away from your wife.&#8217; I said, `Should I divorce her or what else should I do?&#8217; He said, `No, but only keep away from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.&#8217; The same message was sent to my companions. So, I said to my wife: &#8216;You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case.&#8217; The wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umaiyyah is a senile person and has no servant. Do you disapprove if I serve him?&#8217; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `No, but don&#8217;t let him have any sexual contact with you.</span>&#8216; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no such desire left in him. By Allah, he has been in tears since (this calamity) struck him.&#8217; Members of my family said to me, `You should have sought permission from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in regard to your wife. He has allowed the wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah to serve him.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I would not seek permission from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for I do not know what Messenger of Allah might say in response to that, as I am a young man&#8217;. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty days had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to us. After I had offered my Fajr prayer on the early morning of the fiftieth day of this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had sat in the very state which Allah described as: `The earth seemed constrained for me despite its vastness&#8217;, I heard the voice of a proclaimer from the peak of the hill Sal` shouting at the top of his voice: &#8216;O Ka`b bin Malik, rejoice.&#8217; I fell down in prostration and came to know that there was (a message of) relief for me. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had informed the people about the acceptance of our repentance by Allah after he had offered the Fajr prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my companions in order to give them the glad tidings. A man spurred his horse towards me (to give the good news), and another one from the tribe of Aslam came running for the same purpose and, as he approached the mount, I received the good news which reached me before the rider did. When the one whose voice I had heard came to me to congratulate me, I took off my garments and gave them to him for the good news he brought to me. By Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) except these garments, at that time. Then I borrowed two garments, dressed myself and came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) On my way, I met groups of people who greeted me for (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: &#8216;Congratulations for acceptance of your repentance.&#8217; I reached the mosque where Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was sitting amidst people. Talhah bin `Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me, shook hands with me and greeted me. By Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the Muhajirun besides him.&#8221; Ka`b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talhah. Ka`b further said: &#8220;I greeted Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) with `As-salamu `alaikum&#8217; and his face was beaming with pleasure. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Rejoice with the best day you have ever seen since your mother gave you birth.</span> &#8216;I said: `O Messenger of Allah! Is this (good news) from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `No, it is from Allah.</span>&#8216; And it was common with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) that when ever he was happy, his face would glow as if it were a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognized it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said, I have placed a condition upon myself that if Allah accepts my Taubah, I would give up all of my property in charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)!&#8217; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Keep some property with you, as it is better for you.&#8217;</span> I said, &#8216;I shall keep with me that portion which is in Khaibar&#8217;. I added: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and therefore, repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long as I am alive.&#8221; Ka`b added: &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone among the Muslims who has been granted truthfulness better than me since I said this to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). By Allah! Since the time I made a pledge of this to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), I have never intended to tell a lie, and I hope that Allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the rest of my life. Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious, revealed these Verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8216;Allah has forgiven the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), the Muhajirun (Muslim Emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar (Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the time of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three who did not join [the Tabuk expedition and whose case was deferred (by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) for Allah&#8217;s Decision] till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His Pardon [repent (unto Him)]. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in word and deeds).&#8221;</span> (9:117,118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Ka`b said: &#8220;By Allah, since Allah guided me to Islam, there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who had told lies, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else, as He sent down the Revelation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"> They will swear by Allah to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijsun [i.e., Najasun (impure) because of their evil deeds], and Hell is their dwelling place &#8211; a recompense for that which they used to earn. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are Al-Fa&#8217;siqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)&#8221;.</span> (9:95,96)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Ka`b further added: &#8220;The matter of the three of us remained pending for decision apart from the case of those who had made excuses on oath before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he accepted those, took fresh oaths of allegiance from them and supplicated for their forgiveness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept our matter pending till Allah decided it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> The three whose matter was deferred have been shown mercy.</span> The reference here is not to our staying back from the expedition but to his delaying our matter and keeping it pending beyond the matter of those who made their excuses on oath which he accepted&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another version adds: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out for Tabuk on Thursday. He used to prefer to set out on journey on Thursday.&#8221; Another version says: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to come back from a journey in the early forenoon and went straight to the mosque where he would perform two Rak`ah prayer. Afterwards he would seat himself there&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>22.</b>  Imran bin Al-Husain Al-Khuza`i (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman from the tribe Juhainah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while she was pregnant from (Zina) adultery and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have committed an offense liable to Hadd (prescribed punishment), so exact the execution of the sentence.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called her guardian and said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Treat her kindly. Bring her to me after the delivery of the child.&#8221;</span> That man complied with the orders. At last the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded to carry out the sentence. Her clothes were secured around her and she was stoned to death. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led her funeral prayers. `Umar submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! She committed Zina and you have performed funeral prayer for her?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, she made repentance which would suffice for seventy of the people of Al-Madinah if it is divided among them. Can there be any higher degree of  repentance than that she sacrificed her life voluntarily to win the Pleasure of Allah, the Exalted?&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>23.</b> Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a son of Adam were to own a valley full of gold, he would desire to have two. Nothing can fill his mouth except the earth (of the grave). Allah turns with mercy to him who turns to Him in repentance&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>24.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, smiles at two men, one of them killed the other and both will enter Jannah. The first is killed by the other while he is fighting in the Cause of Allah, and thereafter Allah will turn in mercy to the second and guide him to accept Islam and then he dies as a Shaheed (martyr) fighting in the Cause of Allah.&#8221;</span><br />

He then climbed upon the third mound but did not see anything until he came back to the place where he had been previously. And as he was sitting (in utter disappointment) there came to him the camel, till that (camel) placed its nosestring in his hand.

A person came there and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have committed an offence which deserves the imposition of hadd upon me, so impose it upon me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept silent. He repeated it and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have committed an offence which deserves the imposition of hadd upon me, so impose it upon me. He (the Holy Prophet) kept silent, and it was at this time that Iqama was pronounced for prayer (and the prayer was observed). And when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had concluded the payer that person followed Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Abu Umama said: I too followed Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) after he had concluded the prayer, so that I should know what answer he would give to that person. That person remained attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have committed an offence which deserves imposition of hadd upon me, so impose it upon me. Abu Umama reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Didn&#8217;t you see that as you got out of the house, you performed ablution perfectly well. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, of course. I did it. He again said to him: Then you observed prayer along with us. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes, it is so. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: Verily, Allah has exempted you from the imposition of hadd, or he said. From your sin.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There was a person before you who had killed ninety-nine persons and then made an inquiry about the learned persons of the world (who could show him the way to salvation). He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: No. He killed him also and thus completed one hundred. He then asked about the learned persons of the earth and he was directed to a scholar, and he told him that he had killed one hundred persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: Yes; what stands between you and the repentance? You better go to such and such land; there are people devoted to prayer and worship and you also worship along with them and do not come to the land of yours since it was an evil land (for you). So he went away and he had hardly covered half the distance when death came to him and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment. The angels of mercy said: This man has come as a penitant and remorseful to Allah and the angels of punishment said: He has done no good at all. Then there came another angel in the form of a human being in order to decide between them. He said: You measure the land to which he has drawn near. They measured it and found him nearer to the land where he intended to go (the land of piety), and so the angels of mercy took possession of it. Qatada said that Hasan told him that it was said to them that as death approached him, he crawled upon his chest (and managed) to slip in the land of mercy.</p>

He came to a monk and asked him about that, and he said: There is no chance for repentance for you. He killed the monk also and then began to make an inquiry and moved from one village to another village where there lived pious persons, and as he had covered some distance, he was overtaken by death, but he managed to crawl upon his chest (to the side nearer to the place where the pious men lived). He died and then there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment and (when it was measured) he was found to be nearer to the village where pious persons were living equal to the Space of a span and he was thus included among them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihab reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made an expedition to Tabuk and he (the Holy Prophet) had in his mind (the idea of threatening the) Christians of Arabia in Syria and those of Rome. Ibn Shihab (further) reported that &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b informed him that Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b who served as the guide of Ka&#8217;b b. &#8216;Malik as he became blind that he heard Ka&#8217;b b. Malik narrate the story of his remaining behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from the Battle of Tabuk. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik said: I never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and that of the Battle of Badr. So far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Muslims (did not set out for attack but for waylaying) the caravan of the Quraish, but it was Allah Who made them confront their enemies without their intention (to do so). I had the honour to be with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the night of &#8216;Aqaba when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was more dear to me than my participation in the Battle of Badr, although Badr was more popular amongst people as compared with that (Tabuk). And this is my story of remaining back from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk. Never did I possess means enough and (my circumstances) more favourable than at the occasion of this expedition. And, by Allah, I had never before this expedition simultaneously in my possession two rides. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out for this expedition in extremely hot season; the journey was long and the land (which he and his army had to cover) was waterless and he had to confront a large army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual situation (they had to face), so that they should adequately equip themselves for this expedition, and he also told them the destination where he intended to go. And the Muslims who accompanied Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) at that time were large in numbers but there was no proper record of them. Ka&#8217;b (further) said: Few were the persons who wanted to absent themselves, and were under the impression that they could easily conceal themselves (and thus remain undetected) until revelations from Allah, the Exalted and Glorious (descended in connection with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on an expedition when the fruits were ripe and their shadows had been lengthened. I had weakness for them and it was during this season that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made preparations and the Muslims too along with them. I also set out in the morning so that I should make preparations along with them but I came back and did nothing and said to myself: I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) until people were about to depart and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out and the Muslims too along with him, but I made no preparations. I went early in the morning and came back, but I made no decision. I continued to do so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. I also made up my mind to march on and to meet them. Would that I had done that but perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as I went out amongst people, I was shocked to find that I did not find anyone like me but people who were labelled as hypocrites or the people whom Allah granted exemption because of their incapacity and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took no notice of me until he had reached Tabuk. (One day as he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk) he said: What has happened to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik? A person from Banu&#8217; Salama said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the (beauty) of his cloak and his appreciation of his sides have allured him and he was thus detained. Mua&#8217;dh b. Jabal said: Woe be upon that what you contend. Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, we know nothing about him but good. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, kept quiet. It was during that time that he (the Holy Prophet) saw a person (dressed in all white (garment) shattering the illusion of eye (mirage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May he be Abu Khaithama and, lo, it was Abu Khaithama al-Ansari and he was that person who contributed a sa&#8217; of dates and was scoffed at by the hypocrites. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik farther said: When this news reached me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was on his way back from Tabuk I was greatly perturbed. I thought of fabricating false stories and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger on the following day. In this connection, I sought the help of every prudent man from amongst the members of my family and when it was said to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to arrive, all the false ideas banished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing could save me but the telling of truth, so I decided to speak the truth and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) arrived (in Medina). And it was his habit that as he came back from a journey he first went to the mosque and observed two Rak&#8217;ahs of nafl prayer (as a mark of gratitude) and then sat amongst people. And as he did that, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him and they were more than eighty persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their secret (intentions) to Allah, until I presented myself to him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He (the Holy Prophet) then said to me: Come forward. I went forward until I sat in front of him. He said to me: What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, if I were to sit in the presence of anybody else from amongst the worldly people I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext (or the other) and I have also the knack to fall into argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware of the fact that if I were to put forward before you a false excuse to please you Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me, and if I speak the truth you may be annoyed with me, but I hope that Allah would make its end well and, by Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind you (failed to join the expedition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This man told the truth, so get up until Allah gives a decision in your case. I stood up and some people of Banu&#8217; Salama followed me in hot haste, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know about you that you committed a sin prior to this. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as those who stayed behind him have put forward excuses. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would have sought forgiveness for you. By Allah, they continued to incite me until I thought of going back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and contradict myself. Then I said to them: Has anyone else also met the same fate? They said: Yes, two persons have met the same fate as has fallen to you and they have made the sane statement as you have made, and the same verdict has been delivered in their case as it has been delivered in your case. I said: Who are they? They said: Murara b. ar-Rabi&#8217;a &#8216;Amiri and Hilal b. Umayya al-Waqafi. They made a mention of these two pious persons to me who had participated in the Battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I went away when they named these two persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the Nluslims to talk with three of us from amongst those (persons) who had stayed behind him. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us underwent a change and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned (hostile) against us and it was in fact the same atmosphere ot which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves withen their houses and spent (most of the) time in weeping, but as I was young and strong amongst them I got (out of my house), participated in congregational prayers, moved about in the bazar; but none spoke to me. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he sat amongst (people) after the prayer, greeted him and asked myself whether his lips stirred in response to my greetings (or not).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I observed prayer beside him and looked at him with stealing glances and when I attended to my prayer, he looked at me and when I cast a glance at him he turned away his eyes from me. And when the harsh treatment of the Muslims towards me extended to a (considerable) length of time, I walked until I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada, and he was my cousin, and I had the greatest love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not respond to my greetings. I said to him: Abu Qatada, I adjure you by Allah, arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again repeated saying: I adjure you by Allah. arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again adjured him, whereupon he said: Allah and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) are best aware of it. My eyes began to shed tears and I came back climbing down from the wall and as I was walking in the bazar of Medina a Nabatean from amongst the Nabateans of Syria, who had come to sell foodgrains in Medina, asked people to direct him to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik. People gave him the indication by pointing towards me. He came to me and delivered to me a letter of the King of Ghassan and as I was a scribe I read that letter and it was written like this:&#8221; Coming to my point, it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Holy Prophet) is subjecting you to cruelty and Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place, so you come to us that we should accord you honour. As I read that letter I said: This is also a calamity, so I burnt it in the oven. When out of the fifty days, forty days had passed and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) received no revelation, there came the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to me and said: Verily, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has commanded you to remain separate from your wife. I said: Should I divorce her or what (else) should I do? He said: No, but only remain separate from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same message was sent to my companions. So I said to my wife: You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case. The wife of Hilal b. Umayya came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, Hilal b. Umayya is a senile person, he has no servant. Do you disapprove of my serving him? He said: No, but don&#8217;t go near him. She said: By Allah, he has no such instinct in him. By Allah, he spends his time in weeping from that day to this day. Some of the members of my family said to me: Were you to seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in regard to your wife as he has granted permission to the wife of Hilal b. Umayya to serve him. I said: I would not seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), for I cannot say what Allah&#8217;s Apostle may say in response to seeking my permission. Moreover, I am a young man. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty nights had passed that (people) had observed boycott with us. It was on the morning of the fiftieth night that I observed my dawn prayer and was sitting on one of the roofs of our houses. And I was in fact sitting in that very state which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has described about us in these words:&#8221; Life had become hard for myself and the earth had compressed despite its vastness,&#8221; that I heard the noise of an announcer from the peak of the hill of Sal&#8217; saying at the top of his voice: Ka&#8217;b b. Malik, there is glad tidings for you. I fell down in prostration and came to realise that there was (a message of) relief for me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed the people of the acceptance of our repentance by Allah as he offered the dawn prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my friends in order to give them the glad tidings and a person galloped his horse and came from the tribe of Aslam and his horse reached me more quickly than his voice. And when he came to me whose sound I heard, he gave me the glad tidings. I took off my clothes and clothed him with them because of his bringing good news to me and, by Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) than these two on that occasion, and I asked one to lend me two clothes and dressed myself in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on my way I met groups of people who greeted me because of (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: Here is a greeting for you for your repentance being accepted by Allah. (I moved on) until I came to the mosque and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been sitting there amongst persons. So Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me and he shook hands with me and greeted me and, by Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the emigrants except he. Ka&#8217;b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talha. Ka&#8217;b further said: I greeted Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikam and his face was glistening because of delight, and he said: Let there be glad tidings and blessings for you, the like of which (you have neither found nor you will find, as you find today) since your mother gave your birth. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. is this acceptance of repentance from you or from Allah? He said: No, (it is not from ma), it is from Allah, and it was common with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that as he was happy his face brightened up and it looked like a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognised it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, am I allowed to give in charity my wealth for Allah&#8217;s sake and for the sake of His Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Keep some property with you as it is better for you. I said: I shall keep with me that part (of my property) which fell to my lot (on the occasion of the expedition of) Khaibar. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of truth and, therefore, (I think) that repentance implies that I should not speak anything but truth as long as I live. He said: By Allah, I do not know whether anyone amongst the Muslims was put to more severe trial than I by Allah because of telling the truth. And since I made a mention of this to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) up to this day I have not told any lie and, by Allah, I have decided not to tell a lie and I hope that Allah would save me (from trials) for the rest of my life and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed these verses:&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, Allah has turned in Mercy to the Prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate; then He turned to them in mercy. Surely, to them He is Compassionate, Merciful and (He turned in Mercy) to the three who were left behind until the earth despite its vastness became strait for them and their souls were also straitened to them.&#8221; And this revelation reached up to the (words):&#8221; O you who believe, develop God consciousness, and be with the truthful&#8221; (ix. 117-118). Ka&#8217;b said: By Allah, since Allah directed me to Islam there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who told lies, for in regard to those who told lies Allah used harshest words used for anyone as He descended revelation (and the words of Allah are):&#8221; They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are unclean and their resort is Hell, recompense for what they earned. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people&#8221; (ix. 95-96). K&#8217;ab said that the matter of us three persons was deferred as compared with those who took an oath in the presence of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and Allah did not give any decision in regard to us. It was Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Who gave decisions in our case, three who remained behind. (The words of the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221; the three who were left behind&#8221; do not mean that we remained back from Jihad but these imply that He kept our matter behind them who took oath and presented excuse before Him. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

He said: I heard my father Ka&#8217;b b. Malik, and he fas one of those three whose repentance was accepted (by Allah). He transmitted that He never lagged behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition that he undertook except two expeditions; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the tradition narrated through another chain of transmitters the words are:&#8221; That Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on an expedition with a large number of persons more than ten thousand and this could not be recorded in the census register.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="037.6673"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. Musayyib, &#8216;Urwa b. Zubair, &#8216;Alqama b. Waqqas and &#8216;Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. &#8216;Utba b. Mas&#8217;ud&#8211;all of them reported the story of the false allegation against &#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). And they (the slanderers) said what they had to say, but Allah exonerated her of this charge and all of them reported a part of the hadith and some of them who had better memories reported more and with better retention, and I tried to retain this hadith (listening) from every one of them that they reported to me and some of them attested the other. (The sumaried substance of the false allegation is this): &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) intended to set out on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and he took one with him in whose favour the lot was cast. It so happened that he cast lots amongst us while setting out on a battle and it was cast in my favour, so I set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). This relates to the period when the revelation concerning the commands of veil had been made. I was carried in a haudaj and I was brought down where we had to stay. In short, when we set out for return journey from the expedition and our caravan was near Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded one night to march forward. I also got up when the command for the march was given and moved on until I went out of the encampments of the army and after relieving myself I came to my place. I touched my chest and found that my necklace which had been made of the stones of zafar had been broken. I retraced my steps and tried to search my necklace and this detained me there. The group of people who saddled my ride and placed my haudaj carrying me upon the camels marched on. They were under the impression that I was in it. The women in those days were light of weight and they did not wear much flesh, as they ate less food; so they did not perceive the weight of my haudaj as they placed it upon the camel as I was a young girl at that time. So they drove the camel and Eet out and I found my necklace after the army had marched. I came to my place and there was none to call and none to respond (the call).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I waited at my place under the impression that when the people would riot find me they would come back. So I kept sitting at my place. I was overpowered by sleep and slept. Safwan b. Mu&#8217;attal Sulami Dhakwini, who had lagged behind the army because of taking rest came to my place walking in the latter part of the night and he saw the body of a person who was asleep. He came to me and recognised me as he had seen rue before it was enjoined to observe purda. I got ap by his voice as he recited Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#8217;un [we are for Allah and to Him we have to return. ] and I covered my head with my headdress. By Allah, he did not speak to me a word and I did not hear a word from him except Inna lillahi. He made his camel kneel down and I amounted the camel as he pressed tLe camel&#8217;s foreleg and he moved on leaning the camel by the nose string on which I was riding until we came to the army where it had encamped for rest because of extreme heat. Woe be upon those who harboured doubts about me and the most notorious among them was &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy, the great hypocrite. We came to Medina and I fell sick for a month. The people had been deliberating over the statements of those who had brought these calumnies against me. I was absolutely unaware of anything concerning that. This, however, caused doubt in my mind that I did not see Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him.) treating me with such kindness with which he treated me as I fell ill before this. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would coome and greet me with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikum and only ask me how I was. This caused doubt in my mind, but I was unaware of the evil. I wept outside despite my failing health and there went along with me Umm Mistah and she said the daughter of Abu Rhm b. Muttalib b. &#8216;Abd Manaf and his mother was the daughter of Sakhr b. &#8216;Amir, the sister of the mother of Abu Bakr Sidiq and his son was Mistah b. Uthatha b. &#8216;Abbad b. Muttalib. I and the daughter of Abu Rahm set towards the direction of my house. Something got into the head dress of Umm Mistah and she said: Woe be upon Mistah. And I said. Woe be upon what you say. Do you curse people who had participated in Badr? She said: Innocent woman, have you not heard what he said? I said: What did he say? She conveyed to me the statement of those who had brought false allegations against me. So my illness was aggravated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to my house and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to me and he greeted me and then said: How is that woman? I said: Do you permit me to go to the (house) of my parents? She (further) said: I had at that time made up my mind to confirm this news from them. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted me. So I came to (the house of) my parents and said to my mother: Mother, do you know what the people are talking about? She said: My daughter, you should not worry. By Allah, if there is a handsome woman who is loved by her husband and he has co-wives also they talk many a thing about her. I said: Hallowed be Allah, what are the people talking about? I wept during the whole night until it was morning and I did not have a wink of sleep and I wept even in the morning. As the revelation was delayed (in regard to this matter), so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali ibn Abi &#8216;Talib and Usama b. Zaid in order to seek their advice in regard to the separation of his wife. Usama b. Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be apen him) about the innocence of his wives and what he knew about his love for them. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, they are your wives and we know nothing else about thembut goodness. And as for &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, he said: Allah has not put any unnecessary burden upon you (in regard to your wives). There are a number of women besides her and if you ask that maidservant (Barira) she will tell you the truth. So, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called Bailra and said: Barira, did you see anything in &#8216;A&#8217;isha which can cause doubt about her? Barira said: By Him Who sent thee with the truth, I have seen nothing objectionable in her but only this much that she is a young girl and she goes to sleep while kneading the flour and the lamb eats that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) mounted the pulpit and sought vindication against &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul, and he further said: Who would exonerate me from imputations of that person who has troubled (me) in regard to my family? By Allah, I find nothing in my wife but goodness and the person whom the people have mentioned in this connection is, according to my knowledge, a thoroughly pious person, and he did never get into my house but along with me. Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I defend your honour against him. If he belong to the tribe of Aus we would strike his neck and if he belongs to the tribe of our brother Khazraj and you order us we would comply with your order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up. He was chief of the Khazraj tribe. He was otherwise a pioas man but he had some what tribal partisanship in him and he said to Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh: By the everlasting existence of Allah. you are not stating the fact, you will not be able to kill him and you will not have the power to do so. Thereupon, Usaid b. Hudair stood up, and he was the first cousin of Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh and said to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada: By the everlasting existence of Allah, you are not stating the fact. We would kill him. You are a hypocrite and so you argue in defence of the hypocrites, and thus both the tribes Aus and Khazraj were flared up, until they were about to fall upon one another and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept standing upon the pulpit and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tried to subside their anger until they became silent and thus there was silence. &#8216;A&#8217;isha further reported: I spent the whole day in weeping and even the night and could not have a wink of sleep even next night. My parents thought that this constant weeping of mine would break my heart. I wept and they sat beside me. In the meanwhile a woman of the Ansar came to see me. I permitted her to see me and she also began to weep. And we were in this very state that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he greeted me and then sat down. He had never sat with me since a month when this rumour was afloat, and there was no revelation (to clarity) my case. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited Tashahhud (there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said: Coming to the point, &#8216;A&#8217;isha, this is what has reached me about you and if you are innocent, Allah would Himself vindicate your honour, and if accidentally there has been a lapse on your part sock forgiveness of Allah; He will pardon thee for when a servant makes a confession of his fault and turns (to Him) penitently, Allah also turns to him (mercifully) accepting his repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked, my tears dried up and not even a single drop of tear was perceived by me (rolling out of my eyes). I said to my father: You give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf. He said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I then said to my mother: Give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf, but she said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I was a small girl at that time and I had not read much of the Qur&#8217;an (but I said): By Allah, I perceive that you have heard about this and it has settled down in your mind and you have taken it to be true, so if I say to you that I am quite innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would never believe me to be true, and if I confess to (the alleged) lapse before you, whereas Allah knows that I am completely innocent (and I have not committed this sin at all), in that case You will take me to be true and, by Allah, I, therefore, find no other alternative for me and for you except that what the father of Yousuf said:, (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought for in that (predicament) which ye describe&#8221; (xii 18). After this I turned my face to the other side and lay down on my bed. By Allah, I was fully aware of this fact that I was innocent but I did not expect that Allah would descend Wahy Matlu (Qur&#8217;anic Wahy) in my case as I did not think myself so much important that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would speak in this matter in words to be recited. I only hoped that Allah would in vision give an indication of my innocence to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) during his sleep. And, by Allah, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not moved an inch from where he had been sitting and none from the members of my family had gone that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, descended revelation upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) there and then and he felt the burden which he used to feel at the time of receiving revelation. He began to perspire because of the burden of words of Allah as they descended upon him even during the winter season and there fell the drops of his sweat like silvery beads. When this state of receiving revelation was over, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) smiled and the first words which he spoke to me were that he said: &#8216;A&#8217;isha, there is glad tidings for you. Verily, Allah has vindicated your honour, and my mother who had been standing by me said: Get up (and thank him, i. e. the Holy Prophet). I said: By Allah, I shall not thank him and laud him but Allah Who has descended revelation vindicating my honour. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed:&#8221; &#8216;Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you&#8221; (and) ten (subsequent) verses in regard to my innocence. She further said: Abu Bakr used to give to Mistah (some stipend) as a token of kinship with him and for his poverty and he (Abu Bakr) said: By Allah, now I would not spend anything for him. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: It was upon this that Allah the Exalted and Glorious revealed this verse:&#8221; And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear to give to the near of the kin&#8221; up to&#8221; Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you?&#8221; Hibban b. Musa&#8217; said that &#8216;Abdullah b. Mubarak used to say: It is a verse contained in the Book which most (eminently) brightens the hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I wish that Allah should pardon me. I shall never stop this stipend. So he continued to give him the stipend which he had withdrawn. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) asked Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), about me what she knew or what she had seen in me, and she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I shall not say anything without hearing (with my ears) and seeing with my eyes. By Allah, I find nothing in her but goodness. (And she stated this in spite of the fact) that she was the only lady who amongst the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) used to vie with me but Allah saved her in bringing false allegation against me because of her God-consciousness. Her sister Hamna bint Jahsh, however, opposed her and she was undone along with others.</p>

Give me an advice about them who have brought false charge about my family. By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too. And he never entered my house but in my presence and when I was away on a journey, he remained with me even in that. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this change that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to my house and asked my maidservant and she said: By Allah, I know no fault in her but this that she sleeps, and goat comes and eats the kneaded flour. Some of the Companions (of the Holy Prophet) scolded her and said: State the fact before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and they even made a pointed reference (to this incident). She said: gallowed be Allah. By Allah, I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news reached the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah. By Allah, I have never unveiled any woman. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: He fell as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and there is this addition in this hadith that the people who had brought false allegation amongst them were Mistah and Hamna and Hassan. And so far as the hypocrite &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy is concerned, he was one who tried his best to gather the false news and then gave them the wind.

<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Remembrance  of Allah, Supplication, Repentance and Seeking Forgiveness (Kitab Al-Dhikr) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous  outpourings of man&#8217;s heart before his Lord, but it is an expression of his sense of  nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His mercy, grace and  blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he supplicates about,  and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his  soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before  its Creator. The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality  of the faith that is imprinted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his  thought and activity. Thus to understand the spirit of any religion and appraise its value  to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The Prophet (may peace be upon him)  was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made supplications to his Lord with  zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. One who  cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great  Master, his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine  Mercy and unflinching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before  Him. These are in fact the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a  Muslim has been instructed to make whether singly or in congregation, whether at the  appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden call or urge to His Lord, reflects the  one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. Whatever is the state of  spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly in his  mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the  supplications in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal  name of God, i. e. Allah, is used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called  out in order to make the worshipper conscious of his own weak and dependent self before  his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help and grant him what he desires, and at  the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself through the realisation of what  God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own inner life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality  a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, it covers the whole range of human life with all  its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds expression in a deep and urgent  longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive situation, forgiveness  of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Hereafter.  This consciousness of one&#8217;s absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man&#8217;s attitude of perfect  resignation before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the  spirit of despondence and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that  the Being Who is the Lord of man&#8217;s fate can also help him and save him even in the most  trying circumstances. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him)  eminently combine in themselves the mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim  supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undisturbed with concentrated gaze one Supreme  Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of all values. But, unlike mystics,  he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself but realises  himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and  unwavering confidence in God. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications  taught by Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit  of social fellowship. They do not urge man to stand face to face with God in absolute  loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein the suppliant begs his Lord with  the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling that the distress which  vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the salvation  for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity.  There is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in  these supplications, but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which  the soul is supposed to be unified with God losing all its individual identity. Here the  soul has a communion with Allah with full consciousness of man&#8217;s own self, his social  surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the supplications have been  expressed in the form&#8221; We&#8221; and Us&#8221;. </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Did you    supplicate for anything or beg of Him about that? He said: Yes. I used to utter (these    words): Impose punishment upon me earlier in this world, what Thou art going to impose    upon me in the Hereafter. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Hallowed be Allah, you have neither the power nor forbearance to take upon yourself (the    burden of His Punishment). Why did you not say this: O Allah, grant us good in the world    and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of Fire. He (the Holy Prophet)    made this supplication (for him) and he was all right.</font></p>

He (the Lord) would say:    Against what do they seek protection of Mine? They (the angels) would say: Our Lord, from    the Hell-Fire. He (the Lord) would say: Have they seen My Fire?

He would say: I grant pardon to them, and confer upon them what    they ask for and grant them protection against which they seek protection. They (the    angels) would again say: Our Lord, there is one amongst them such and such simple servant    who happened to pass by (that assembly) and sat there along with them (who had been    participating in that assembly).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Ad-Dawah ilaLlaah Magazine Vol 1 , Issue 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b>Tawbah</b> (Repentance) in Arabic literally means &#8216;to return&#8217;. In an Islamic context, it refers to the act of leaving what Allaah has prohibited and returning to what He has commanded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of repentance is one which concerns all people who believe in God, and is vital one for the Muslims to understand because our salvation in the hereafter is dependent on our repentance to Allaah, as is shown by Allaah&#8217;s order:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;AND TURN YOU ALL TOGETHER IN REPENTANCE TO ALLAAH O BELIEVERS, THAT YOU MAY BE SUCCESSFUL&#8221; [An-Noor (24):31]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Soorah al-Baqarah, Allaah tells us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;SURELY ALLAAH LOVES THOSE WHO TURN UNTO HIM IN REPENTANCE AND LOVES THOSE WHO PURIFY THEMSELVES.&#8221; [2:222]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows how pleasing our repenting is to Allaah. Also, the Prophet, Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam gave us an example of just how pleasing to Allaah our repenting is an authentic hadeeth in which he, (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah is more delighted with the repentance of His servant than one of you would be, who suddenly finds his camel laden with supplies after losing it in a barren land&#8221; (1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Try to imagine your joy if you were to suddenly retrieve everything you ever possessed after losing all hope of recovering what you had lost. Then think that Allaah&#8217;s delight is even greater than this when His slave repents to Him. So much so, that if man stopped repenting to Allaah, He would replace us with another creation that would turn to Him for forgiveness. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you did not commit sins, Allaah would sweep you out of existence and replace you by another people who would commit sins, ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and He would forgive them.&#8221; (2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The problem with many of us today, is that we don&#8217;t fear Allaah, which means that we don&#8217;t think twice about disobeying Him and therefore falling into sin, which we give no real tought to. So perhaps we should think about the statement which Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (3) radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu, made: &#8220;A believer sees his sins as if he were sitting under a mountain which he is affraid may fall on him, whereas the wicked person considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like this (and he moved his hand over his nose in illustration).&#8221; (4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NEVER DESPAIR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone might say, &#8216;I want to repent but my sins are too many.&#8217; But Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;SAY: O MY SLAVES WHO HAVE TRANSGRESSED AGAINST THEMSELVES! DESPAIR NOT FOR THE MERCY OF ALLAAH, VERILY ALLAAH FORGIVES ALL SINS. TRULY HE IS OFT FORGIVING, MOST MERCIFUL.&#8221; [Az-Zumar (39):53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we should never lose hope or stop asking for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness. Its importance is shown to us in a hadeeth in which the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O people! Turn to Allaah in repentance and seek His forgiveness, for surely I make repentance a hundred times every day.&#8221; (5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance is such a great act of worship that doing it can totally erase our sins altoghether, as the Prophet, Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;One who repents from sin is like one without sin.&#8221; (6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>ONLY ALLAAH CAN FORGIVE SINS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forgiveness for our sins is not something that comes automatically, it is something that must be sought sincerely and with consciousness. Also we should remember that it is only through Allaah&#8217;s Mercy that anyone will ever enter Paradise. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) advised: &#8220;Do good deeds properly, sincerely and moderately, and rejoice, for no one&#8217;s good deeds will put him in Paradise.&#8221; The Companions asked, &#8220;Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; He replied. &#8220;Not even me unless Allaah bestows His pardon and mercy on me.&#8221; (7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore in Islaam, salvation rests on faith (which includes), good actions and hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy, all combined in truly unique manner which is not found in any other religion or system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is only Allaah who can forgive our sins and He is not in need of any intercessor. The proof for this is in a du&#8217;aa (supplication) which the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) taught his closest Companion Abu Bakr(8):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allaah, truly I have wronged myself and none can forgive sins except you.&#8221; (9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is a complete waste of time asking forgiveness from the people such as &#8220;saints&#8221;, pious people or even the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam). Allaah say in reply to people who do such things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;VERILY, THOSE YOU CALL UPON BESIDES ALLAAH, ARE ONLY SLAVES LIKE YOURSELVES.&#8221; [a;-A&#8217;raaf (7):194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important that we never despair of Allaah&#8217;s Mercy &#8211; no sin is too great to repent for&#8230; or too little for that matter. As one of the salaf (Pious predecessors) said: &#8220;Do not look at the insignifance of your sins, but consider the greatness of The One you are disobeying.&#8221; (10)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young man, nineteen years of age, and have involved myself in a great deal of sin. Even to the extent that I do not pray most of my Prayers in the mosque, and I have never completely fasted the month of Ramadaan in my entire life. Besides these, I have committed other sins as well. I have vowed to repent many times before, however, after doing so I lapse back into these same sins. The youths of my area are just as bad, as are the friends that I associate with. And Allaah knows that I have transgressed against myself and that whenever I repent, I return back to the same sins. I hope that you may direct me to a path that will bring me closer to my Lord and distance me from these evil actions of mine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: Allaah &#8211; the Might and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Say O My Slaves who have transgressed against their own souls! Do not despair of Allaah&#8217;s mercy. Indeed Allaah forgives all sins, Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:53]. There is a consensus from the Scholars that this noble <i>aayah</i> (verse) was revealed for the <i>taa&#8217;ibeen</i> (those who repent). So whoever sincerely repents from his sins, then Allaah will forgive him all his sins, as occurs in the saving of Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; : <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Turn to Allaah in sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord may remove from you your sins and admit you into Paradise beneath which rivers flow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tahreem 66:8]. So in this <i>aayah</i> (verse), Allaah has made the removal of sins and entry into Paradise dependant upon sincere repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincere repentance is conditional upon: [i] abandoning the sin and keeping away from it, [ii] having regret and remorse for committing the sin, [iii] truly intending not to commit the sin again, [iv] remembering the greatness of Allaah and hoping for His reward, whilst fearing His punishment. Another condition for sincere repentance is that if due to transgression, the wealth or property of someone has been stolen or usurped, then it must be returned or forgiveness must be sought from the one whose wealth, blood or honour has been taken. However, if the honour of a person has been violated and the situation is such that it is not possible to seek that persons forgiveness, then plenty of <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) should be made for his welfare and he should be spoken good of in those places where he had previously been backbitten, since good deeds wipe away bad ones. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Turn you all in repentance to Allaah, O Believers, in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:31]. So in this <i>aayah</i> (verse) Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; linked success with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance) and points to the fact that the repentant person will reach success and happiness, and if such a person were to follow up this repentance with <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and doing righteous actions, then Allaah would efface his evil actions and change them to good actions, as Allaah the Most Perfect &#8211; said after mentioning the sins of Shirk (directing worship that is due only for Allaah to other than Allaah), taking a life without just cause and fornication and adultery-: <b>&#8220;And whoever does this, will receive the punishment, The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgement and he will live therein in disgrace. Except for those who repent, have <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and do righteous actions. For them Allaah will change their evil deeds into good ones, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Furqaan 25:68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the causes of <i>tawbah</i> (repentance) are humility and submissiveness to Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and asking Allaah for guidance and ability, and that acceptance of one&#8217;s repentance is considered as a Favour from Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8216;<b>&#8216;Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60] And He &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And when My servant asks you concerning Me, say to them that I am indeed near, And I respond to the supplication of the one who supplicates to Me.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:186]. Also, from the causes of <i>tawbah</i> is choosing good companionship and friendship and following them in righteous conduct, whilst staying clear of bad companionship. It is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallaallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;A person is upon the way of life of his friend, so let one of you look to whom he keeps as a friend.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallaallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>also said:<i> &#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk, then either he will grant you some, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i>3</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Khutbatul Haajah…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who forgives the sins, alhamdulillaah! The one who accepts the repentance. I testify that Allaah alone deserves to be worshipped, subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. He is the most Generous and He is the o­ne who bestows upon us at-Taubah, repentance. Repentance is the task of the entire life. It is the beginning and the end of slave worship. It is the first station of the station of slavery to Allaah. It is its middle and it is its end. Our need for it is very great because we sin a lot and we become negligent concerning the right of Allaah upon us. Day and night we go through heedlessness. So we need that which polishes the hearts &amp; purifies it from the accumulation of sins and disobedience and their stains. Tauba is to abandon the sin knowing its ugliness. With regards to doing it we should be determined not to return to indulge in it out of love, sincerity and hope for reward from Allaah fearing the punishment and that to be before examining death and before the sun rises from the West. This is the Tauba. Allaah opens its doors and promises to accept it irrespective of how major or how many sins there may be. Allaah says: &#8216;Turn ye unto obedience and repentance with true faith to your Lord and submit to Him in Islaam before the torment comes upon you, then you will not be helped.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &#8216;And it is He who accepts repentance from His slaves and forgives sins and He knows what you do.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says : &#8216;And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, he will find Allaah Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful – subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said concerning the Christians in (Surah Maidah 5: 73–74) urging them to repent : Surely, disbelievers are those who said: &#8220;Allaâh is the third of the three (in a Trinity).&#8221; But there is no ilâh (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but o­ne Ilâh (God -Allâah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall the disbelievers among them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he urged them to repent to Him and said: &#8216;Will they not repent to Allâh and ask His Forgiveness? For Allâh is Oft­ Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many of us use this verse when we give Dawah to the Christians in particular when they nullify what Allaah nullifies from trinity. How many of us think about verse 74? &#8216;Will they not repent to Allâaah and ask His Forgiveness? For Allâh is Oft­ Forgiving, Most Merciful.Giving them hope, giving them glad tidings that Allaah forgives this great error of theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah spoke concerning the people of the Ditch Surah Burooj (85:10) – &#8216;Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women (by torturing them and burning them), and then do not turn in repentance, (to Allâah), will have the torment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the burning Fire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Hasan al Basri (Rahimahullah) said : Look to this great generosity of Allaah. They killed His friends whilst He calls them to repent and ask His forgiveness.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah warns us none should despair of His Mercy in (Surah Zumar : 39-53) &#8211; Say: &#8220;O &#8216;<i>Ibâdî</i> (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allâah, verily Allâah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas (may Allaah be pleased with him) commented saying : &#8216;anyone who despairs the slaves of Allaah after the revelation of the above verse, then he has denied the Book of Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the merits of Tauba,  its secrets &amp; its blessings, then these are numerous and diverse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tauba calls to success. Tauba leads to happiness. Tauba expiates sins &amp; if it is perfected it changes the sins into good deeds. And when a slave turns in repentance to Allaah it is o­ne of the most beloved acts of worship to Allah and Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala is pleased with the tauba of those asking for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sal allaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) said in the hadith reported by Bukhari &amp; Muslim : &#8216;A believer sees his sins as if he is sitting under a mountain which he is afraid may fall o­n him. Whereas an evil, wicked doer considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Masud added Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sal allaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) said: Allaah is more pleased with the repentance of his slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized. But he has his riding animal carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes to find his riding animal gone. He starts looking for it and suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allaah wished him to suffer from. He then says: &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again. Then when he wakes up, he raises his head to find his riding animal standing beside him. So imagine his happiness. Allaah said in the beginning here that Allaah is more pleased with the repentance of his slave than the situation of pleasure that this person experiences after he was saved from death. Such pleasure was not mentioned concerning other worships, (meaning other than the tauba) and know that this pleasure has a profound influence o­n the status of the o­ne who repents and o­n his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the merits of Tauba is that : through its great influence o­n the stations of uboodiyah, brings forth love, kindness, softness, mildness, gratitude to Allaah, praise of Him, being pleased with Him, enjoying his many blessings. And from its merits &#8216;humbleness.&#8217; – humility of the heart, submissiveness to Allaah. And this is more beloved to Allaah than many of the apparent actions. Although the apparent actions may be more in quantity and quality than the slavery of repentance. Why? Because humility &amp; humbleness is the spirit of worship and its essence. That&#8217;s why Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala is with the broken hearts, the humble o­nes to Him, &amp; that&#8217;s why He subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala is most near to His slave when he is in the position of humbleness &amp; humility – and that is the prostration. Because this is the station of humility. And this may be the secret behind the response of Allaah to the invocation of the oppressed, the invocation of the traveler &amp; to the invocation of the fasting person. Because of the humility in their hearts. The anguish of the oppressed causes the broken heart. Similarly the traveler finds broken heartedness (humility) when he travels to strange places. Similarly in a fasting person, it breaks the animalistic drive for lust &amp; desires as Imaam Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullah) discussed. Despite the greatness of tauba and its great blessings there are however mistakes made by many people regarding tauba. And that is due to ignorance or negligence and his heedlessness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these mistakes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1)<i>Delaying repentance</i> : In this case the person should repent for his sins &amp; from his delay in repenting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2)<i>Paying no attention to Tauba</i>: paying no attention to those sins the person may not know that he had committed. Because there are secret sins that are hidden &amp; there are sins that the person is ignorant of. There is no salvation from this except through a general tauba : from that which he knows &amp; from that which he doesn&#8217;t know. And that&#8217;s why the Prophet (salallaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) said that shirk in this ummah is more hidden &amp; concealed than the creeping of ants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) asked Prophet (salallaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) how we could we rid ourselves from this. He (salallaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) said: reciting</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Supplication for fear of shirk : (Quoted by Bukhari)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Allaah, I take refuge in You lest I should commit shirk with You knowingly and I seek Your forgiveness for what I do unknowingly.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3)From the mistakes is to abandon tauba fearing that o­ne may return to the sin again or fearing from criticism by others or fearing to go to a lower rank &amp; losing prestige &amp; fame. This is a mistake that should be avoided. Thus the person should be determined to repent. And if he returns to the same sin, let him renew the tauba o­ne more time &amp; so o­n if it recurs. And let him realize that if he repents Allaah will compensate him with good for that which he abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4)Widening the extent of the sin depending o­n the Mercy of Allaah and this is grave error. Why because, we know &#8216;Yes&#8217; that Allaah is the Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful but we also know that He is severe in punishment. Allaah says: and never will his wrath be turned back from the people who are criminals, sinners etc. So the person has to remember this as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5)Repentance of the liars: those who abandon the sins temporarily due to sickness, accidents or other reasons, due to fear or hoping for some prestige. Whenever they get the opportunity, they return to the sins. This is the tauba of the kazzabeen – the repentance of the liars. It is not a true tauba. Not including of course in this the type of people who may think of committing a sin (his self invites/incites him to commit a sin) or that shaytaan deceived him &amp; made him commit it. Then he regrets it and he repents. This is a true repentance. Also NOT included are thoughts &#8212; as long as they are thoughts and not materialized into action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6)The delusion concerning the respite (an interval of rest or relief / a period of temporary delay) which Allaah gives to the wrongdoers. This turns people off from tauba. And that&#8217;s why the Prophet (salallaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) said: that if you see Allaah giving His slaves from the bounties in this life whilst he is sinning, He gives him what he likes – then this is a gradual attraction to punishment. Then the Prophet (salallaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) recited the saying of Allaah from Surah al-An&#8217;am:44 &#8216;So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. (This is reported by Imaam Ahmed &amp; the men of narration are trustworthy.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who does evil will be recompensed for. And maybe that the sinner thinks his body is safe &amp; then thinks that there is no punishment while his heedlessness concerning the fact that he will be punished if he does not repent in itself is a punishment. Ibn al-Jawzi (rahimahullaah) said: What is incumbent upon the intellectual (a person who has sound intellect) is to be cautious concerning his sins because its fire is under the ashes, and may be that the punishment is delayed due to the clemency of Allaah &amp; may be it comes speedily. A person of sound intellect, when he commits a sin will hasten to repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7)From the mistakes concerning repentance is the despair from the Mercy of Allaah &amp; the despair from repentance. Some people when they indulge in excessive sins and they repent o­nce or twice, then they return to the sin o­nce more &amp; thereafter they return to the sin over and over again, they despair from the Mercy of Allaah. And this is a grave error. Because none despairs from the mercy of Allaah except the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala to assist us to be from those who repent sincerely to Him and may He, the Most High accept our repentance. Walhamdulillaahi rabbil Aalameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source : Nur `Ala Al-Darb Fatwas , alifta.net</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q62: I would like to perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from envying others. I am trying to get rid of this quality as hard as I can, but Satan often tempts me to do this through jealousy. If I become jealous of my colleagues or other women, I begin to envy them. A friend told me, &#8220;Suppress your jealousy and envy inside your heart, and don&#8217;t talk about it, so Allah will not punish you for it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A62: Yes, it is true, if you feel something you should try to struggle against yourself and suppress your feelings, and do not do anything contrary to the Shari`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Do not try to harm the person that you envy, whether by actions or by words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Ask Allah to remove this from your heart so it will not harm you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; If one person envies another, but they do not act upon it, it will not harm them if they do not harm the person they envy, take their blessing from them, or speak ill about them. If it is something that is in their mind and they suppress it, it will not cause them any harm. However, they should be careful to avoid saying or doing anything to harm the person they envy. It was narrated the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said,<a>Avoid envy, as envy devours good deeds just as a fire devours fuel. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Envy is a malicious thing that harms the one who feels it before it harms others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Believers should beware of this and ask Allah for protection. They should supplicate to Allah to remove this from their hearts, until there is nothing left of it. And, whenever they feel anything like it, they should struggle against themselves to suppress it and keep it inside their hearts, without hurting the person they envy, whether by actions or by words. And may Allah help us all!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Repenting from all sins but keeping the ill-gotten money</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 6: A person used to abandon Salah (prayer), drink alcohol and commit vile deeds. He has a lot of ill-gotten money. He then turned to Allah with sincere repentance with regard to all the sins mentioned above except the ill-gotten money. Should he get rid of such ill-gotten money? Or will he be treated like a new Muslim who is not asked about the source of his wealth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: on turning to Allah with sincere repentance with regards to the ill-gotten money, it is obligatory for one to get rid of such evil money. In case he is not able to define the ill-gotten money, he can give out what he thinks to clear himself from such guilt. This is to be followed if his sins have not caused him to leave Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On committing sins that make a person leave Islam such as the abandonment of Salah, according to the most preponderant opinion of scholars, even if such a person does not deny its obligation, repentance can be realized by performing Salah and embracing Islam again. This is because Islam wipes out all that has gone before it. <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Also, one is not obliged to get rid of the money he got before adopting Islam. This is because Allay (Exalted be He) says about the disbelievers, Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven</span></strong>. As mentioned in the Sahih (Authentic Book of Hadith), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). And penitence also wipes out all that has gone before it.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: When I was a young man, I committed some sins. Alhamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah], for having guided me to make Tawbah (repentance to Allah). However, I still have doubts about whether Allah has accepted my Tawbah or not. Kindly enlighten me regarding Salat-ul-Tawbah (Prayer of Repentance). May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Alhamdu lillah, Tawbah wipes out all one&#8217;s past sins. Therefore, you should give up your doubts that Allah has turned your Tawbah away. Rather, you have to expect good from your Lord and have firm belief that He has accepted your heartfelt Tawbah. This is based on the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) in which Allah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful</strong> </span><br />
(Surah Al-Nur, 24: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah, Allah has made success contingent upon making Tawbah. Anyone who turns in Tawbah to Allah, will achieve success. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنِّي لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا ثُمَّ اهْتَدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them,</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (till his death)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. </span></strong>(Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 82)</p>
<p>Allah is the Ever-Truthful Who never breaks His Promises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا تُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَّصُوحًا عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُكَفِّرَ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)</span> </strong>(Surah Al-Tahrim, 66: 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah Allah&#8217;s Promise, as indicated by the words &#8220;It may be &#8230;&#8221;, should be understood to mean that He will surely fulfill His Promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you have to expect good from Allah and assume that He has accepted your Tawbah provided that you are sincere and full of remorse for committing these past sins. You also have to be determined not to return to doing them again. You have to be aware of incitements of Satan. In one Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I am near to the thought of My Servant as he thinks about Me.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you ought to have firm belief that Allah has accepted your Tawbah. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Let none of you die without expecting good from Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted)</strong> (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith)<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#008000;text-decoration:underline;"><br />
</span></span><span style="color:#993300;">As for Salat-ul-Tawbah, it was authentically reported on the authority of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anyone who commits a sin, performs Wudu&#8217; (ablution) properly, and then offers two Rak&#8217;ahs (units of Prayer) wherein he asks Allah to forgive his sins, Allah will accept his Tawbah</strong>. (Related by Ahmad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s strive to be close to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s long for the dwelling of peace wherein there is no toil, stress or weariness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The easiest way is to consider the fact that you are passing a period that lies between two other periods, namely your current life, which is the present one and it is between your past and your future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The past can be set aright through repentance, regret and asking the forgiveness of Allah, and this is a way, which affords you no toil, weariness or hard work, as it is concerned with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The future can be set aright by abstaining from misdeeds, and this is a means of comfort and relief for you, for it is not a difficult act, but it is an intention that relieves your body, heart, and your mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, your past is set aright through repentance; your future is set aright through abstention, determination and intention, which have nothing to do with overburdening the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, our concern here is with the present time as it stands between the two other periods. If you waste it, then you are wasting your happiness and salvation. On the contrary, if you maintain it through setting your past and present aright, indeed you will attain success, salvation, relief, and pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Improving your present state is much more difficult than setting your past and your future aright, because it means that you should abide by the most deserving and beneficial deeds to achieve happiness. There are great differences between people in this regard. This is your chance to take the provision for your Hereafter, either Paradise or Hellfire. So, if you take this path to your Lord, you will attain glorious happiness and great success during this short period of time which has no value compared with eternity. However, if you prefer vain desires, idleness, play and amusement, the period would pass quickly, followed by a permanent and great pain, the suffering of which is much more severe than the suffering of patience, the patience required to obey Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A righteous man was once asked to tell the story of the pivotal moment of his life, the moment in which he first began to apply the teachings of Islam, and the following was his answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was a young man, I would not hesitate to perpetrate any sin that was made available to me. Then, one day, I saw a young woman who was perhaps the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Much tempted by her, I indicated to her that I wanted her to approach me. She seemed nervous, but I thought that she would probably agree to satisfy my sexual desires for money. She approached me with what seemed to be a great deal of trepidation, and when she actually stood before me, she looked extremely terrified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Feeling sorry for her, I said, &#8216;Do not fear, for I will not harm you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But my words did not lessen her terrible fright in the least; in fact, her situation worsened. She began to tremble like a palm tree leaf trembles with the wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;Tell me your story.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8216;By Allah, o my brother, never before this day have I offered my body in this way. Dire need is what has driven me to this, for I have three daughters who have not eaten a single morsel of food for three days now. It was pity for them that brought me to this low point in my life.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first time in my life, I felt pity; her story moved me, and I no longer entertained the intention of taking advantage of her. After she told me where she lived, I took a great deal of money, clothing and food to her house. When I returned to my house, I told my mother what had happened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother knew that I had a book in which I would record all of my evil deeds, and so she said to me, &#8216;My son, you are a man who has never performed a good deed except for the good deed that you performed today. I know that you have a book in which you record your evil exploits, go now and write in it your good deed.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I stood up, went to my book, opened it, and found that all of its pages were blank- except for the first page on which was written a single line.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ الْحَسَنَاتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّيِّئَاتِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hud : 114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At that very moment, I raised my hands to the sky and said, &#8216;By your Might and Majesty, never again will I disobey You.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>al-Fawaa’id, pp 151-152, Al-Istiqaamah, No. 2</strong></p>
<div>Your life in the present moment is in between the past and the future.</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has preceded can be rectified by tawbah (repentance), nadam (regret) and istighfar (seeking Allaah’s forgiveness). And this is something that will neither tire you, nor cause you to toil as you would with strenuous labour. Rather it is an action of the heart.Then as regards the future (then it can be corrected) by withholding yourself from sins. And this abandonment is merely the leaving of something and to be at ease from it. This also is not action of the limbs, which requires you to strive and toil. Rather this is a firm resolve and intention of the heart – which will give rest to your body, heart and thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for what has preceded, then you rectify it with repentance. And as for the future – then you rectify it with firm resolve and intention. Neither of these involves any hardship or exertion of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then your attention must be directed to your life in the present &#8211; the time between two times. If you waste it, then you have wasted the opportunity to be of the fortunate and saved ones. If you look after it, having rectified the two times – what is before and after it, as we have said – then you will be successful and achieve rest, delight and ever-lasting bliss. However, looking after it is harder than that which comes before and after it, since guarding it involves keeping to that which is most befitting and beneficial for your soul, and that which will bring it success and well-being.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A burglar scaled the wall of Maalik bin Dinar&#8217;s house one night and easily managed to get inside. Once inside the house, the thief was disappointed to see that there was nothing inside actually worth stealing. The owner of the home was inside at the time, he was busy performing prayer. Realizing that he was not alone, Maalik quickly ended his prayer and turned around to face the thief. Without showing any sign of being shocked or afraid, Maalik calmly extended greetings of peace and then said, &#8220;My brother, may Allah forgive you. You entered my home and found nothing that is worth taking, yet I do not want you to leave my home without taking away some benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stood up, went to another part of the room, and came back with a jug full of water. He looked into the eyes of the burglar and said, &#8220;Make ablution and perform two units of prayer, for if you do so, you will leave my home with a greater treasure than you had initially sought when you entered it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Much humbled by Maalik&#8217;s manners and words, the thief said, &#8220;Yes, that is a generous offer indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After making ablution and performing two units of prayer, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, would you mind if I stayed for a while, for I want to stay to perform two more units of prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Stay for whatever amount of prayer Allah decrees for you to perform now.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thief ended up spending the entire night at Maalik&#8217;s house. He continued to pray until the morning. Then Maalik said, &#8220;Leave now and be good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But instead of leaving, the thief said, &#8220;Would you mind if I stayed here with you today, for I have made an intention to fast the day?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Stay as long as you wish,&#8221; said Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The burglar ended up staying for a number of days, praying during the late hours of each night and fasting throughout the duration of each day. When he finally decided to leave, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, I have made a firm resolve to repent for my sins and for my former way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Indeed, that is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man did mend his ways and began to lead a life of righteousness and obedience to Allah. Later on, He came across another burglar he knew. [His friend] said to him, &#8220;Have you found your treasure yet?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;My brother, what I found is Maalik bin Dinaar. I went to steal from him, but it was he who ended up stealing my heart. I have indeed repented to Allah, and I will remain at the door [of His Mercy and Forgiveness] until I achieve what his obedient, loving slaves have achieved.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Interesting Story !! Read on ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an interesting story related about Dinaar al-&#8216;Ayaar. Dinaar had a righteous mother who would constantly advise him to repent for his wayward, sinful existence, but as much as she tried, her words had no positive effect on him whatsoever. Then, one day, as he was walking by a graveyard, he stopped to pick up a bone. He was shocked to see how it crumbled and turned to dust in his hand. The sight of that bone had a profound effect on Dinaar. He began to think about his life and his past sins, and he then exclaimed, &#8220;Woe unto you, O Dinaar, you are going to end up like this crushed bone, and your body will turn into dust.&#8221; All of his past sins then flashed before his eyes, and he made a firm resolve to repent. Turning his gaze towards the sky, he said, &#8220;My Lord, I now turn to you in complete submission, so accept me and have Mercy on me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With a completely changed heart and state of mind, Dinaar went to his mother and said, &#8220;Mother, what does a master do when he captures his slave who had run away from him?&#8221; She said, &#8220;[To punish him] the master provides him with coarse clothing and low-quality food; and he ties his hands and feet so that he does not make another attempt to escape.&#8221; Dinaar said, &#8220;Then I want a garment made of coarse wool, low-quality barley, and two chains. Mother, do with me that which is done with a runaway slave. Perhaps my Lord will, upon seeing my humiliation and humility, have mercy on me.&#8221; Seeing that her son was adamant and resolute in his request, she complied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the beginning of every ensuing night, Dinaar would begin to cry and wail uncontrollably. And he would continue to repeat to himself the words, &#8220;Woe unto you, O Dinaar, do you have the power to withstand the Hell fire? How brazen you have been to have led a life that has made you deserving of the anger of the All-Mighty!&#8221; He would continue upon that state until the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Turning wan and pale, Dinaar&#8217;s body slowly wasted away. Not being able to bear seeing him in that pitiable state, his mother said, &#8220;My son, be easy on yourself.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;My mother, let me remain tied for a short while, so that perhaps I can achieve long-term comfort later on. For tomorrow, I will be waiting a long time before my Majestic Lord, and I do not know whether He will order me to go to places of beautiful shade or to places of unspeakable horror.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;My son, at least rest for a while.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is not present rest or comfort that I am seeking out. Mother, it is as if I see you and other people being led tomorrow towards Paradise, while I am being led towards the Hell-fire along with his inhabitants.&#8221; She left him then, and he returned to crying, worshipping, and reciting the Quran. One night, as he was reciting the Quran, he came across these verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْأَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِين عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ َ<br />
<strong>So, by your Lord [o Muhammad], We shall certainly call all of them to account, for all that they used to do.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[al-Hijr : 92-93]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As he contemplated the meanings and implications of these verses, he cried with such intensity that he fainted. His mother rushed to him and tried very hard to revive him, but he wouldn&#8217;t respond. She thought he had died. Looking into the face of her son, she said, &#8220;O my beloved one, O the joy of my heart, where shall we meet again?&#8221; In fact, Dinaar still had some life left in him, and hearing his mother&#8217;s words, he answered with a faint voice, &#8220;My mother, if you do not find me on the wide plains of the Day of Resurrection, then ask Maalik, the Custodian of Hell-fire about me.&#8221; He then made a croaking sound and died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After she finished washing his body, Dinaar&#8217;s mother prepared him for his funeral. She then went out and made the announcement, &#8220;O people, come to the funeral prayer of one who has been killed by [fear of] the Hell-fire.&#8221; People began to come from all directions. It is said that during that era, no greater gathering came together and no amount of tears were shed as much as on that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the same night that his funeral was held, one of Dinaar&#8217;s friends saw him in a dream, attired in a green robe. Dinaar was prancing around in Paradise, all the while reciting the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْأَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِين عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ َ<br />
<strong>So, by your Lord [o Muhammad], We shall certainly call all of them to account, for all that they used to do.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the dream, his friend heard him say, &#8220;By His Might and Majesty, He asked me [about my deeds]. Having mercy on me, He forgave me and pardoned me [my sins.] Lo! Convey news of this to my mother.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf bin Al-Husain is the narrator of this story:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Dhi-an-Nun on the edge of a stream, when we saw an extraordinarily large lizard crawling along the side of the stream. Something strange yet wonderful then happened. A frog surfaced from the stream, the lizard mounted its back, and the frog then swam to the other side of the stream, carrying its passenger on its back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhi-an-Nun said, &#8220;There is something interesting about that lizard let us go and follow it.&#8221; We crossed the stream (which wasn&#8217;t so wide in width), and on the other side, we saw a drunken man who had passed out. Suddenly, a snake appeared before the prone body of the drunkard. It slithered its way up to the man&#8217;s navel to his chest, making a direct course to one of his ears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lizard we saw earlier then sprang into action. It jumped onto the snake and struck it violently, splitting its body into two. Returning to the edge of the stream, the lizard then mounted the frog again, and the two crossed to the other side of the stream, though both were still visible to us. Dhi-an-Nun woke up the drunkard, who slowly opened his eyes and became conscious of what was happening around him. Dhi-an-Nun said, &#8220;O young man, look how Allah has saved you! When this snake came to kill you, that lizard came and killed it. He then explained the entire story to the young man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young man stood up and exclaimed: &#8220;O my lord, this is how you deal with one who disobeys you, then what will your mercy be like for the one who obeys you?&#8221; He then betook himself to the desert, vowing to dedicate his life to worship and to never return to the evils of the city.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THERE IS HOPE UNTIL THE VERY END</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, as Ali bin Abi Taalib and al-Hussain bin Ali were walking together, they heard a man supplicating to Allah. The man was begging Allah to forgive him for his evil crimes. His sincere tone and eloquent words aroused the interest of Ali, who turned to his son and said, &#8220;Do you not hear the man who is so very contrite because of his sins? Go catch up with him and call him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When al-Hussain caught up with the man, he saw that he was clean-looking, clean-smelling, with nice clothes and altogether handsome- except that he seemed to be paralyzed on the right side of his body. Al-Hussain said, &#8220;Answer the summons of the Leader of the believers, Ali bin Abu Taalib.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dragging his right side, the man followed al-Hussain back to where Ali was waiting for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Who are you and what is your story,&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My story is that of a man who did not fulfill the rights of others and is now being punished for that,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And what is your name?&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Munaazil bin Laahiq,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And what is your story?&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was famous among the Arabs for my frivolous and sinful exploits. Merciful and kind, my father would constantly admonish me and advise me to mend my ways. He would remind me of Allah&#8217;s punishment, saying, &#8216;My son, do not go against He who punishes with the Hell-fire!&#8217; When he would persist in advising me, I felt his voice grating on my nerves. I would get so frustrated that I would beat him with harsh blows. In response to my blows, he one day said, &#8216;By Allah, I will fast without breaking my fast and I will pray without stopping to sleep.&#8217; He fasted for an entire week, but seeing no change in my behavior, he climbed a camel and set off to perform Hajj. His parting words were, &#8216;I am going to the House of Allah, and there I will seek help from Allah against you.&#8217; When he reached Makkah, he embraced the curtain of the Kaa&#8217;ba and supplicated against me, asking Allah to make me paralyzed on one side of my body. By the One Who raised the sky and sends down the rain, no sooner did my father finish his supplication than I became paralyzed on my right side, which became like a piece of wood. Anyone that would then pass by me would point to me and say, &#8216;Allah answered his father&#8217;s supplication against him.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What did your father do then?&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Leader of the Believers, after he became pleased with me, I asked him to go back and invoke Allah on my behalf. He agreed to do so. I walked alongside him as he rode on his camel, until we reached a place called the Valley of Arak. When we reached there, a group of birds flew away from a tree, their sudden movement frightened the camel. As the camel raced off in a state of fright, my father fell off it and died.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was certainly late for the man, but not too late, and so Ali advised him to continue to supplicate and to repent for his past misdeeds. Ali then parted from the man, but before leaving him, he taught him the supplication that a person in distress should say. [The narration does not specifically mention which supplication it was that Ali taught the man.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE EVER-LIVING NEVER SLEEPS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both of them lived in a small town that was populated by only tens or hundreds of people. He was in love with her, and so when he saw her walking alone one night, he followed her until he had her cornered. When he came near to her, he said, &#8220;Woman, I crave for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;First go and see if all the people are asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Very pleased at her response, he walked around the town and returned. &#8220;Everyone is asleep,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What about Allah Azza wa Jal?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Is He sleeping at this hour?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Woman, what are you saying?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Indeed, Allah does not sleep: neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The One Who hasn&#8217;t slept and doesn&#8217;t sleep sees us, even if people don&#8217;t see us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you not fear He Who neither sleeps nor is heedless of anything that happens?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man left her alone with tears flowing from his eyes, having nothing in mind except the desire to repent to the One Who neither sleeps nor is heedless of anything that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (rahimahullah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sin may be more beneficial for a person, <strong>if</strong> it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.&#8217;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;How is that?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation.<br />
And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sin may be the factor that leads him to do acts of worship and good deeds and to change his attitude so that he fears Allah and feels shy before Him and feels humiliated before Him, hanging his head in shame and weeping with regret, seeking he forgiveness of his Lord. Each of these effects is better for a person than an act of worship that makes him feel proud and show off and look down on people. Undoubtedly this sin is better before Allah and is more likely to bring salvation than one who admires himself and looks down on others, and who thinks that he is doing Allah a favour. Even if he says words that indicate something other than that, Allah is the Witness over what is in his heart. Such a person may feel hatred towards people if they do not hold him in high esteem and humiliate themselves before him. If he were to examine himself honestly, he would see that clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>-Madarij as-Salikeen, 1/299</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Saheeh al Bukhaaree</strong> : Volume 5, Book 59, Number 702</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah ibn Kab bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the <strong>story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk</strong> in which he failed to take part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah had excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept silent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal for carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favour, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When fourty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said, &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah described (in the Qur&#8217;an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.<br />
The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse: &#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).&#8221; (9.117-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to the three (He did forgive also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.</p>
