<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#999999;">Smoking: Is It <em>Haraam</em> (Unlawful)?</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Author: Sheikh (Dr) Muhamad Bin Ahmad Bin Ismaa’eel</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Translated by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Muslims regard smoking as disliked by <em>Sharee’ah</em> but not forbidden. When an advice is given about smoking and its ruling you often hear a defensive response. People know the killing effects of smoking, but Satan wants them to keep on spending and burning their chests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, cigarettes were not present in the lifetime of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). However, what was present and will continue to be present is the Revelation in its forms, the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. The Qur’aan formulated the prohibition of everything that is evil:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>He allows them all that is good and lawful, and prohibits them as unlawful all that is evil</strong>.” (Qur’aan 7: 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Evil manifests itself in things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, drinks, etc. Let us see whether smoking is evil or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1-Smoking is a killer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It causes lung cancer, tuberculosis, and heart diseases, to mention a few. We know that Allaah forbids us from killing ourselves. He says:</p>
<h3>وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا</h3>
<h3>وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ عُدْوَانًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا ۚ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not kill yourselves</strong> (nor kill one another)<strong>. Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah.”</strong> (Qur’aan 4: 29-30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not throw yourselves into destruction”</strong> (Qur’aan 2: 195)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above ‘<em>Ayaat</em> are sufficient to prove the <em>Tahreem</em> of smoking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2-Smoking burns wealth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3> وَلَا تُبَذِّرْ تَبْذِيرًا</h3>
<h3>إِنَّ الْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;But spend not wastefully </strong>(your wealth)<strong> in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the devils.”</strong> (Qur’aan 17: 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see some Muslim smokers, may Allaah guide them to the truth, reserving their cash to buy a pack or a twelve-pack carton of cigarettes, or for the “pipe stuff”, etc. wasting their money and their chests: waste on top of waste.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3-Smoking inflicts harm on non-smokers: </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There should be neither harming, nor reciprocating harm”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[An authentic hadeeth reported in Saheeh Al-Jaam’, # 7517.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a-Smoking harms the body.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b-It is harmful to others.</strong> Many people encounter breathing problems when they smell a pipe or a cigarette, especially people suffering from bronchial asthma.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c-It is the cause of many devastating fires, etc.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4-Smokers cause the spread of evil:</span></strong> They smoke openly and thus encourage others to smoke.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5-Smoking effects worship:</strong></span> Many smokers dislike fasting and praying because they become impatient. They want to go for the next “round”. The smoker becomes like an addict.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6-Smoking makes people smell bad:</strong></span> His car, clothes, home, etc. Carry the bad smell too! He hurts others with his smell while in prayer. In fact the angels also get affected by the smell, because the Prophet ρ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever has eaten from such greens: garlic, onions, or leek should keep away from our mosque. Truly, the angels are harmed by that which harms the offspring of Adam.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Al-Bukaree, Muslim, At-Tirmithee, and An-Nassaa’ee from the hadeeth of Jaabir. See Saheeh AlJaami’ # 6089.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above points are clear evidences that smoking is evil, and thus it is <em>Haraam</em> (unlawful). If the Muslim is under any kind of stress, then he must turn to Allaah for help. The Book of Allaah, the Qur’aan is a healing. When the urge for smoking arise, resort to the Qur’aan and strive to comply with Allaah’s commands:</p>
<h3>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمَعَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who strive hard in Us </strong>(Our Cause)<strong>, We will surely guide them to Our Paths.&#8221;</strong> (Qur’aan 29: 69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>You may want to take by some of the following means while depending upon Allaah, seeking His help and guidance:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Try to minimize drinking the drinks that became “mentally related” to smoking:coffee, tea, etc.<br />
2-Whenever there is an urge for smoking, try to make yourself busy with something else.<br />
3-Minimize contact with smokers.<br />
4-Try not to accept a cigerette from anyone.<br />
5-Try not to finish smoking the whole cigarette. Go to two thirds, then half, etc.<br />
6-Try not to deeply inhale the smoke.<br />
7-Try to drink a lot of water one you quit smoking.<br />
8-Try to remember that you want to gain the pleasure of Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 14777</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a married woman with children and I am a practicing Muslim &#8211; all praise be to Allah &#8211; but my husband smokes<strong> Shisha (hookah, water pipe)</strong>. I have advised him, in vain, to give it up. In fact, he has sworn by Allah that he will stop smoking it, but he has not done so. After this, I took an oath by Allah that, if he did not stop smoking, I would go to my parents, but he has not stopped and I have not gone to my parents. What should I do with my husband? What is the ruling on the oath that I took? What is the ruling on smoking Shisha? I hope that you will answer my letter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>: smoking shisha is Haram (prohibited) because it is an obnoxious habit and includes many harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: It is Wajib (obligatory) on your husband to fulfill his oath and stop smoking Shisha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You have done well to advise your husband to stop smoking Shisha. You should continue doing so and make Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah for Him to guide your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the oath that you broke, you have to make Kaffarah (expiation) for it and you should not go to stay with your parents.The Kaffarah is to feed ten Miskin (needy people), to clothe them, or to free a believing slave. If you are unable to do any of these things, you should observe Sawm (Fasting) for three days.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Ruling on smoking and using hookah &#8211; Shaykh Ibn Baaz</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on smoking and using hookah? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Smoking and using hookah are prohibited, because they contain evil and much harm. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made lawful for His servants all kinds of lawful and good things and made unlawful to them all kinds of evil things, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says to His Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: &#8220;Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful-good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]</span>. Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says with regard to the description of His Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&#8221;  </span>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 157</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No type of smoking is from the lawful good things, but they are from the evil things due to their much harm. They are not from the lawful-good things which Allah (Exalted be He) permitted; therefore, they should be abandoned and o<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ne should beware of approaching them and should strive against his evil soul to avoid these evil things, because the soul persists in evil, except those relieved by Allah&#8217;s Mercy.</strong></span> It is the duty of the believer to strive against his soul to set aside whatever harms him from these and other evil things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. <strong>In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette</strong>. The chemical compositions of cigarette smoke and hookah smoke are different, however, as the workings of the charcoal in the modern hookah causes the tobacco mixture to be heated to a lower temperature, as opposed to the higher temperature in a cigarette where the tobacco is directly burnt. Consequently, the potential health effects of hookah smoke are expected to be very different.<sup id="cite_ref-Saad_58-0" class="reference"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And from the forbidden types of business is: Selling a forbidden commodity. This is because when Allaah makes something forbidden, He also makes taking money for it forbidden, such as when someone sells something that is forbidden to be sold. Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade that dead animals, khamr (i.e. wine), swine and statues be sold So whoever sells dead animals, i.e. meat for which no prescribed Zakaat was given, then he has sold a dead animal and earned unlawful money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes the same for selling khamr. What is meant by the word khamr is everything that intoxicates, based on the Prophet’s saying: <b>“Every intoxicant is khamr and every kind of khamr is Haraam (unlawful).”</b> And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) cursed ten people with regard to khamr, as is recorded in the authentic hadeeth: <b>“Verily Allaah cursed khamr – the one who produces it and the one for whom it is produced, the one who sells it and the one who buys it, the one who drinks it and the one who earns from the sale of it, the one who carries it and the one who it is carried to, and the one who serves it.”</b> Reported by At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khamr is every type of intoxicant regardless of whether it is called khamr or alcoholic beverages or liquor or wine or whiskey. It doesn’t matter if it is called by any of these or other names – changing the name does not change the fact that it is khamr. It has been reported in a hadeeth that <b>”There will come a people during the Last Days that will call khamr by another name and drink it.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, what is worse than this is selling narcotics, such as <b>hasheesh and opium</b>, as well as other types of drugs, which are being dealt out to the people in these days. So the one who sells it and deals it is a criminal in the eyes of the Muslims and in the eyes of the whole world. This is because drugs kill people, so it is like a destructive weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who sells drugs or distributes it or assists in its distribution – all of them fall under the curse of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And taking money from it is from the wickedest of acts and the most detestable of gains. Furthermore, the one who deals drugs deserves to be executed because he is one of those who cause mischief in the land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for selling <b>cigarettes and qaat</b> (leaves that are chewed in Arabian lands). Cigarettes are harmful and they cause diseases to occur. In fact, all of the characteristics of <i>khubth</i>(wickedness) are gathered together in cigarettes. There is no benefit in smoking in any way whatsoever. Its harms are many. The one with the worst kind of breath, the most despicable appearance and the most burdensome to accompany out of all people is the one who smokes cigarettes. If he sits next to you or he rides next to you in a car or on a plane, you feel constricted by the smoke he makes and its foul stench. The odor coming from his mouth is bad enough when he breathes in your face, so how much more so if he were to smoke in your presence and the cigarette smoke were to float in your face! The matter would be worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So smoking is wicked from all perspectives and there isn’t any benefit found in it. Therefore, it is forbidden without any hesitation or doubt. It is unlawful to smoke based on several perspectives, not just one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one smokes, he throws money away and he wastes time. Cigarettes disfigure the face, blacken the lips and stain the teeth. As for the diseases that are caused by it, then they are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people have been afflicted by it and yet they take it lightly and as something trivial. This is even to the point that some are suffering from its effects even though they never smoked and they hate smoking. However, they sold it to people because they loved to make money any way they could. But these people don’t know that this type of business spoils all of their earnings, because some of them mix the money they make from it with their business and so they spoil it, since (doing this) is forbidden and disobedience (to Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sustenance is not to be sought from Allaah through disobeying Him. Rather, sustenance and provision are to be sought from Allaah by way of obeying Him. Whatever Allaah has ordained for you from <i>rizq</i> (sustenance) will surely come to you. If you seek after it while being obedient to Allaah (in all that He commands and prohibits), He will facilitate it for you and bless your wealth.</p>
