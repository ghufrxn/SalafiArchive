										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 06 : Point 04A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[ <strong>Note</strong>: In this audio, explanation of the only first paragraph from the above is covered]</em></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-religion-is-only-what-came-from-allaah-it-was-not-left-to-the-intellectsopinions-of-men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion came only from Allaah, so He is the One who legislated the Religion, He the Perfect. It is not for anyone to legislate religion, which Allaah has not permitted. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they have partners who legislate for them religion, not ordained by Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a rebuke and a warning. So the Religion is that which Allaah has legislated, and which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam conveyed. This is the Religion about which Allaah the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) legislated for you the Religion with which He enjoined Nooh, and which He revealed to you, and which He enjoined upon Ibraaheem, and Moosaa and `Eesaa; that you should establish the Religion, and not separate within it.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the revealed way of the Prophets, specifically those five Prophets, who are those firmest in resolve. This is their Religion. So whoever deviates away from it or differs with it, then he is destroyed and he is astray. And it is built upon the tawheed of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic (singling out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with all worship) and abandonment of the worship of everything besides Him, and restricting oneself to that which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic legislated, and keeping away from whatever Allaah has forbidden &#8211; this is the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It was not left up to the intellects of men and their opinions.”</strong> &#8211; the Religion is not what men deem to be good or what they hold as their opinion, because this is not the Religion of Allaah. This is the Religion of the people, which they have newly invented. As for the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then it is what He legislated. As for that which the men hold as their opinion, based upon their own opinions, this is not the Religion of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Rather it is just a religion of whoever holds that opinion. So nothing can be ascribed to Allaah from the Religion except that which He legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And as for what others besides Him legislated, then it cannot be ascribed to Allaah, rather it can only be ascribed to whoever legislated it, and Allaah is free of it. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they have partners who legislate for them religion which Allaah has not permitted</strong></span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And its knowledge is with Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</strong> &#8211; the affairs of the Religion are <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>towqeefiyyah</em> </span>(depend upon text); there must be proofs from Allaah and His Messenger with regard to the affairs of the Religion. The matter is restricted to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from the affairs of the Religion. And newly introduced matters and innovations are abandoned, that which Allaah has not sent down any proof for &#8211; even if their people hold them to be religion, and they draw closer to Allaah through them, then we turn no attention to these things and we do not believe in them, because the Religion of Allaah is what He legislated and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Religion is based upon knowledge which came from Allaah and His Messenger. And do not follow the desires of the people and the opinions of the people and what they declare to be good and what they follow each other upon, and it has no basis in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected”</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who wishes that his action be righteous and be beneficial, then he should adhere to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first matter:</strong> is that he makes his Religion pure for Allaah and free from shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second matter:</strong> ittibaa`, following the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, free of innovations and newly introduced affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person will indeed find many things which contradict what is correct in the `aqeedah, matters which contradict what is correct in matters of worship, many of them; (because) the people have desires, and have their own aspirations, and they have their own opinions and they have their own ways (which they follow). So we do not follow the people, rather we present whatever the people are upon to the Book and the Sunnah. So whatever conforms with the Book and the Sunnah then it is the Truth, and whatever contradicts these two then it is false and futile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this lecture is, “al-Bay’aa wa Hizbiyyah” (Allegiance and Partisanship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Bay’aa (Allegiance):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam brought forth the obligation to give bay’aa (allegiance), and the Prophet (: sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded it. The allegiance was originally given to him, then the leaders after him and then the khulafah (caliphs) afterwards. In our time, many deviated; making bay’aa to anyone they chose from those who set themselves up as leaders of Muslim groups. Due to the large number of groups, al-bay’aa has multiplied and varied, becoming even numerous. This has led to disputes, with each group claiming to be on the truth and that their leader deserves the legal bay’aa (allegiance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Definition of al-Bay’aa:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Linguistically, al-bay’aa means to reach an agreement with respect to matters of trade or on obedience and following (i.e., a covenant).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islamic meaning (al-istilah), albay’aa means the covenant on obedience. It is as if the one who pledges allegiance gives the covenant to his ameer (leader), assigning him the ability to conclude matters concerning himself and the Muslims at large; this ameer can not be disputed with in any way. Similarly, the Muslim agrees to obey the ameer in what he assigns from certain tasks, whether it is in times of ease or difficulty, in that which he likes, and that which he dislikes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of the past used to give albay’aa to the leaders and give him the covenant, they would put their hands in his hand affirming the &#8216;ahd, confirming the promise of allegiance in a manner similar to the way people shake hands after reaching an agreement while selling and buying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Definition of Hizbiyyah (Partisanship):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the linguistic aspect, al-hizb means a group of people; the plural of hizb is ahzab (parties). The hizb of a man are his followers and his soldiers, who are holding to the same view as him. If a group of people’s hearts and deeds are in agreement, then they constitute a hizb, even though they may not physically meet. In addition, a hizb, linguistically, is a kind of people whose desires are the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic or legal meaning (i.e., in Islamic terminology) of hizb is not totally blameworthy nor is it entirely praiseworthy. It is blamed or praised in accordance with its intended use. For instance, Allah says in the Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;">Shaytan has overtaken them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Shaytan. Verily, it is the party of Shaytan (hizbushaytan) that will be the losers!</span> » [Surah al-Mujadilah (58:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Clearly, this is an example that is blameworthy. Similarly, in the same surah (chapter) of the Qur’an, Allah says (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">They are the Party of Allah (hizbaAllahi). Verily, it is the Party of Allah that will be the successful</span>. » [Surah al-Mujadilah (58:22)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in one context, it was blameworthy when the hizb was associated with Shaytan, and in another instance, it was praiseworthy when it was the party of Allah, concerning the believers.1 Certainly, if the hizb comprises the people of wickedness, desires, misguidance and disbelief, then all of that is blameworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dangers of Hizbiyyah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who examines the Islamic history finds that tahazub (bigotry) to opinions, madhahib (schools of thought), and innovations splits the Muslim ummah and takes away from its unity. That is why the textual proofs are replete with calls for unity and keeping from all means that leads to splitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling concerning al-Bay’aa</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many textual proofs came to confirm the command of pledging allegiance and to warn against abandoning it and the consequences of that. Allah says (in the translation of the meanings):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If any group would carry such a name, then it must not have convictions and practices that oppose Tawheed, like invoking other than Allah, and worshipping graves etc. This is shirk. So Muslims should not be deceived by emotional and (or) politically misleading practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave their Bay’aa (pledge) to you (O Muhammad ) under the tree, He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakinah (calmness and tranquility) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory.</span> » [Surah al-Fath (48:18)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah says in the same surah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, those who give Bay’aa (pledge) to you (O Muhammad ) they are giving Bay’aa (pledge) to Allah. The Hand of Allah is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge breaks only to his own harm, and whosoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward</span>. » [Surah al-Fath (48:10)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also emphasized al-bay’aa, calling for the believer to give allegiance and stating that whoever dies without having pledged allegiance to the Muslim ruler dies in the state of the pre-Islamic era. This refers to giving the pledge to the general Muslim imam who most people give the pledge to in his time or in his country, in the absence of the general Muslim khilaafah. This is the obligated pledge incumbent on every Muslim, and it is forbidden to abandon or dissent in terms of obedience on this pledge, whether in times of ease or difficulty, in that which he likes and that which he dislikes. This applies as long as the leader does not command sins, in which case, he can not be obeyed but rather is to be obeyed in other issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not obeying the ruler on sins which he may command, does not necessitate rebellion against him, as many of the youth understand. When we talk about this imam, whether he was set up by influential people in the country or assigned by his predecessor or even to the degree that he took leadership by force, it is forbidden to rebel against him as long as he does not commit clear, plain kufr and until the conditions of rebellion to remove him are fulfilled. First, his kufr must be clear and can not tolerate any misinterpretation, requiring an unambiguous proof from Allah and (or) the Messenger () that his case (saying and/or action) is truly kufr. Moreover, there must be the ability to change him and that this change will not lead to a greater evil. When all these conditions are met, and it is obvious how difficult this is, only then can he may be removed; otherwise the Muslims are told to be patiently persevering until these conditions are fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Illegal Bay’aa:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In our time, numerous deviations have occurred with respect to illegal pledges, not condoned by shariah. This has had a negative impact on Muslim society at large. The following are some instances of deviant pledges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first example is that of the <strong>Sufis to their elders or their shaykhs</strong>. You find the Sufi mystic making an &#8220;eternal&#8221; pledge to his shaykh, such that he can never leave that shaykh’s way. Such a pledge has no basis in shariah; rather, it is without a doubt futile. Some mystic Sufis give the pledge by shaking hands between men and women. They say they will continue to be that shaykh’s students and adepts, no matter what that shaykh says. To that end, they even take the pledge to share their wealth and money with him. In fact, the shaykh can take a tax levee from them. These are criminal acts and mischief that have no basis in shariah and Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the second type of <strong>deviant pledges is that of group members to their group leaders</strong>; this is becoming widespread in many countries. Everyday you find these groups splitting, forming subgroups and sub leaders. In these groups, the leaders request from the members to make a full pledge, as if it were the legal pledge to the Muslim general leader or imam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These groups vary with respect to the covenants they take. Some say that anyone who abandons giving the pledge of allegiance to the leader of their group is a kaafir (disbeliever). Others maintain that giving the pledge is fardh (obligatory) and that anyone who does not give it is sinful. As such, they assign an ameer for their group as a means to lift the sin from them. This kind of pledge is futile, baseless, and not found in shariah. Anyone who claims it is obligatory to give a pledge of allegiance to a leader of a group is certainly in error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> Consequences of the Illegal Bay’aa:</strong> </span>The consequences of the illegal bay’aa are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, we now have more than one pledge at the same time and in the same country because each group thinks that the correct bay’aa is for their ameer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, these bay’aa lead to enmity, conflict, and hatred between these groups. In turn, they compete with each other to acquire larger and larger numbers for their groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, it has spread misconceptions regarding takfeer because some of these groups believe that the one who does not give the pledge is a kaafir and feels that their ameer is the only ameer. Therefore, they make takfeer on anyone who does not give the pledge to that ameer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>, it has led to the spilling of the inviolable blood. In some Muslim countries, a member of a particular group may be killed if he decides to leave that group. Likewise, a leader of a group may kill a competitor or those who oppose his leadership. This is real, and not fictional, occurring in many places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>, this has led and still leads to confrontations between these groups and the government. The consequences of that are terrible, including rebellion, bloodshed, harshness, takfeer, and evil on top of evil. It has reached the degree that some of these groups have adopted what they call “revolutionary concepts,” when even the term “revolution” has nothing to do with Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The consequences of these illegal ahzab (parties) who demand bay’aa are great. They have corrupted the souls and thoughts of many Muslim youths around the world. We refer the matter to Allah, the Most High. We ask Him to save us from falling into this mischief and to protect the ummah (Islamic nation) from such disputes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source:Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb &#8216;alaa As&#8217;ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 141-143) [1]<br />
Taken from al-ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> There is a group amongst us (here in the UK) called Hizb-ut-Tahreer. They call for the Islamic Khilaafah and they speak against the scholars. How can they be refuted and what is the way towards achieving the proper Islamic Khilaafah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings be on our prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I testufy that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the issue of partisanship, people are divided into two parties: The party of Ar-Rahmaan (Allaah) and the party of ash-Shaytaan (the Devil). So the party of ar-Rahmaan &#8211; it is not permissible for them to be divided amongst themselves. Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>&#8220;Verily those who divide their Religion and break up into sects, you have no concern with them in the least.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Jews split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects. And the Christians split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects. And my ummah will split up into seventy-three sects.&#8221;</b> This hadeeth was reported by Abu Dawood from the narration of Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). Abu Dawood reported a similar hadeeth from Mu&#8217;awiyah but in it there occurs: <b>&#8220;All of them (these sects) will be in the Hellfire, except one sect.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;Who is it O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221;</b> He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> Then he said: <b>&#8220;And there will indeed come a people of whom vain desires will move them just as rabies moves around the one it affects.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) warned us of has already come to pass, for the desires have become many and the parties and groups have multiplied. And Allaah, the Lord of Glory, says in His Noble Book: <b>&#8220;And hold on tightly to the Rope of Allaah, all of you, and be not divided.&#8221;</b> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you, step by step, even if they were to enter the hole of a lizard you would enter into it (after them).&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and the Christians?&#8221;</b> He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: &#8220;Who else?&#8221; And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The beleiver with respect to another beleiver is like a building, each part supports the other.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for these parties, then they chase each other away and they attack one another. In fact, if one were to say: &#8220;These splitting into parties has actualized what the enemies of Islaam have desired from splitting up the ummah, dividing its ranks and weaking its strength&#8221; he would be speaking truthfully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, (I say that) Hizb-ut-Tahreer is a hizb (party) that is wicked. Perhaps you think this is a grave statement since I am the first one to say such a thing, but it is proper that I introduce such a statement. So I say again, it is indeed a wicked party, which began in Jordan. They split away from the Ikhwaan al-Muslimoon, who wrote to them requesting them to return but they refused to go back to them. Their leader was Taqee-ud-Deen an-Nubhaanee. Concerning the matters related to Creed, they say: <b>&#8220;Nothing should be accepted except for that which conforms to the intellect.&#8221;</b> So if there is found some hearing (of a report), then this hearing must be eliminated. That is why they reject the Punishment in the Grave and they reject that the Dajjaal will be brought forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they have no concern for teaching good etiquettes nor with spreading knowledge. So it is a party that cultivates its followers upon seekiing after and studying politics, which opposes the Religion. And it was once said to the leader of this group: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we see any schools for the memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan in your party?&#8221; So he responded: &#8220;I do not want to produce dervishes!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rely on politics only, and they do not rely on knowledge and etiquettes, nor on the heart-softening narrations. And with regard to issues of Fiqh, they make it permissible for a man to shake hands with a woman that is not related to him. And they say that it is permissible for a woman to be a leader and that she can sit in a governing council (majlis ash-shuraa). In fact they even allow a disbeliever to be in the governing council and that he can be given general leadership positions! So it is a deviant group that has surpassed the extent of deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I am surprised at those who join and adhere to this party. So I advise every brother to stay far away from this group and to warn against it. And if it were not that we make excuses for them, that they misinterpret the texts, we would have said that they were disbelievers because they reject the Punishment in the Grave and they reject the coming of the Maseeh ad-Dajjaal. And their leader says that he does not like to teach his students the Qur&#8217;aan so that they will not come out as dervishes.<br />

The Shaykh explains many sects/groups claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, however the only sect i.e. the saved sect are the ones who follow the salaf us-saalih in their understanding of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الشيخ محمد بن صالح العثيمين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhmmad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen affirms that the Salafis are following the Hizb of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh explains that the Salafis who follow the truth, the way of the Salaf, without tahazzub (partisanship), are the party of Allaah in truth, and that it is obligatory for everyone to associate himself with it. The Shaykh also explains that none can be from this party of Allaah (of Salafiyyah) unless they actually follow the way of the Salaf in reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: The Shaykh praised the refutations of Shaykh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee and his defending the manhaj of calling to Allaah. These matters are well-recorded and known. Thus, when the Shaykh is warning from tahazzub as occurs in other statements of his, even if it be in the name of &#8220;Salafiyyah&#8221;, then that applies to those deviants who followed other methodologies (like those of the Ikhwanis) whilst claiming to be &#8220;Salafis&#8221; and declaring others to be astray unless they join their group. This behaviour was manifest in the way of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq and his so-called &#8220;Scientific Salafiyyah&#8221; movement, he reviled some of the major Scholars, and brought destructive false principles under the banner of Salafiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No matter how hard people have tried to malign the Salafis who follow the way of the Salaf in aqidah and manhaj, following the scholars in that, all their attempts to use the various statements of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin in which he warns, correctly, from falling into tahazzub in the name of Salafiyyah, have failed. This is because the very issues around which the Salafis based their criticism and warning against the opposers, were similarly spoken of and outlined by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin by the time he passed away (rahimahullaah) and they include matters pertaining to Sayyid Qutb, Takfir of the rulers, rebellion, multiplicity of groups (jamaa&#8217;aat), false methodologies in calling to Allaah, and calling to Tawhid, demonstrations and so on. Further, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin praised Shaykh Rabee on many occasions and explained that the only reason the opposers attack him because he spoke of some of their figureheads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the truth is clear and only those are blind who choose to be blind, despite the matters being as clear as daylight.</p>
