<p><strong>Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَاتَّخِذُوا مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ۖ وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And (remember) when We made the House </strong>(the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong> a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam </strong>(place)<strong> of Ibrahim </strong>(Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrahim (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah]<strong> as a place of prayer</strong> (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak&#8217;at after the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong>, and We commanded Ibrahim </strong>(Abraham)<strong> and Isma&#8217;il </strong>(Ishmael)<strong> that they should purify My House </strong>(the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong> for those who are circumambulating it, or staying </strong>(I&#8217;tikaf)<strong>, or bowing or prostrating themselves </strong>(there, in prayer)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">[Qur’aan – Surah al-Baqarah 2:125]</p>
<p><strong>Posted from</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/17/tafseer-explanation-surah-al-baqarah-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah Al-Baqarah</strong></a> – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En]. Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen’s Tafseer</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Virtue of Allah&#8217;s House</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">125. And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (or the stone on which Ibrahim as a place)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They do not remain in the House, they only visit it and return to their homes, and then visit it again.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Abu Jafar Ar-Razi narrated from Ar-Rabi bin Anas from Abu Al-Aliyah who said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Safe from enemies and armed conflict. During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people were often victims of raids and kidnapping, while the people in the area surrounding it (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) were safe and not subject to kidnapping.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Mujahid, Ata&#8217;, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas were reported to have said that the Ayah (2:125) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever enters it shall be safe.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that Allah honored the Sacred House, which Allah made as a safe refuge and safe haven. Therefore, the souls are eager, but never bored, to conduct short visits to the House, even every year. This is because Allah accepted the supplication of His Khalil, Ibrahim, when he asked Allah to make the hearts of people eager to visit the House. Ibrahim said (14:40),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ</strong><br />
(Our Lord! And accept my invocation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah described the House as a safe resort and refuge, for those who visit it are safe, even if they had committed acts of evil. This honor comes from the honor of the person who built it first, Khalil Ar-Rahman, just as Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لإِبْرَهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْئاً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim the site of the (Sacred) House (the Kabah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me&#8230;&#8221;) (22:26) and,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-Alamin (mankind and Jinn). In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:96-97).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last honorable Ayah emphasized the honor of Ibrahim&#8217;s Maqam, and the instruction to pray next to it,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer). The Maqam of Ibrahim Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Said bin Jubayr commented on the Ayah,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer) &#8220;The stone (Maqam) is the standing place of Ibrahim, Allah&#8217;s Prophet, and a mercy from Allah. Ibrahim stood on the stone, while Ismail was handing him the stones (constructing the Kabah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Maqam of Ibrahim is a stone which Ismail&#8217;s wife put under Ibrahim&#8217;s feet when washing his head.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi mentioned this, but he considered it unauthentic, although others gave it prefrence, Ar-Razi reported it in his Tafsir from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi bin Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Jabir, describing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet said, &#8220;When the Prophet performed Tawaf, Umar asked him, Is this the Maqam of our father&#8217; He said, Yes.&#8217; Umar said, Should we take it a place of prayer&#8217; So Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Chapter: Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer) meaning, they return to it repeatedly.&#8221; He then narrated that Anas bin Malik said that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;I agreed with my Lord, or my Lord agreed with me, regarding three matters. I said, O Messenger of Allah! I wish you take the Maqam of Ibrahim a place for prayer.&#8217; The Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham)) was revealed. I also said, O Messenger of Allah! The righteous and the wicked enter your house. I wish you would command the Mothers of the believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) to wear Hijab. Allah sent down the Ayah that required the Hijab. And when I knew that the Prophet was angry with some of his wives, I came to them and said, Either you stop what you are doing, or Allah will endow His Messenger with better women than you are.&#8217; I advised one of his wives and she said to me, O Umar! Does the Messenger of Allah not know how to advise his wives, so that you have to do the job instead of him&#8217; Allah then revealed,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَـتٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;">It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you, ـ Muslims (who submit to Allah)</span>).&#8221; (66:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Jabir said, &#8220;After the Messenger of Allah kissed the Black Stone, he went around the house three times in a fast pace and four times in a slow pace. He then went to Maqam of Ibrahim, with it between him and the House, and prayed two Rakahs.&#8221; This is part of the long Hadith that Muslim recorded in Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that Amr bin Dinar said that he heard Ibn Umar say, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf around the House seven times and then prayed two Rakahs behind the Maqam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these texts indicate that the Maqam is the stone that Ibrahim was standing on while building the House. As the House&#8217;s walls became higher, Ismail brought his father a stone, so that he could stand on it, while Ismail handed him the stones. Ibrahim would place the stones on the wall, and whenever he finished one side, he would move to the next side, to complete the building all around. Ibrahim kept repeating this until he finished building the House, as we will describe when we explain the story of Ibrahim and Ismail and how they built the House, as narrated from Ibn Abbas and collected by Al-Bukhari. Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints were still visible in the stone, and the Arabs knew this fact during the time of Jahiliyyah. This is why Abu Talib said in his poem known as Al-Lamiyyah&#8217;, &#8220;And Ibrahim&#8217;s footprint with his bare feet on the stone is still visible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims also saw Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints on the stone, as Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;I saw the Maqam with the print of Ibrahim&#8217;s toes and feet still visible in it, but the footprints dissipated because of the people rubbing the stone with their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier, the Maqam was placed close to the Kabah&#8217;s wall. In the present time, the Maqam is placed next to Al-Hijr on the right side of those entering through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibrahim finished building the House, he placed the stone next to the wall of Al-Kabah. Or, when the House was finished being built, Ibrahim just left the stone where it was last standing, and he was commanded to pray next to the stone when he finished the Tawaf (circumambulating). It is understandable that the Maqam of Ibrahim would stand where the building of the House ended. The Leader of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab, one of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs whom we were commanded to emulate, moved the stone away from the Kabah&#8217;s wall during his reign. Umar is one of the two men, whom the Messenger of Allah described when he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَبِي بَكْرٍ وَعُمَر»</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imitate the two men who will come after me: Abu Bakr and Umar.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar was also the person whom the Qur&#8217;an agreed with regarding praying next to Maqam of Ibrahim. This is why none among the Companions rejected it when he moved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ibn Jurayj from Ata&#8217;, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab moved the Maqam back.&#8221; Also, Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Mujahid said that Umar was the first person who moved the Maqam back to where it is now standing.&#8221; Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr, Ahmad bin Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Bayhaqi recorded A&#8217;ishah saying, &#8220;<strong>During the time of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr, the Maqam was right next to the House. Umar moved the Maqam during his reign</strong>.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration.</p>

<p>Source: <a title="FAQ – Clarifications on Important Matters – Dr. Saleh as Saleh [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/11/15/faq-clarifications-on-important-matters-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Important Matters Requiring Clarification</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen wa sallalaahu ala nabeeyena Muhammad wa alaa alihi wa sahbhi wa sallama tasleeman kaseera</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Question is why was the Ka&#8217;abah called Baytullah Al Haraam, The inviolable house of Allah ?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ka&#8217;bah was called Baytullah i.e The House of Allah. That is because it is the place of magnification of Allah(عز و جل) Most Mighty and Most Majestic.People come to it from all places in order to offer an obligation which Allah had ordained upon them and also because people direct themselves in its direction while in their prayers, wherever they may be fulfilling one of the conditions of the Salah i.e. directing one self towards the Qibla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) stated in Surah Al- Baqarah (2:144) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ‌ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةً۬ تَرۡضَٮٰهَا‌ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ‌ۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُ ۥ‌ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبَ لَيَعۡلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلۡحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمۡ‌ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعۡمَلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Harâm (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what they do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) narrated it to Himself added it when he mentioned the Ka&#8217;abah as an honour and magnification of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because that which is related to Allah in the construct of the statements by Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The Attribute of Himself (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)<br />
2) The creature of  his creation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is an attribute, then it is related because it is established with Him and Allah(عز و جل) is qualified by it, it is His attribute like Allah&#8217;s hearing, Allah&#8217;s sight, Allah&#8217;s knowledge, Allah&#8217;s ability, Allah&#8217;s speech and other than that from His most mighty and magnificent attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it s a creature from his creation, then it is added to Allah (عز و جل) in the construct as away of honouring and magnification and in this way Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)  related the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself when He said in Surah Al Hajj (22:26):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِىَ لِلطَّآٮِٕفِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim (Abraham) the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Islamic Monotheism], and sanctify <span style="color:#ff0000;">My House</span> for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.);&#8221; )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said &#8216;My House&#8217; (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى). He narrated it it to Himself in the construct of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also He added to Himself the masaajid (the Mosques) as He said in Surah Al Baqarah (2:114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومن اظلم ممن منع مساجد الله ان يذكر فيها اسمه وسعى في خرابها اولئك ما كان لهم ان يدخلوها الا خائفين لهم في الدنيا خزي ولهم في الاخرة عذاب عظيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And who is more unjust than those who forbid Allah&#8217;s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in <span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah&#8217;s Mosques</span> and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah&#8217;s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see that now, Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) added the mosques in the  construct to Himself in the relation &#8216; &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Mosques&#8221; and also  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) He may do the same regarding some of his creatures in order to make clear His comprehensive possession as in His statement  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) in Surah Al Jasiya (45:13):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;وسخر لكم ما في السماوات وما في الارض جميعا منه ان في ذلك لايات لقوم يتفكرون&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him. Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore  in summary  Allah  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) referred the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself as an honour and magnification and no one should think that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) reffered the ka&#8217;abah to Himself because it is &#8220;a place in which He resides&#8221;. This is impossible because (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses everything and nothing from his creatures encompass Him, rather His Kursee(سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses the Heavens and the Earth, as Allah Stated in Surah Al Baqarah (2:255) that his Kursee extends over the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Surah Zumar (39:67):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وما قدروا الله حق قدره والارض جميعا قبضته يوم القيامة والسماوات مطويات بيمينه سبحان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is above His heavens ascended the throne in the most majestic way that befits Him and it&#8217;s not possible that He ( سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) dwells in any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on restoration of monuments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some newspapers have published articles on reviving and paying attention to monuments, written by some authors, including Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Salih Muhammad Jamal. </span>These articles have been responded to by His Eminence, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd. </span>He efficiently and instructively answered to the claims included therein, may Allah reward him. However, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anwar Abul-Jadayil, </span>may Allah guide and inspire him with what is right, was not satisfied with that reply or had not seen it. Therefore, he wrote an article on the subject, published by the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue number 5448, dated 22/4/1402 A.H. In this article, which is entitled &#8220;The Way of the Two Hijrahs&#8221;, he stated: &#8220;This is a review of the word published in the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue 5433, on 7/4/1402 A.H., by Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-Quddus Al-Ansary, </span>as a commentary on the investigation done by the researcher and man of letters, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-`Aziz Al-Rifa`y, </span>of the sites which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed through on his Hijrah (emigration) from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah </span>to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. </span>It urges us to stimulate officials to set signs indicating such posts such as, for example, two tents as close as possible to the two tents of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Um Ma`bad </span>with whatever else is suitable for the rest of posts, after taking the necessary precautions to prevent any transgression that could impart to them the tinge of sanctity or glory, and any deviation from the requirements of Shari`ah (Islamic law). For, the aim is to inform students, researchers and tourists who want to know about this path and these posts, to perceive the difficulties that the Messenger (peace be upon him) went through during this secret and covert trip.This is meant only to give lesson and example and inure people to hardships in Da`wah (calling people to Allah), following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">However, side roads should be built and paved, off the main roads, with rest houses for the tourists, making it easier for people to enter the places where the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed, starting with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Hira&#8217; Cave, </span>then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Thawr, </span>and the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was pursued by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Suraqah ibn Malik, </span>until we reach<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Quba&#8217;. </span>This should also include the preceding sites in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah, </span>such as Dar<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Arqam ibn Abul-Arqam, </span>the pass where he and his family were boycotted, the pathway he assumed during the Conquest of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then the places he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Abtah, </span>and also in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Hunayn, </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Badr. </span>This also applies to sites he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, </span>the battlefields of the conquests, and his places of presence in their rural areas, then his path to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Khaybar </span>and to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This is thus meant to provide people with more information about his unique efforts in spreading the Da`wah, and to teach them to follow the Prophet&#8217;s example in that regard.<strong> [End of quote]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Likewise, Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Faruq Akhdar </span>recommended in his article, published in Al-Jazirah newspaper, issue number 3354, dated 13/1/1402 A.H., the development of archaeological sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Muslims on a continuing basis, to ensure income; as he alleged that petrol reserves would run out. Maintaining his viewpoint, he stated<em> &#8220;that Christian religious tourism in the Vatican is one of the main sources of income in Italian economy. Israel sold empty bottles to the Jews in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> America, </span>under the claim that such bottles were full of holy air from Al Quds.&#8221;</em> He also pointed out that among the benefits this will bring about is that it will<em> &#8220;Engrave knowledge about Islam in the minds of Muslim children&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Due to the <strong>bad effects that reviving religious monuments have on the `Aqidah (creed)</strong>, I wanted to clarify the truth and corroborate the writings of scholars on this issue, cooperate with those scholars in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah), advise people for the Sake of Allah, expose suspicious points, and illustrate supporting evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Hence, I would like to say that taking care of monuments in the way mentioned above <strong>would lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>. This is because people&#8217;s souls are weak and are prone to cling to that which they deems beneficial. Besides, there are many types of Shirk, which are imperceptible for most people. Hence, those who stop at these monuments &#8211; whether they are real or fake monuments &#8211; will realize that ignorant people wipe themselves with the dirt of these places, and with the trees and stones therein. Those ignorant people also pray there and invoke those to whom the sites are attributed, thinking that this is a means of approaching Allah (Exalted be He), attaining Shafa`ah (intercession), and having theirs distresses relieved. Such an ignorance-based approach is maintained by misleading callers whose souls are impregnated with idolatry, and who exploit these monuments to misguide people and encourage them to visit these monuments in order to acquire some financial gains. Regretfully, there is no one at these monuments to inform people that they are meant only for people to derive an example. Rather, the opposite usually takes place. </span><span id="more-243"></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">This is evident to the wise people in some countries that are afflicted with the obsessive attachment to shrines, where people are accustomed to worshipping them besides Allah, and circumambulating them in the same way Muslims circumambulate</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Ka`bah, </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext that people entombed therein are Awliya&#8217; (pious people). So, how far worse would it be if they were told that such monuments are attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), knowing that Satan unremittingly seizes the most suitable times to mislead people, and therefore Allah (Exalted be He) says about him: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 82" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs(Satan)]said:ByYourMight,"></a>[Iblîs (Satan)] said:<em> &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all,</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 83" target="_blank" name="ExceptYourchosenslavesamongst"></a>&#8220;Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221;</span></em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> He (Exalted be He) also says about Satan, the enemy of Allah: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 16" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs)said:BecauseYouhave"></a>(Iblîs) said:<em> &#8220;Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 17" target="_blank" name="ThenIwillcometothemfrombefore"></a>&#8220;<em>Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).</em>&#8220;</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Satan deceived Adam (peace be upon him) and caused him to be driven out of Jannah (Paradise), although Allah (Exalted be He) had warned Adam against Satan, and showed him that Satan was his enemy, as</span><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in Surah (chapter) Ta-ha: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 121" target="_blank" name="Thentheybothateofthetree,"></a><em>Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 122" target="_blank" name="ThenhisLordchosehim,andturned"></a>Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Another example is the <strong>story of</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">with</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Al-Samiry</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">when he molded for them, out of their possessions, a calf to worship instead of Allah. Then, Satan made this act fair-seeming to them, although it was clearly false. It has been authentically reported in Jami` (Hadith Compilation of)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tirmidhy </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others through an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators) from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Abu Waqid Al-Laythy </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="WewentoutwiththeMessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10630" class="tip"></span>We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to Hunayn, when we had just recently left Kufr (disbelief). The Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in worship) had a lote-tree which they would frequent and would hang their swords upon. They called it &#8216;Dhat Anwat&#8217;. When we passed by a lote-tree, we said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have?&#8217; The Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great)! By the One (Allah) in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said what the Children of Israel said to Musa, &#8216;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8217; Certainly, you will follow the ways of those who came before you.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have&#8221; to that of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">who said: &#8220;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8221; This indicates that the meanings and purposes are what count, not merely the words. And due to the gravity of the crime of Shirk and its threats in ruining one&#8217;s work, we find the Khalil (beloved, close elect) of Allah, Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), invoke Allah to safeguard him and his children against Shirk. Allah (Exalted be He) says: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 35" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenIbr%C3%A2h%C3%AEm(Abraham)"></a>And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: &#8220;O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 36" target="_blank" name="OmyLord!Theyhaveindeedled"></a>O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> If the prophets and messengers &#8211; who are the best of creation, the most knowledgeable about Allah, and the most fearful of Him &#8211; were afraid of this, then others are more likely to fall into this trap. Hence, they should be warned of it, and all the means leading to it should be blocked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">No matter how much precautions or reservations the followers of the truth take, this will not protect the ignorant people from the corruptions that result from sanctifying monuments</span>. This is because people differ in terms of their understanding,</span><span style="color:#000000;">vulnerability, and their search for the truth to a great extent, and therefore</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the people of Nuh</span><span style="color:#000000;">(peace be upon him) worshipped Wadd, Suwa`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq and Nasra (these are the names of their idols), although the original purpose of hewing them out was to remind people of the good deeds of those individuals and thus encourage them to emulate these persons, not to idolize or worship them besides Allah. However, Satan misguided those who came after those people who carved such sculptures, and led them to worship these idols instead of Allah. This was the reason of Shirk among the Children of Adam, as was reported by</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bukhari </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be Merciful with him), in his Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Regarding</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings) of Allah&#8217;s saying: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Nuh, 71: 23" target="_blank" name="Andtheyhavesaid:%E2%80%98Youshall"></a>&#8220;<em>And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods: nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwâ‘, nor Yaghûth, nor Ya‘ûq nor Nasr’ (these are the names of their idols)</em>.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Ibn `Abbas was reported to have said that these are names of righteous men from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the <strong>people of Nuh</strong>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">He added that when they perished, Satan inspired their people to set statues in the seats where those righteous men used to sit, and to name the statues after the names of those people. Sure enough, they did it. Then, they were worshipped only after those who had made them perished and knowledge was discarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for examples from the <strong>practices of the Jews and Christians</strong>, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) ordered us to guard against their ways, because it is the path to aberration and loss. It is impermissible to imitate them in their ways since they contradict our Shari`ah. They were also known for their misguidance, following their own whims, distortion of what was revealed to them through their prophets. Due to these reasons and others, we are forbidden to imitate them or to copy their ways. Consequently, the corruption which would result from restoring and reviving monuments are inescapable, and none other than Allah (Exalted be He) can know the extent and types of their evil consequences. Therefore, it is Wajib (obligatory) to prevent the revival of monuments in order to avoid that which could lead to further corruption. It is known that the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him, and may Allah be pleased with them) were the most knowledgeable people regarding the Religion of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the slaves of Allah. However, they did not revive or sanctify these monuments, or even advise others to revive them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Rather, when<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people travel to the tree by which the Companions pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he orderedthat it be rooted out lest people would idolize it and thus stoop to worshipping it besides Allah. The Muslims thanked him for doing so and considered this as one of his commendable acts (may Allah be pleased with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, if reviving these monuments or visiting them were a lawful act, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have done so in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and after the Hijrah (Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) or ordered people to do so, or his Companions would have either done so themselves or recommended others to do it, knowing that it has been previously mentioned that they were the most knowledgeable among people of the Law of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the servants of Allah. It has not been proven that he (peace be upon him) or his Companions visited Hira&#8217; Cave when they were in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">or in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Thawr Cave. </span><span style="color:#000000;">They did not even do so during the `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), the Year of Conquest, or the Farewell Pilgrimage. Besides, they did not go to the place of the two tents of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Um Ma`bad </span><span style="color:#000000;">or the place of the tree of the pledge. Therefore, it became known that visiting these places, and paving the roads which lead to them is a newly-invented practice (in religion), which has no basis in the Law of Allah, and is among the gravest things that lead to major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). Since establishing buildings on graves and using them as Masjids (mosques) is one of the gravest matters that lead to Shirk, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade it, and he cursed the Jews and Christians for making the graves of their prophets places of worship, informing us that anyone who does so is the most evil of creatures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported in Sahih</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muslim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah Al-Bajaly </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Bewareofthosewhoprecededyou"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10699" class="tip"></span>Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as Masjids.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In addition, the perfect Shari`ah has indicated the obligation of blocking all verbal and practical means leading to Shirk, and scholars corroborated this with countless proofs. Among these proofs, the scholar</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in his book [I`lam Al-Muwaqi`in] ninety-nine proofs, all of which prove the obligation of blocking all the means leading to Shirk or to sins. Such proofs include Allah&#8217;s saying:</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 108" target="_blank" name="Andinsultnotthosewhomthey"></a>And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allâh, lest they insult Allâh wrongfully without knowledge.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> And the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="NoSalah(Prayer)istobeoffered"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24568" class="tip"></span>No Salah (Prayer) is to be offered after the Subh (Morning Prayer) until the sun rises, and no Salah is to be offered after `Asr (Afternoon Prayer) until the sun sets.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> This is meant to block the means leading to worship of the sun instead of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is also meant to prevent imitation of those who do such acts. Another mentioned proof is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and cursed those who do so. He (peace be upon him) also forbade the plastering of the graves, venerating them, and taking them as places of worship. Moreover, he forbade facing it in Salah or offering Salah there. Likewise, he (peace be upon him) ordered leveling them (to ground), and forbade that people light lamps on them or travel to them, so that this would not be a pretext to taking them as idols or associating them with Allah in worship. Indeed, this is deemed forbidden for all people, those who idolize them and those who do not mean to do so, in order to block the means leading evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">What is Wajib for the Muslim scholars and governors is to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in this and other matters. They are also obliged to forbid whatever the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade, and to prevent anything which could lead to Shirk, mischief, sin or idolization of the prophets and the Awliya&#8217; in order to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and block the means leading to Shirk. We ask Allah to mend the affairs of Muslims and grant them comprehension of the religion, and to guide Muslim scholars and governors to that which will bring about their prosperity and salvation in this world and the hereafter. We also ask Allah to guide the Muslim to act upon the Law of Allah in all affairs, and to place all Muslims on His Straight Path. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon His Servant and His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions and those who uprightly follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source:<em> Silsilat ul-ahaadeeth us-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations – <em>hadeeth </em>no. 43<br />
assaheeha translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “O <em>‘Aaisha</em>, if your people had not recently been polytheists (and new converts to <em>Islaam</em>), and if I had enough means to reconstruct it, I would have spent the treasure of the <em>Ka’bah</em> in the way of Allaah, and I would have demolished the <em>Ka’bah</em> and made it at a level with the ground. Then I would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em> (Abraham) and made two doors for it – a door facing the east, for the people to enter, and a door facing the west, for their exit… And I would expand (the <em>Ka’bah</em>) by six cubits (around three meters) of area from <em>al-Hijr</em> (the unroofed portion of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is at present in the form of a semi-circular, wall-surrounded area in the north side of the <em>Ka’bah</em>); (in [another] narration: I would have included the space of <em>al-Hijr</em> in it ), for when the <em>Quraish</em> had rebuilt the<em> Ka’bah</em>, they reduced its (area). And if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I could show you what they have left out of it.” He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] showed her about seven cubits (three and a half meters) of area (from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In [another] narration from her (<em>‘Aaisha</em>), she said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about the wall (i.e., <em>al-Hijr</em>): ‘Is it regarded as part of the House (the <em>Ka’bah</em>)?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] replied, ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘Then why did they not include it in the House?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people ran short of the means/money (to do so).’ I said: ‘Why is it that the level of its door is raised high?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people did it to admit whomever they liked, and prevent whomever they disliked; (in [another] narration: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to only whom they wished. So when a person intended to enter it, they called him to climb (the stairs), and when he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down). Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced<em> Islaam</em>) and were I not afraid that their hearts might deny (my action), then surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside (the building of) the House and I would have made its gate touch the ground.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> ruled, he demolished it and made two doors for it. (In [another] narration: That was what urged <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>to demolish (the <em>Ka’bah</em>). <em>Yazeed bin Rumaan</em> said: ‘I saw <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> when he demolished it, rebuilt it and included <em>al-Hijr </em>in it. And I saw the original foundations of <em>Ibraaheem</em> (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) which were of stones joined together resembling the humps of camels.’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh al-bukhaari </em>and<em> saheeh muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) summarizes a number of benefits from the above narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> indicates two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: that it is obligatory to delay carrying out rectification, if an evil greater than [its good] results from it. And from it, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em> took their famous principle: ‘<strong>Repelling the evil [comes] before bringing the good</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: that the honorable <em>Ka’bah</em> is now in need of the reconstructions that the <em>hadeeth</em> includes, due to the disappearance of the reason for the sake of which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) left that – and (the reason) is that the hearts of those who were recently polytheists in his time (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) would have a dislike [for it]. And <em>Ibn Battaal </em>has reported from some of the scholars that: ‘the dislike that he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) feared was that they would accuse him of boasting by himself over them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to list those reconstructions in what follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>1- Expanding the <em>Ka’bah</em> and building it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>), and that is by adding approximately six cubits (three meters) of <em>al-Hijr</em></li>
<li>2- Leveling its ground with the surface of the <em>Haram</em> (<em>Al-Masjid ul-Haraam</em>)</li>
<li>3- Opening another door for it from the Western side</li>
<li>4 – Making the two doors low with the ground to organize and facilitate entering it and exiting from it for everyone who wishes</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed,<em> ‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>) had carried out the fulfillment of this reconstruction completely during his rule in <em>Makkah</em>, but the unjust political administration returned the <em>Ka’bah</em> after him to its previous state!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the<em> shaykh </em>then mentions the following <em>hadeeth</em> as narrated by <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Nu’aym</em> on the authority of <em>‘Ataa</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The House was burnt during the time of <em>Yazeed bin Mu’aawiya</em> when the people of <em>Shaam</em> had fought (in <em>Makkah</em>), and it happened with it (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) what was (in store for it). <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> left it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of <em>Hajj</em>) – he wanted to encourage them or urge them on (to war) against the people of <em>Shaam</em>. When the people had arrived, he said to them, ‘O people, advise me about the <em>Ka’bah</em>. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it?’ <em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em> [<em>radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu</em>] said, ‘An idea has occurred to me, according to which I think that you should only repair whatever has been damaged for it, and leave the House (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em>, (and leave) the stones (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em> and upon which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent.’ So, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘If the house of any one of you was burnt, he would not be pleased until he had reconstructed it, then how about the House of your Lord (which is far more important than your house)?! Indeed, I will seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I will make up my mind about this affair.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people were suspicious and fearful that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb over it (for the purpose of demolishing it), until a man climbed it and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him and demolished it until they leveled it to the ground. Then, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> erected pillars and hung curtains on them until the walls were raised. And <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘Indeed I heard<em> ‘Aaisha </em>say that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the first portion of the <em>hadeeth</em> [mentioned in the beginning], then he said) – I today have the means to spend and I don’t fear the people (that they would protest against this change).’ So he expanded it by five cubits (around two and a half meters) of area from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em> until it appeared as the original foundation (upon which <em>Ibraaheem</em> had built the <em>Ka’bah</em>), and the people saw it; and it was upon this foundation that he raised the wall. The length of the <em>Ka’bah</em> was eighteen cubits (around nine meters), and when he had expanded it, he found it to be short (since the addition was made to its width, so naturally the length appeared to be small compared to its width). Therefore, he expanded its length by ten cubits (around five meters). He also constructed two doors, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> was killed, <em>al-Hajjaaj </em>wrote to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan </em>informing him about it, and telling him that <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) on the very foundation (which was laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em>) and which reliable persons among the people of <em>Makkah</em> had seen. Then, <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> wrote to him: ‘Indeed, we are not concerned with disgracing <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> in anything. As for what he added in the side of its length, keep it intact; and as for what he added from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>, return it to its (previous) foundation, and close up the door which he opened.’ Thus, he (<em>al-Hajjaaj</em>) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on its (previous) foundation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh</em><em> muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani</em> continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is what <em>al-Hajjaaj</em> the oppressor did by the command of<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> the mistaken one, and I don’t think that his regret later on clears him of his mistake. <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Na’eem</em> have also narrated from <em>‘Abdullaah bin ‘Ubayd</em> who said: <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> came to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan</em> as an envoy during his <em>Khilaafa</em> (Caliphate), and<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> said, ‘I don’t think that<em> Abu Habeeb</em> (i.e., <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>) heard from<em> ‘Aaisha</em> that which he claimed to hear from her.’ <em>Al-Haarith</em> said: ‘But yes, I [myself] heard it from her.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘You heard her saying what?’ He (<em>Al-Haarith</em>) said, ‘She said: the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ <em>‘Abd ul-Malik </em> said to <em>Al-Haarith</em>, ‘You heard her saying this?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ Then, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) scratched the ground with his staff for a while and then said, ‘I wish that I had left it and not changed [the reconstructions carried out by<em> Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is in [another] narration from them both (<em>Muslim and Abu Na’eem</em>) from <em>Abu Qaz’ah </em>that: While <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> <em>bin Marwaan </em>was going around the House, he at that time said, ‘May Allaah fight <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> since he uttered a lie upon the mother of the believers, saying: I heard her say: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ So, <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah bin Rabee’ah</em> said, ‘Don’t say this O leader of the believers, for I [myself] heard the mother of the believers saying this.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘If I had heard it before I demolished it (the <em>Ka’bah</em>), I would have left it upon what <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it was (obligatory) upon him, before the demolition, to verify and to <strong>ask the people of knowledge</strong> about that, whether it was allowed for him to criticize <em>‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr</em> and accuse him of uttering a lie upon the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And his truthfulness (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) became clear to<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> by <em>Al-Haarith</em>‘s agreeing with it, as many a group from <em>‘Aaisha</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>) agreed with it. And I have collected their narrations…in this <em>hadeeth</em>, and the <em>hadeeth</em> is detailed from<em> ‘Aaisha</em>. Therefore, I indeed fear that <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> had prior knowledge about the <em>hadeeth</em> before he demolished the House, but he pretended that he did not hear about it except through <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>. So when <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> opposed him, that he also had heard it (the <em>hadeeth</em>) from <em>‘Aaisha</em>, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) showed regret at what he had done, [but] it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it has reached us that there is an idea or plan to expand the area of <em>tawaaf </em>(circumambulation) around  the <em>Ka’bah</em> and transfer the <em>Maqaam Ibraaheem</em> (the Standing Place of <em>Ibraaheem</em>) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) to another place. So in relation to this, <strong>I suggest to those responsible (for the <em>Ka’bah</em>) that they hasten to expand the <em>Ka’bah</em> before everything (else) and rebuilt it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>)</strong>, fulfilling the noble, honorable Prophetic wish in this<em> hadeeth</em>, and saving the people from the problems of crowding at the door of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is witnessed every year, and from the domination of the guard over the door who prevents whoever he wishes from entering and allows whoever he wishes, for the sake of a few dirhams!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A History of Hajj (Pilgrimage)<br />
</strong>Invitation to Islam Newsletter, Issue 1, May 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj literally means &#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to set out for a place</strong></span>&#8216;. Islamically however it refers to the annual pilgrimage that Muslims make to Makkah with the intention of performing certain religious rites in accordance with the method prescribed by the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj and its rites were first ordained by Allaah in the time of the Prophet lbraaheem [Abraham] (alayhis-salaam) and he was the one who was entrusted by Allaah to build the Ka&#8217;ba &#8211; the House of Allaah &#8211; along with his son Ismaa&#8217;eel [Ishmael] at Makkah. Allaah described the Ka&#8217;ba and its building as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And remember when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the [Sacred] House [saying]: Associate not anything [in worship] with Me and purify My House for those who circumambulate it [i.e. perform tawaaf] and those who stand up for prayer and those who bow down and make prostration [in prayer etc.].&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah Al-Hajj 22:26</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After building the Ka&#8217;ba, Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) would come to Makkah to perform Hajj every year, and after his death, this practice was continued by his son</strong></span>. However, gradually with the passage of time, both the form and the goal of the Hajj rites were changed. As idolatry spread throughout Arabia , the Ka&#8217;ba lost its purity and idols were placed inside it. Its walls became covered with poems and paintings, including one of Jesus and his mother Maryam and eventually over 360 idols came to be placed around the Ka&#8217;ba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the Hajj period itself, the atmosphere around the sacred precincts of the Ka&#8217;ba was like a circus.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Men and women would go round the Ka&#8217;ba <strong>naked</strong>, arguing that they should present themselves before Allaah in the same condition they were born.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Their prayer became devoid of all sincere remembrance of Allaah and was instead reduced to a series of <strong>hand clapping, whistling and the blowing of horns</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Even the <strong>talbeeyah [2] was distorted</strong> by them with the following additions: <em>&#8216;No one is Your partner except one who is permitted by you. You are his Master and the Master of what he possesses&#8217;.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sacrifices were also made in the name of God. However, <strong>the blood of the sacrificed animals was poured onto the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and the flesh was hung from pillars around the Ka&#8217;ba</strong>, in the belief that Allaah demanded the flesh and blood of these animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Singing, drinking, adultery</strong> and other acts of immorality was rife amongst the pilgrims and the poetry competitions, which were held, were a major part of the whole Hajj event. In these competitions, poets would praise the bravery and splendour of their own tribesmen and tell exaggerated tales of the cowardice and miserliness of other tribes. Competitions in generosity were also staged where the chief of each tribe would set up huge cauldrons and feed the pilgrims, only so that they could become well-known for their extreme generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the people had totally abandoned the teachings of their forefather and leader Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). The House that he had made pure for the worship of Allaah alone, had been totally desecrated by the pagans and the rites which he had established were completely distorted by them. This sad state of affairs continued for nearly two and a half thousand years. But then after this long period, the time came for the supplication of Ibraaheem to be answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them your aayaat (verses) and instruct them in the book and the Wisdom and sanctify them. Verily you are the &#8216;Azeezul-Hakeem [the All-Mighty, the All-Wise].&#8221; </span>[<em>Surah Al-Baqarah 2:129</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sure enough, a man by the name of Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was born in the very city that Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) had made this supplication centuries earlier. For twenty-three years, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) spread the message of Tawheed [true monotheism] &#8211; the same message that Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets came with &#8211; and established the law of Allaah upon the land. He expended every effort into making the word of Allaah supreme and his victory over falsehood culminated in the smashing of the idols inside the Ka&#8217;ba which once again became the universal centre for the worshippers of the one True God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only did the Prophet rid the Ka&#8217;ba of all its impurities, but he also reinstated all the rites of Hajj which were established by Allaah&#8217;s Permission, in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). Specific injunctions in the Qur&#8217;aan were revealed in order to eliminate all the false rites which had become rampant in the pre-Islamic period. All indecent and shameful acts were strictly banned in Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;There is to be no lewdness nor wrangles during Hajj.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions among poets in the exaltations of their forefathers and their tribesmen&#8217;s&#8217; achievements were all stopped. Instead, Allaah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And when you have completed your rites [of Hajj] then remember Allah as you remember your forefathers; nay with a more vigorous remembrance.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:200</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions in generosity were also prohibited. Of course, the feeding of the poor pilgrims was still encouraged as this was done in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) but Allaah commanded that the slaughtering of the animals which was done for this purpose should be done seeking the pleasure of Allaah rather than fame and the praise of the people. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So mention the name of Allaah over these animals when they are drawn up in lines. Then, when they are drawn on their sides [after the slaughter], eat thereof and feed the beggar who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:36</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the deplorable practice of spattering blood of the sacrificed animals on the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and hanging their flesh on alters, then Allaah clearly informed them that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is Taqwaa (piety) from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:37</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also put a stop to the practice of circling the Ka&#8217;ba in a state of nudity and the argument that the pagans put forward to justify this ritual was sharply rebutted in Allaah&#8217;s question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Say: Who has forbidden the adornment [i.e. clothes] given by Allaah which He has produced for His Slaves?&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:32</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another custom which was prohibited through the Qur&#8217;aan was that of setting off for Hajj without taking any provisions for the journey. In the pre-Islamic period, some people who claimed to be <strong>mutawakkiloon</strong> (those having complete trust in Allaah) would travel to perform Hajj begging food the whole journey. They considered this form of behaviour a sign of piety and an indication of how much faith they had in Allaah. However Allaah told mankind that to have sufficient provisions for the journey was one of the preconditions for making Hajj. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And take a provision [with you] for the journey, but the best provision is at-Taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, all the pre-Islamic practices, which were based in ignorance, were abolished and Hajj was once more made a model of piety, fear of Allaah, purity, simplicity and austerity. Now, when the pilgrims reached the Ka&#8217;ba, they no longer found the carnivals and the frolic and frivolity that had once occupied the minds of the pilgrims there before. Now, there was the remembrance of Allaah at every step and every action and every sacrifice was devoted to Him alone. It was this kind of Hajj that was worthy of the reward of paradise, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <em>&#8220;The reward for an accepted Hajj is nothing less than paradise.&#8221; </em>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah grant us all the ability to visit His House and perform the Hajj in the manner of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:Are there any authentic Hadeeths that mention the virtues of Zamzam water?<strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are Hadeeths which indicate that Zamzam water is noble and blessed. In a Hadeeth confirmed in the Sahih, the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said about Zamzam water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is blessed, and that like food, it fills.&#8221; (Muslim no. 2473)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Abu Dawud&#8217;s narration, there is this addition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And a cure for illness.&#8221; (Abu Dawud At-Tiyalsi 2nd Volume no. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Hadeeth proves its virtues, that it is a <strong>filling food, a cure for illness, and that it is blessed.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is to drink it as the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) drank it, but it is also <em><strong>permissible to make ablution with it, to use it to purify yourself after you have relieved yourself, and if necessary, to take a shower using it when you are Junub (impure).</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that on one occasion, water poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, and then people took what they needed from that water, using it to drink, to make ablution, to wash their clothes, or to purify themselves after relieving themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zamzam water may not be the same as the water that poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, but it is also not more blessed, for each has its place as pure water. If it is permissible to use the water that miraculously poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers for all the purposes mentioned above, then it is also permissible in the case of Zamzam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b> ( from Rites of Hajj and Umrah &#8211; by Shaik Nasiruddin Albanee )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;<strong>This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door</strong>. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed, although it was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (i.e. that was not narrated in a saheeh hadeeth, as the ahaadeeth that were narrated concerning this were deemed to be da’eef or weak). Rather it was narrated from some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). So is iltizaam (clinging) Sunnah? When should it be done – upon arrival or when about to leave, or at any time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this difference of opinion among the scholars is that it is not narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to do that when they arrived in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fuqaha’ said: He (the pilgrim) should do that when about to leave, and should cling to the multazam, which is the area between the corner where the Black Stone is located and the door…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, there is nothing wrong with iltizaam (clinging to the Ka’bah in this area) so long as that does not involve annoying others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/402, 403.</p>

I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.&#8221; The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes</strong></span>.&#8221; [Narrated by <em>Imam</em> Muslim, 2473]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘<strong>al-Mukkarama</strong>’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Takbir, then du&#8217;aa to Allaah after praying two rak&#8217;ah inside the Ka&#8217;bah (Hijr) is a Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: Is salat inside the Ka&#8217;bah in any way superior to salat outside it, and is it permissible for a person to speak of what he has seen inside the ka&#8217;bah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by The Permanent Committee: Salat inside the Ka&#8217;bah is preferred, if it is possible to do so without any inconvenience, difficulty or harm to anyone, as the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) entered it and prayed therein, according to an authentic narration in the Sahihain (Two Sahihs). And it has been reported from him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he came out one day looking sad, and he said: &#8220;<strong>Verily, I fear that I may have placed a burden upon my Ummah (i.e. by entering the ka&#8217;bah).</strong>&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when &#8216;A`ishah (radiallaahu &#8216;anha) asked him about salat in the Ka&#8217;bah, he said: &#8220;<strong>Pray in the Hijr, because it is a part of the House.</strong>&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This proves that salat inside the Ka&#8217;bah is preferred and is a means of drawing close (to Allaah) and an act of obedience, and in it is great merit.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is not fitting that there should be crowding, or harm, or doing anything which causes difficulty to him or to the people. It is enough for him to pray in the Hijr, because it is a part of the House; and there is no objection to speaking about what he has seen inside the Ka&#8217;bah, such as its inscriptions, or what is on its ceiling or the like. There is no objection to a person talking and saying: &#8220;I saw such and such and such and such.&#8221; There is no sin in that.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Sunnah, when one enters the Ka&#8217;bah, is to pray two rak&#8217;ahs and to say &#8220;Allaahu Akbar&#8221; and invoke Allaah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful with whatever supplications are easy for him at the end of it, especially those which have been reported (from the Prophet, salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) because the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) entered the Ka&#8217;bah and prayed therein, then he performed Takbir and supplicated Allaah. All of this has been authentically reported from him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam).</p></blockquote>
