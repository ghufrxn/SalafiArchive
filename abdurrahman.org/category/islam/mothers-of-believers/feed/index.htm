<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do not say anything about any of the Mothers of the Believers [1] (<em>radi Allaahu anhunna</em>) except good</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] This is the term of respect used for all the wives of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). This is how they have been termed in Soorah al-Ahzaab, Aayah number 6.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 33:6)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the “The Sealed Nectar” book</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 1. Khadijah Bint Khuwailid:</strong> In Makkah — prior to Hijra — the Prophet’s household comprised him (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his wife Khadijah bint Khuwailid. He was twenty-five and she was forty when they got married. She was the first woman he married. She was the only wife he had till she died. He had sons and daughters with her. None of their sons lived long. They all died. Their daughters were Zainab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zainab was married to her maternal cousin Abu Al-‘As bin Al-Rabi‘ and that was before Al-Hijra. Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum were both married to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; successively (i.e. he married one after the death of her sister). Fatimah was married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib; and that was in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The sons and daughters that Fatimah and ‘Ali had were Al-Hasan, Al-Husain, Zainab and Umm Kulthum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) was exceptionally authorized to have more than four wives for various reasons. The wives he married were thirteen. Nine of them outlived him. Two died in his lifetime: Khadijah and the Mother of the poor (<em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>) — Zainab bint Khuzaima, besides two others with whom he did not consummate his marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Sawdah bint Zam‘a:</strong> He married her in Shawwal, in the tenth year of Prophethood, a few days after the death of Khadijah. Prior to that, she was married to a paternal cousin of hers called As-Sakran bin ‘Amr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 3. ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr:</strong> He married her in the eleventh year of Prophethood, a year after his marriage to Sawdah, and two years and five months before Al-Hijra. She was six years old when he married her. However, he did not consummate the marriage with her till Shawwal seven months after Al-Hijra, and that was in Madinah. She was nine then. She was the only virgin he married, and the most beloved creature to him. As a woman she was the most learnèd woman in jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 4. Hafsah bint ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab:</strong> She was <em>Aiyim</em> (i.e. husbandless). Her ex-husband was Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in the third year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 5. Zainab bint Khuzaimah:</strong> She was from Bani Hilal bin ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a. Was nicknamed <em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>, because of her kindness and care towards them. She used to be the wife of ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was martyred at Uhud, was married to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the fourth year of Al-Hijra, but she died two or three months after her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 6. Umm Salamah Hind bint Abi Omaiyah:</strong> She used to be the wife of Abu Salamah, who died in Jumada Al-Akhir, in the fourth year of Al-Hijra. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Shawwal of the same year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 7. Zainab bint Jahsh bin Riyab:</strong> She was from Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah and was the Messenger’s paternal cousin. She was married to Zaid bin Haritha — who was then considered son of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . However, Zaid divorced her. Allâh sent down some Qur’ânic verses with this respect:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e., divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About her, Allâh has sent down some verses of <em>Al-Ahzab</em> Chapter that discussed the adoption of children in detail — anyway we will discuss this later. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Dhul-Qa‘dah, the fifth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8. Juwairiyah bint Al-Harith: </strong> Al-Harith was the head of Bani Al-Mustaliq of Khuza‘ah. Juwairiyah was among the booty that fell to the Muslims from Bani Al-Mustaliq. She was a portion of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas’ share. He made her a covenant to set her free at a certain time. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) accomplished the covenant and married her in Sha‘ban in the sixth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 9. Umm Habibah:</strong> Ramlah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan. She was married to ‘Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. She migrated with him to Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). When ‘Ubaidullah apostatized and became a Christian, she stoodfast to her religion and refused to convert. However ‘Ubaidullah died there in Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to Negus, the king, asking him for Umm Habibah’s hand — that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra. Negus agreed and sent her to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the company of Sharhabeel bin Hasnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 10. Safiyah bint Huyai bin Akhtab:</strong> From the Children of Israel, she was among the booty taken at Khaibar battle. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) took her for himself. He set her free and married her after that conquest in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 11. Maimunah bint Al-Harith:</strong> The daughter of Al-Harith, and the sister of Umm Al-Fadl Lubabah bint Al-Harith. The Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her after the Compensatory <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage). That was in Dhul-Qa‘dah in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the eleven women that the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had married and consummated marriage with them. He outlived two of them — Khadijah and Zainab, the <em>Umm Al-Masakeen.</em> Whereas the other nine wives outlived him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two wives that he did not consummate marriage with were, one from Bani Kilab and the other from Kindah and this was the one called Al-Jauniyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides these, he had two concubines. The first was Mariyah, the Coptic (an Egyptian Christian), a present gift from Al-Muqauqis, vicegerent of Egypt — she gave birth to his son Ibrâhim, who died in Madinah while still a little child, on the28 th or29 th of Shawwal in the year 10A.H., i.e.27 th January, 632 A.D. The second one was Raihanah bint Zaid An-Nadriyah or Quraziyah, a captive from Bani Quraiza. Some people say she was one of his wives. However, Ibn Al-Qaiyim gives more weight to the first version. Abu ‘Ubaidah spoke of two more concubines, Jameelah, a captive, and another one, a bondwoman granted to him by Zainab bint Jahsh.[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever meditates on the life of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , will conceive that his marriage to this great number of women in the late years of his lifetime, after he had almost spent thirty years of his best days of youth sufficing himself to one old wife — Khadijah and later on to Sawdah, was in no way an overwhelming lustful desire to be satisfied through such a number of wives. These marriages were in fact motivated by aims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what normal marriages usually aim at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tendency of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) towards establishing a relationship by marriage with both Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and his marriage to ‘Aishah and Hafsah — and getting his daughter Fatimah married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and the marriage of his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that he aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and great achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights against alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and degradation to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) wanted to demolish or break down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-Waleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the Messenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a short time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father, did not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah and Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility against Islam. Better still, Juwairiyah, herself, was one of the greatest sources of blessing to her own people. On the occasion of her marriage to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , his Companions set a hundred families of her people free. They said: &#8220;It is for their affinity with the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .&#8221; No need to say what great good impression this gratitude had on everybody’s soul. One of the greatest motives of all is Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had known nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach them to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the solidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and women. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is impossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had to select some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them systematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, and thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The Mothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) ) were in such a convenient position that they could convey the state of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his affairs to people (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of Islam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in conveying Prophetic traditions <em>Ahadith</em> to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related a large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which aimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of children. In <em>Al-Jahiliyah</em> the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a real son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That <em>Jahiliyah</em> tradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or uproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those concerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and brought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against such deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to marry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance with Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when the Confederates (<em>Al-Ahzab</em>) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) feared that the hypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to influence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce her, in order not to get involved into that trial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had been sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; — the freed slave of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) too) have done favour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that you should fear him.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her at the time he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her <em>Iddat</em> (i.e. period during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had already ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the marriage Himself by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them).&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was in order to break down the tradition of child adoption in practice after He had done it in words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just near Allâh.&#8221; [33:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ( saw) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the last (end) of the Prophets.&#8221; [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lots of deeply-rooted traditions cannot be uprooted or demolished or even adjusted by mere words. They must be matched and associated with the action of the advocate of the Message himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be perceived through the deeds practised by the Muslims at Al-Hudaibiyah <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage) during which ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Al-Thaqafi saw certain Muslims tend to pick up any expectoration that fell down from the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . He also saw them race to the water of his ablution and they almost quarrelled for it. There were others who competed to pledge allegiance to death and some others pledged not to flee from (the battlefield). Among those people, were eminent Companions like ‘Umar and Abu Bakr, who although dedicated all their lives to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and to the cause of Islam, but refused to carry out the Messenger’s ordres with respect to slaughtering sacrificial animals after the ratification of Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty, the thing that perturbed and caused the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to feel anxious. However, when Umm Salamah &#8211; may Allah be pleased with her &#8211; advised that he take the initiative and sacrifice his animals, his followers raced to follow his example; a clear evidence in support of the saying: Actions speak louder than words, in the process of exterminating a deeply-established tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hypocrites aroused a lot of suspicions and made a broad false propaganda against that marriage. Their acts and talks about that marriage had ill-effects on those Muslims whose Faith was still weak, particularly that Zainab was the fifth wife — and the Noble Qur’ân limited the number up to four only; Zaid was traditionally his son, and so a father marrying his son’s divorcee was a heinous sin in the eyes of the Arabians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Al-AhzabSurah</em> was revealed to shed full light on the two issues, i.e. Islam does not recognize adoption of children, and the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is given (by Allâh) more freedom as regards the number of wives he can hold than other Muslims in order to achieve noble and honourable purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the treatment of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to his wives was of honourable, noble, and superb nature. His wives were on tops in respect of honour, satisfaction, patience, modesty, and service (that is to say the performance of housework and marriage duties). Although the Messenger’s house-life was hard and unbearable, none of his wives complained. Anas said about the Prophet’s life: &#8220;According to my knowledge, the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) has never tasted a thin flattened loaf in all his lifetime, nor has he ever seen with his own eyes roasted mutton.&#8221;[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aishah said: &#8220;Over two months have elapsed — during which we have seen three crescents — and yet no fire has been kindled in the houses of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) (i.e. they did not cook food).&#8221; &#8220;What did you eat to sustain yourselves?&#8221; ‘Urwah asked. She said &#8220;The two blacks: dates and water&#8221;[]. Lots of information about the hard life of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) were told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of these hardships, straits and adversity of life in the house of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam), none of his wives uttered a word of complaint worthy of reproach — but once. This exception was required by human instinctive inclinations. However, it was not so important and consequently it did not require the decree of a legislative rule. Allâh has given them an opportunity to choose between two things, as clearly stated in the following verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet (Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam)! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, — then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce). But if you desire Allâh and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared for <em>Al-Muhsinat</em> (good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’&#8221; [33:28,29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and its glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that normally happen among co-wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could be the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that, so they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in <em>At-Tahreem</em> Chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful to you …&#8221; [66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is familiar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their sorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the trials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their disregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness of polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill-practices featuring it, could truthfully justify the existence and practice of polygamy. In this, there are Divine signs for all people possessed of lucid mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">She was the first wife of the Prophet and the first heart to be affected and to accept his call to Islâm. She was Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid. When she reached adolescence, she came to be known as Taahira (righteous, virtuous) due to her noble and sublime character. (Al-Isaabah of Ibn Hajr (8/60))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She was married but soon both her father and husband died, leaving her in charge of the trade. Khadeejah became a business woman in her own right, know and respected throughout the Qur&#8217;aysh (The noblest tribe in Makkah; they were the keepers of the Ka&#8217;bah and the tribe that Khadeejah &amp; the Prophet came from) for her noble character, wealth and good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She heard the Prophet&#8217;s fair dealings and how he was acclaimed to be al-Ameen (the trustworthy) amongst the people, and so she asked if he could accompany her merchandise to its various destinations &#8211; he agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the age of twenty-five, the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted the proposal of Khadeejah, his distant cousin, who was fifteen years his senior. They had six children: two sons, Qaasim and &#8216;Abdullaah, both of whom died in infancy, and four daughters, Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthoom, and Faatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fifteen years later, what do we find Khadeejah saying when the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came to her with his heart trembling after receiving the first Revelation? He informed her of the happening and said to her &#8220;O Khadeejah what has happened to me? I fear for myself?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;It can&#8217;t be. Be happy. I swear by Allâh that he will never humiliate you. By Allaah, you join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people&#8217;s burdens, you help the destitute, you entertain guests and you help the vicissitudes which affect the people.&#8221; (Reported by &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &amp; collected by Muslim (eng. Trans vol.1 pp.96-8 no.301). Imaam an-Nawaawee, who wrote the commentary on Saheeh Muslim said that the scholars have explained Khadeejah&#8217;s statement by saying that she knew that Allâh would never allow one who had been given such a generous character and noble manners by Him, to be affected by madness, since good manners is itself such a blessing from Allaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at her conviction in what the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said. Pause for a moment and note her weighty words. She didn&#8217;t doubt him, nor show the slightest hesitation towards the words he uttered. In fact she was his greatest source of comfort, the first to provide security for him and be sincere to him. He attested to the messengership of her husband and was the first to believe in him, and who could have known him better? After all, she had been married to him for fifteen years. She was convinced that it could only be one of such eloquent character who could be worthy of revelation from Allâh and thus hers was the first heart to be moved, and to accept Islâm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, her loyalty and assistance didn&#8217;t culminize there. By accepting and supporting his call to the worship of Allâh alone, Khadeejah, a woman highly esteemed among the Qur&#8217;aysh, was now denouncing their way of life, and the Qur&#8217;aysh were a proud and affluent people; and Makkah was at the heart of trading and the home of the idols &#8211; much revered by the Qur&#8217;aysh. They were not going to stand back and allow a man to now come and preach a way of life alien to theirs, rejecting their beliefs and everything they stood for. And remember when Islâm was first cultivated, the Muslims were small in number, and, in such a trying period, Khadeejah remained alongside the Messenger of Allâh in support whenever the Qur&#8217;aysh disclaimed him or contracted hostility towards him. She assisted him in preaching the words of Allâh and hence witnessed the division between the people of faith (eemaan) and those of disbelief (kufr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This continued until her death on the eleventh of Ramadaan in the tenth year of the Prophethood &#8211; at the age of sixty-four. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam would think of Khadeejah often. Open up any book written on the life of the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and you will not fail to find Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid mentioned and evidences pertaining to her excellence. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <em> &#8220;Sufficient for you, from the women of the worlds are, Maryam bint Ibraaheem [the mother of Eesaa], Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid, Faatimah bint Muhammad [sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam] and &#8216;Aasiyah, the wife of Fir&#8217;awn [Pharoah].&#8221; </em>(Saheeh &#8211; Reported by Anas in Ahmad, at-Tirmidhee &amp; others. Declared authentic by al-Albaanee in his Tarteeb Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217; (no.18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further proof of the Prophet&#8217;s inherent love for Khadeejah can be seen in &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah&#8217;s statement: &#8220;I was not so jealous of any of the Prophet&#8217;s wives as I was of Khadeejah. I never saw her, but he frequently mentioned her and he would often kill a sheep, cut it in pieces and send them round among Khadeejah&#8217;s friends. I often said to him: &#8216;It seems as if Khadeejah was the only woman in the world!&#8217; And he replied: &#8216;<em> She was indeed a fine woman and I had children from her.&#8221;</em> (Collected by al-Bukhaaree (eng. Trans. Vol.5 p.104 no.166) &amp; Muslim (eng. Trans. Vol.4 p.1297 no.5972))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we have the perfect role models, and it is only through reading about them, that we can truly love them and love to be like them, and understand why they are happy occupants of al-Jannah. And Jibreel, &#8216;alayhis-Salaam, came with the good news from Allaah, saying to the Messenger, sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, <em> &#8220;When she [Khadeejah] comes, give her a greeting from her Lord and me, and give her the good news that in Jannah she will have a house of brilliant pearls, in which there will be no clamor or toil.&#8221; </em>(Reported by Abu Hurayrah &amp; collected by al-Bukhaaree (vol.5 pp.104-5 no.168) &amp; Muslim (vol.4 p.1297 no.5967))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allâh be pleased with her and grant us all ability to be like her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aameen.</p>
