<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 73 : Point 123</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Means of earning whose correctness is clear to you are permissible, except for that whose corruptness become apparent. If it is corrupt, then he takes from that which is corrupt, the amount that is sufficient to sustain himself and (he) should not say, “<em>I shall abandon all earnings and just take what people will give to me</em>.” The Companions didn&#8217;t do this, nor the scholars up to this time of ours. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radiallaahu anhu) said, “<em>Earnings of which a part is from a lowly source are  better than being in need of the people</em>” </strong>[1].</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 73 : Point 122</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know, May Allah have mercy upon you! that the wealth of a Muslim is not permissible to take except for that which he gives willingly </strong>[1]<strong>. If a man has some wealth that was illegally acquired, then he is responsible for it. It is not permissible for anyone to take any thing from him, except with his permission. So perhaps he will repent and wish to restore it to its rightful owner, and you will have taken something unlawful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[The following article has been extracted from Al-Ibaanah e-Book :<br />
<a title="Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children : Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/fleshblood/">Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children</a> – Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool ]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that children are a source of trials (<i>fitnah</i>).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that surely, with </b><b>Allaah is a mighty reward.” </b>[Surah Al-Anfaal 8: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is stated in <i>Adwaa-ul-Bayaan</i>: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah ordered the people in this noble ayah to be aware that their properties and children are a trial for them by which they will be tested. Will your wealth and your children be a cause for you to fall into that which Allaah is displeased with?! Elsewhere (in the Qur’aan), He adds to this saying that wives are also a trial just like wealth and children, thus ordering the individual to beware of them putting him into that which Allaah is not pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He orders the individual – if he should see something he dislikes from these enemies who are the closest and most special of people to him, i.e. his children and wives – to forgive them, pardon them and not hold them accountable. So he should beware of them firstly and then pardon them if some thing should occur from them. This is found in His statement in Surah At-Taghaabun:</p>
<p>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَادِكُمْ عَدُوًّا لَّكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ ۚ وَإِن تَعْفُوا وَتَصْفَحُوا وَتَغْفِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ &#8211; 64:14</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ &#8211; 64:15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, verily among your wives and your children are enemies for you, so </b><b>beware of them. But if you pardon (them) and overlook and forgive (their faults), then </b><b>verily, Allaah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful. Your wealth and your children are only a </b><b>trial, whereas Allaah – with Him is a great reward.’ </b>[Surah At-Taghaabun 64: 14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asserts somewhere else (in the Qur’aan) that it is forbidden for the believers to let their wealth and children divert them from His Remembrance, stating that whoever let’s this happen is a loser who has been duped out of his shares. The ayah being referred to is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ &#8211; 63:9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, let not your properties or your children divert you from the </b><b>Remembrance of Allaah. And whosoever does that, they are the losers.’ </b>[Surah AlMunaafiqoon 63: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b>‘fitnah’</b>, as mentioned in these verses, means a trial and a test. This is one of the many meanings this word possesses in the Qur’aan.” [28]</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither the wife nor the children of an individual will pick up the burden of his shortcomings and deficiencies on his behalf. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَامُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ ۚ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ &#8211; 60:3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Neither your relatives nor your children will be of avail to you on the Day of </b><b>Resurrection. He will judge between you. And Allaah is All-Seer of what you do.” </b>[Surah Al-Mumtahanah 60: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So children are a source of <i>fitnah </i>– they are a trial and a test. Allaah will test us by them. So we should fear Allaah with regard to them and give them the proper rights that they deserve. Or should we forfeit these rights, when Allaah will ask us about them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (rahimahullah) reported: ‘Ubaidullaah bin Ziyad went to visit Ma’qil bin Yassaar while he was suffering from the illness that he eventually died from. So Ma’qil said: “I will indeed narrate a hadeeth to you that I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . I heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘There is no servant whom Allaah has granted responsibility over a group of </b><b>people, then fails to look after them in an honest manner, except that he will not </b><b>experience the fragrance of Paradise.’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There is no servant whom Allaah has granted </b><b>responsibility over a group of people, then dies on the day that he dies whilst in a state </b><b>of deceiving his people, except that Allaah makes Paradise forbidden for him.” [</b>29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Children are a source for causing one to divert away from the Remembrance of Allaah. At times, they may even lead you to disobey Him. In these cases, they are an enemy that you should beware of!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has instructed us how to expiate this <i>fitnah</i>. Hudhaifah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported: “We were sitting one day with ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said:‘<b>A man’s trials with regard to his </b><b>family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, </b><b>and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>” [30]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The tenth door is Material Means :</strong> The Sheikh says from those means are those material means like for instance being a farmer, a merchant or a manufacturer – any means from the material means as long as you don’t destroy yourself. You were not created for the purpose of the Dunya. You were created for the purpose of Allaah (azza wa jal) i.e for the purpose of worship and the most important thing is satisfaction and continence, i.e self-control with regards to passions and seeking self-sufficiency from Allaah and satisfaction in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you know that some people only have a motor and Allaah made his sustenance from that –– the sustenance of his family, that one motor. And some of them a donkey, and some people from villages have only one donkey and he spends from that for his whole family. Some a camel, some an ox —- he tilts for the people and supports the family. And for some of them an electric tool, or pliers and support from this a whole family. Some of them have 3, 4, 5, items in his possessions, he sells and spends on his family. And others have miswaak and he spends on his family. And another has perfume of antimony (khul) and he spends on his family. So it is more a means that you work by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you would say : ‘O Allaah this is the dua and it is upon You to answer it.’ In the same way you say : ‘O Allaah this is the means and it is upon You to provide for me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>You don’t depend upon the means.</strong></span> Because if you depend upon the means and only the means then you would have depended or put your trust in other than Allaah — and this is not permissible. This is a mere means. If it wasn’t for the fact that Allaah ordered us to take towards the means, we would have not taken towards it. However, it is an order of Allaah and look at Maryam (alaihissalam) while she was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says to her :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">‘And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. ‘</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this state of pregnancy while being weak and with that He still said : ‘Shake the trunk of the date palm towards you.’ There must be working by the means. Work by the means. We are not dervishes — people that do nothing. We are Muslims and people of daleel and people of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. We work by the means — in a safe correct means that which does not come in conflict with the deen. i.e. the means is not something unlegislated by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One person who might say, ‘we steal’ and this is a means. The other may say, ‘we fornicate’ and this is a means. Another sells intoxicants and says ‘this is a means.’ These means are unlegislated, forbidden. Or asks for bribes or robs or plunders and says ‘this is a means’ or cheats and deceives and says ‘this is a means.’ No, there must be with regards to the means that they have to be legislated from what Allaah has made halaal, not being any disobedience in it, not having any opposition to the deen of Allaah. He mentioned the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">‘And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. ‘</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sheikh reiterates that every time he entered the mihrab — the praying place of the private room, he (Zakariya) found her (Maryam) supplied with sustenance even though Allaah told us this about her. He found with her sustenance. He (Zakariya) said : O Maryam, from where did you get this? She said : From Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills without limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at that time Zakariyya invoked his Lord. If you work with the legislated, trusted means, you are trusting in Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) and by Allaah your rizq will come to you, no doubt. And I have put forward for you examples and Allaah puts forward parables for the people so they can reflect. I said to you : a person spends on his family by selling ‘miswaak and that one spends on his family by being a seller of oil, and that one a seller of ghee and that one a seller of honey and that one is a seller of wheat. He sells wheat and that one is a ‘bazzaar’ and he sells seeds. The books of biographies are filled with this, that of our pious predecessors. And that one is ‘al-Kayyaal’ — he has a scale and he weighs things for people and they pay him and that one fixes shoes, nails it and ties it. Up until now all what I mentioned is present and it is a sign from the signs of Allaah and ar-Razzaaq, He is Allaah (azzawajal) and you may very well find that a person who fixes shoes is in a state of self-contentment than a big merchant and a big manager. Or a ‘sayy aathi’ —- the one who fixes watches and sells watches. You may very well find him in a state of contentment. He has 4 watches in his possessions and he sells it, goes home and is comfortable. You may not find this self-contentment with a merchant or a big manager. Each one of them — his head is filled with problems and he doesn’t find comfort in his sleep and is not patient, and is not resting. Everything is preoccupation and stress and a lot of them become victims to diabetes, cancer and asthma. The other one is comfortable i.e the one who sells honey, wheat, watches etc. He is content with himself. He is not concerned with taxes or he is not concerned with the rent of a store or show room. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the most important thing is self-contentment.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura’an and of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called ‘Abwaabur Rizq’ or ‘Abwaabul Furaj’ i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say ‘Abwaabul Rizq’ – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say ‘Asbaabur Rizq’ i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura’an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah)</strong> : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the ‘Asbaab-al-Shar’eeah’ – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn’t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘We made all things living from water.’</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘That is verily those who say, “Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, ‘have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. ‘</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Ibn al Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book ‘Zaad al-Maad’ that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid’ah, no khurafaath (superstitions &amp; folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no ‘liwaath’ — no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no ‘shahaadatuz zoor’ — bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn’t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The eighth door of sustenance : As-Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Charitable donations, and <em><strong>nafaqaath</strong> </em>(regular spending) – you spend on yourself, on your wife, on your children, on your father and your mother, on your uncles and aunts, on your righteous neighbours, on sons and daughters, relatives, widows and orphans – this type of charity, the affair of this is great with Allaah. This is a means of accumulation of provision, a door from the doors of sustenance.</p>
<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no day on which the people get up but two angels come down and one of them says, ‘O Allaah, give in compensation to the one who spends (in charity),’ and the other says, ‘O Allaah, destroy the one who withholds.’”  </strong></span></p>
<p>[Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1374; Muslim, 1010.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So try and not make a day pass from you from the days of Allaah except that you stretch your hand as much as it is in your ability to do, even if it is a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said : <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Fear Allaah even if it is with half a date.’ </strong></span>[Muttafaqun alai &#8211; agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘fa mai ya’mal misqaala zarrathin kharrai yara. Wamai ya’mal misqaala zarrathin sharrai yara’ — ‘that whoever does an atoms worth of good he will see it</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) also says,<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Whatever you spend in the way of Allaah, He will replace it and He is the best of the Providers.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of <strong>‘He will replace it?</strong>’ i.e He will give you what is better than it. Don’t think that is the end &amp; that it has gone from you. It will return to you with that which is better, insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : Whatever you have spent, then Allaah will replace it for you and He is the Best of Providers. And he says again that : <strong>O Allaah give the person that spends a replacement that is replaced for him with good, O Lord of the worlds.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that Msulim related that the Messenger of Allaah said : that there was people from people that were from before you a man who had a garden. And another man heard a cry from the sky, an angel from the clouds who said, ‘give water to the garden of so and so.’ So he poured into it some water into one of the irrigation holes and then the water ran into that garden. So the person who owned the garden, he had a shovel in his hand and he was fixing the water and fixing the dirt and this man said to the man who owned the garden, ‘may Allaah have mercy upon you. What is your name?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: I am so and so, the son of so and so. Then he said: ‘Why do you ask?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ” I heard a voice from the clouds saying, ‘give water to the garden of so and so. May Allaah have mercy on you. What do you do with this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the owner of the garden says : ‘When I plant and then I harvest, I take one-third for me and my family and  I put one-third to roll it back into my garden and I give one-third  in charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at this. What is required from him is only a one-10th of the farm that is if it comes from natural torrential streams and the like (without any artificial irrigation or water). And a half of the 10th if it is water with sprinklers and irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So rather than giving 1/10th or half of 1/10th, he gave 1/3rd. Meaning he put aside more for charity. So see how Allaah singled him out with rain especially for his garden. Rain specific for him over his neighbors. What did he do to deserve this? He gave sadaqa. Therefore Sadaqaa doesn’t decrease wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were in a certain area giving dawah and alhamdulillaah we always go out calling the people to the Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and remind them of Allaah and the Last Day and righteous deeds and we saw that the mountains were green and the trees were green maasha’Allaah and what a beautiful sight. And they had good agriculture. There must have been a reason because their neighbour’s lands were dusty and barren and their land was green. We saw the reason on the way. There if you walk from a distance to a distance you could have the coolness of water i.e from place to place except that we saw a water cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Because of the water cooler, Allaah sent down rain because of this cooler. If they are generous people, then Allaah is more generous than them. He is generous and loves the generous people and if they are merciful, then Allaah is more merciful than them. Allaah is Merciful and He loves the merciful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sadaqa that they did, Allaah did not lose it for them. On the contrary, He gave them the reward for it in this world and the Hereafter. Therefore Sadaqa is a reason for the increase in provision and it is a door from the doors of sustenance and a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress. And also az-Zakaat, it is a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress and all of what you have heard are doors from the doors of relief from distress –- a door of provision and a reason for provision. Even if some of the people only see the material means. As for these other legislated means then these are not in the minds of most people these days, except those on whom Allaah has mercy on. Eventhough they read the Qur’aan however, without pondering, except whom Allaah has protected from that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) :</span> </strong>If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi &amp; Ahmad) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-tawakkal alallaah – ‘having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds.</strong> </span>That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don’t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is talking about the ‘Lawh al Mahfudh’ — the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘ We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Sheikh reiterates :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don’t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don’t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the ‘Musabbibul Asbaab’ – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that is best without torment, without toil and adverse hardship and that is the way that is best. No more than a means. For example the cure for a disease – a mere means. A man is sick and they say he is tired and sick. Give him some black seed or a little honey or give him some pure milk to drink. Someone has an acidic stomach – so pure milk is good for his stomach. A small thing in a way that is good. And Allaah healed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mere means that they used to do in the past. Someone got sick in the times of the Salaf and their medicine was very simple – maybe with 5 Riyals or 6 Riyals. Not like now where a man may have to sell his house, his property and his car and sell and sell and sell .. so that he can go around and get treatment, go abroad and get treatment and if he had taqwa of Allaah azzawajal he would have got cured with 5 Riyals easily. However, when they opposed look at the punishment? And they didn’t depend upon Allaah, they depended upon the pocket, upon their money, upon his pocket, upon his money, and leaned on himself and didn’t lean on Allaah and in turn Allaah entrusted them to their own selves. My slave did not trust in Me and depended on himself so Allaah entrusted him to himself. So he sells what he owns and he returns sick – the same way he went. Sometimes even more sick and he dies there. And they comes with him dead, wrapped up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be tawakkal alallaah along with carrying out the legislated means. The salaf there used to be from them who used to sell oil and this is present in the biographies of the narrators of Hadeeth – so and so, the son of so and so As-Zayyaath. Meaning he sells zaith – olive oil and such. He spends on himself and his immediate and extended family. So and so, the son of so and so as-Sammaam – he sells saman which is called ghee (a butter material from cattle) and he spends on himself and his family. So and so, the son of so and so al- Assaal – he sells honey. So and so, the son of so and so is al-Hannar – he sells wheat; and they depend on Allaah. Right now you’ll find in most stores and supermarkets – in some of them you will find a thousand type of products as if he wants to put the whole dunya into his pocket.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks)</strong> : Not giving shukr decreases one’s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. ‘<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.</strong></span>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth door is Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) :</strong> <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘And when your Lord proclaimed that if you give thanks, I would increase you and if you deny the blessings then verily My torment is severe. ‘</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where is Ash-Shukr these days as Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says. You have a 100 Riyals, you gave thanks to Allaah without saying ‘what is this, it is just a little bit, this is not enough’. The people they have and they have and you didn’t say this. You leave the speech of the ignorant people. Give thanks to your Lord for a quarter of a Riyal and give thanks to your Lord for the excrement of the feces. If it wasn’t for Allaah it wouldn’t come out. Yes by Allaah the excretion is a very big Ni’maah. If it didn’t come out you would have been befallen by poison and death. Don’t say I don’t have. Has Allaah given me and the people who have and have and have and then they make it hard and then you forget what Allaah gave you of blessings. Don’t you know that giving shukr is a means of increasing your rizq and not giving shukr is a means of decreasing of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sheikh reiterates :</strong> ‘If you give thanks, We will increase you.’  for e.g, If you give thanks to Allaah for a 100/- Allaah increases for you upon it and then it becomes 500/-. If you give thanks to Allaah for 500/- Allaah increases it for you and then it becomes a 1000/-. And the more you give thanks the more Allaah increases you. Allaah does not go back on a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be Shukr and Hamd, giving praise and Sana’a (giving praises of Allaah subhana wa ta’ala) and Eemaan that it is Allaah who provided it for you. Allaah is the One Who provides and He is the One who gives life. He is the One Who gives death and He is the One who does everything (subhana wa ta’ala) and as for the people then they are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘O mankind it is you who stands in need of Allaah but Allaah is rich and free of all needs. If He wished He could destroy you and bring another creation and that is not at all hard upon Allaah</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people all of them are fuqaraahu ilallaah. They are poor people with regards to Allaah so don’t look at their pockets. Look to Allaah. Look to the treasures of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘For Allaah is the treasures of the heavens and the earth</span></strong>. However, the hypocrites do not understand this. The munaafiqun, the hypocrites they always believe and have faith in the material things and as for the unseen things, then they don’t believe. Only in material things 1+1 = 2. Something material, tangible, calculated. Faith in the unseen – this is not present with him. This is present with the believers. For this Allaah said about the Munaafiqeen : They say, ‘Spend not on those who are around Allah’s Messenger until they desert him. They said make it hard for them with regards to charity and donation until they leave from Muhammad and were finished from Islaam and its people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones who said that : don’t spend on the Messenger – the people that are around the Messenger of Allaah until they leave from him. So Allaah said refuting them : &#8220;And for Allaah are the treasures of the Heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites they understand not&#8221;. So beware of being from the Munaafiqeen that don’t understand the Book and the Sunnah and the ones that don’t believe except in material things. They don’t have eemaan in the unseen, untangible things and pursue the Deen of Allaah, and learn the Book and the Sunnah, and act upon it and spread it to the people because Allaah says : We have neglected nothing in the Book, everything is present in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have now 5 ways. So shukr — always make your tongue accustomed to Shukr of Allaah, upon His blessings even if it is a little. Because it is something enormous with Allaah. First of all you are ordered to give Shukr. Then He mentions the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful So you have to thank Allaah</span></strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a saying of the Prophet : ‘So you have to thank Allaah. Whoever doesn’t thank People doesn’t thank Allaah. ‘It is also in the hadith that whoever has helped you : say Jazaak Allaahu khaira. Don’t’ say : what has he given me? Such and such…this is nothing. By Allaah this is a catastrophe for the one that doesn’t accustom himself to giving shukr i.e he doesn’t have except denial of the favours of Allaah and His creation. You should do the contrary, accustom yourself to giving thanks and be from the thankful people. And Allaah (azzawajal) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those before you, if you make shirk then all your deeds will be in vain. And you will certainly be among the losers. Nay, but worship Allaah and be among the grateful. Be from the grateful. Give thanks to Him for everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that if Allaah did not make the sleep for you, what would you do? The rest of the people are asleep and comfortable at night and you don’t have sleep night after night after night. Is it torment or isn’t it? It is ni’maah, the blessing of sleep. How much does it equal?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ni’mah of security, how much does it equal? He mentioned the Surah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[106] Surah Quraish (The Tribe of Quraish)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(1. For the Ilaf of the Quraysh.) </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">(2. Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">(3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">(4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Aman – security or safety is a ni’mah</strong></span>. You must single Allaah in worship. He Allaah subhana wa ta’ala said : You must worship (Allaah) the Lord of this House (the Ka’bah in Makkah), the One who fed you against hunger and made you safe from fear. You must sacrifice for Allaah alone, you don’t make vows except for Allaah, and you don’t swear except by Allaah and you don’t put your trust except in Allaah and he goes on to mentioning a hadeeth about tawakkal :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Allaah put your trust if indeed you are believers. Verily Allaah loves those who trust in Allaah. Then upon Allaah let the people put their trust in. Then upon Allaah let the believers put their trust in.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>The Keys for Receiving Provisions<br />
</b>By Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar bin Salim Bazmool<br />
[From the ‘My Religion taught me’ series]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Receiving Provisions has keys, the most important are five:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First:</strong></span> Being continuous upon the five daily prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the secrets of where paying Zakat is repeatedly connected to establishing the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is – and Allaah knows best – an indication that whoever established the prayer then their provision will increase and they will possess wealth more than they need, so much so that paying Zakat becomes obligatory upon them. This is why the saying of Allaah is repeated [in the Qur’aan]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(اقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>establish the prayer and pay the Zakat</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second:</strong></span> Seeking Forgiveness</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Subhanahu says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>{وَيَا قَوْمِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاء عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَاراً وَيَزِدْكُمْ قُوَّةً إِلَى قُوَّتِكُمْ وَلاَ تَتَوَلَّوْاْ مُجْرِمِينَ }</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn away as Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah)</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; [Hud:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Subhanahu says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[فَقُلْتُ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّاراً{10} يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاء عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَاراً{11} وَيُمْدِدْكُمْ بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ أَنْهَاراً{12} مَّا لَكُمْ لَا تَرْجُونَ لِلَّهِ وَقَاراً].</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">《<strong><span style="color:#000000;">”I said (to them): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord; Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; ‘He will send rain to you in abundance; ‘And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.” What is the matter with you, [that you fear not Allaah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from Allaah or you believe not in His Oneness).</span></strong>》[Nuh:10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third:</strong></span> keeping good relations with relatives</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important and at the forefront is being good to parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas bin Malik <em>-Radhi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa Salam– </em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((مَنْ سَرَّهُ أَنْ يُبْسَطَ لَهُ فِي رِزْقِهِ أَوْ يُنْسَأَ لَهُ فِي أَثَرِهِ فَلْيَصِلْ رَحِمَهُ ))</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Whoever is pleased that his provision is increased or that his life is lengthened then he should keep good relations with his relatives.’</strong> </span>[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth:</strong></span> Taqqwa of Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً{} وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْراً).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">《<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things.</span></strong>》[Talaq: 2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth:</strong></span> Performing Hajj &amp; Umrah a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abdullaah <em>-Radhi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa Salam – </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«تَابِعُوا بَيْنَ الْحَجِّ وَالْعُمْرَةِ؛ فَإِنَّهُمَا يَنْفِيَانِ الْفَقْرَ وَالذُّنُوبَ كَمَا يَنْفِي الْكِيرُ خَبَثَ الْحَدِيدِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَليْسَ لِلْحَجَّةِ الْمَبْرُورَةِ ثَوَابٌ دُونَ الْجَنَّةِ»</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Follow up between Hajj and Umrah since they wipe out poverty and sins, just as the furnace separates the iron slag from gold and silver. There is no reward for a Hajj done correctly except Paradise.’</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Certain people of the Ansar asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he gave them; then they again asked him and he gave them until all what he possessed was exhausted. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> &#8220;Whatever wealth I have, I will not withhold from you. </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“Bless me in what You have given…”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>بَرَكَة</strong></span> (<strong>barakah</strong>) “<strong>blessing</strong>” literally means an abundance of anything good that is continuous. The scholars even trace this word and its meaning back to the word <strong>بِرْكَة</strong> (<strong>birkah</strong>) which means a large amount of water or any wide container or gathering of water that is constantly filled with water. Similarly, the word blessing means a continuously large amount of good. So the meaning of this statement is: <strong><em>Send blessings down upon everything you have given me.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording, “…in what you have given…” is comprehensive including anything Allah has given us of wealth, children, knowledge, and anything else Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) has bestowed upon us. So you ask Allah to put blessings in all of that. If Allah does not put blessings in what he has given you, you would surely be prevented from a great amount of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">How many people have a wealth in abundance, yet it is as if they live in poverty?</span></strong> This is because they gain no real benefit from their wealth; they simply collect it and never benefit from it. This is the result of the blessings being removed from it. Likewise, many people have lots of children and grandchildren, yet their children do not benefit their parents in anything due to their disobedience and ungratefulness. Such people have not been blessed in their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You also find some people to whom Allah has given a great amount of knowledge, yet it is as if he is illiterate.</strong></span> You see no traces of knowledge upon him in his worship, in his character, in his manners, nor in the way he treats others. Rather, his knowledge may even increase him in arrogance and considering himself to be above the rest of Allah’s worshippers, belittling and humiliating them. Such a person does not realize the one who bestowed this knowledge upon him is none other than Allah. You see that he never benefits people with his knowledge, neither with lessons, nor advice, nor with writings. On the contrary, he is exclusively centered only upon himself. This is without doubt a great loss, even though religious knowledge is one of the most blessed things Allah gives to a servant. One reason for this is that when you teach others and spread this knowledge among people, you are rewarded from several different perspectives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you spread this religious knowledge, you are spreading the religion of Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). So you work for the sake of Allah, opening people’s hearts with knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. From the blessings of spreading knowledge and teaching it is that by doing so, there is the preservation and protection of Allah’s legislation (religious laws). If it weren’t for the passing on of knowledge, the legislation would not have been preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Also from the blessings of spreading knowledge is that when you teach others, you do them a great deal of good. You give them insight into the religion of Allah. And when that person then worships Allah with knowledge and insight, you are rewarded with similar rewards he is given because it was you who directed him towards a particular good deed, and the one who directs another to do something good is just like the one who actually does it. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Also, by spreading and teaching religious knowledge, one’s own knowledge increases. It is known that anyone who teaches a particular knowledge to people, his knowledge in that subject will increase. This is because in teaching, one is recalling what he previously learned and memorized as well as learning new things that he must prepare. To this meaning, there is a famous (Arabic) proverb regarding wealth, “It increases by spending it often, and it decreases if held in a tight fist.” Similarly, if knowledge is withheld and not taught, it will eventually decrease.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] A proof of this is the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim (no. 1893), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2671), Abū Dāwūd (no. 5129), and by Aḥmad in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَنْ دَلَّ عَلَى خَيْرٍ فَلَهُ مِثْلُ أَجْرِ فَاعِلِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>Whoever directs someone to do something good, he will have a reward like the one who actually did it.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] <strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her own money without the permission of her husband? And what if she knows prior to that, that her husband does not agree with her disposing of her money, even if it is for charity? And also, what about giving away her jewelry which she bought with her own money, without his permission. What is the ruling concerning this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The ruling on this matter is clear from the hadeeth of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her wealth except with the permission of her husband.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a hasan saheeh hadeeth, hasan by itself and saheeh based on its various routes of narration. And as for all the reports that it is thought present a contradiction to this hadeeth, then it is not correct to rely on that or claim that they contradict the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth in which the women gave their rings and earrings away in charity, as is reported in the Saheeh, then this has been responded to from many different angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is that it was probable that these charitable donations were given with the permission form the husbands of these women. And it is also possible that this event occurred before this ruling that occurs in the hadeeth became firmly established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So due to this, we advise every Muslim woman that adheres to acting on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah to not give away from her wealth without the permission of her husband. This is because it will be a cause and a reason for the occurrence of disputes between the couple, and the end result of that will be very bad.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in the case where a husband is mean and oppressive to his wife (by not granting her permission), she can take her case to the legal jurisdiction. And this is especially the case since today, the legal jurisdictions are in favor of the women. And in a more particular example, in cases like these, all of the judges are in agreement that the woman may freely dispose of her money without the permission of her husband. So if the matter is taken up to the court and the judge rules that this action was a violation on the part of the husband to his wife and he rules that she can give away her money, (she may do so). But if her husband objects and holds that by her doing so, she will be squandering money, at that point the judge can prevent her because, even though he bases it on the rule that it is allowed for her to spend from her wealth, he can not permit her to give away in charity that which is considered excessiveness and a squandering of money. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s craving after status is even more destructive than his craving after wealth. Seeking after worldly status, position, leadership and domination causes more harm to a person that his seeking after wealth – it is more damaging and harder to avoid since even wealth is expended in seeking after leadership and status. Craving after status is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Type of Craving for Status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is seeking status through authority, leadership, and wealth and this is very dangerous – since it will usually prevent a person from the good of the Hereafter and nobility and honour in the next life, Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“That home of the Hereafter We shall assign to those who seek neither haughtiness nor any corruption on earth. The good end is for the pious.”</span></em> [Al-Qasas (28):83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is rare that a person seeks after position in this world by seeking authority and is guided to and granted what is good for him. Rather he is entrusted to his own self, just as the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, radiyallaahu `anhu, “O `Abdur-Rahmaan! Do not ask for authority since if you are given it due to requesting it then you are abandoned to it, but if you are given it without requesting it then you will be aided in it.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf said, “ No one seeks after authority and then behaves justly in it.” Yazeed ibn `Abdillaah ibn Mawhib was a just judge and one of the righteous people and he used to say, “Whoever loves wealth and status and fears adversity will not behave with justice.” There occurs in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Aboo Hurairah, radiyAllaahu`anhu, from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, “You will be keen to attain authority and it will be a source of regret on the Day of Resurrection. So what an excellent wet-nurse it is and what an evil weaner.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-Bukhaaree) also reports from Aboo Moosa al-Ash`aree, radiyAllaahu `anhu, that two men said to the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Appoint us to some position of authority.’ So he said, ‘We do not appoint to authority in this affair of ours one who requests it, nor one who is keen to have it.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that craving after status and position inevitably causes great harm before its attainment due to the striving necessary to attain it, and also afterwards due to the person’s strong desire to hold onto it which produces injustice, haughtiness and other evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Aboo Bakr al-Aajurree</strong>, who was one of the wise scholars and teachers at the start of the fourth century, wrote at treatise about the manners and the sentiments of the scholars and it is one of the best works on this topic. One who studies it will know from it the way of the scholars of the Salaf, and will know the innovated ways contrary to their way. So he describes the evil scholar at length, from this description is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘He has become infatuated with love of this world, and with praise, honour and position with the people of this world. He uses knowledge as an adornment just as a beautiful woman adorns herself with jewellery for this world, but he does not adorn his knowledge with action upon it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-29224"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then mentions a lengthy speech and then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“So these characteristics and their like predominate in the heart of one who does not benefit from knowledge, so whilst he carries these attributes his soul will come to have love of status and position – so that he loves to sit with kings and the sons of this world. The he loves to share in their opulent lifestyle, sharing their lavish attire, their comfortable transport, servants, fine clothing, delicate bedding and delicious food. He will love that people throng to his door, that his saying is listened to, and that he is obeyed – and he can only attain the latter by becoming a judge (qaadee) – so he seeks to become one. Then he is unable to attain it except at the expense of his Religion, so he debases himself to the rulers and their helpers, serving them himself and giving them his wealth as a tribute. He remains silent when he sees their evil actions after entering their palaces and homes. Then on top of this he may praise their evil actions and declare them good due to some false interpretation in order to raise his position with them. So when he has accustomed himself to doing this over a long period of time and falsehood has taken root in him – then they appoint him to the position of judge (qaadee) and in so doing slaughter him without a knife.”</em> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they have bestowed such a favour upon him that he is obliged and has to show his gratitude to them – so he takes great pains to make sure that he does not anger them and cause them to remove him from his position. But he has no concern about whether he angers his Lord, the Most High, so he misappropriates the wealth of orphans, widows, the poor and the needy, and wealth bequested as waaf (religious endowment) for those fighting Jihaad and the nobles of Makkah and al-Madeenah, and wealth which is supposed to be of benefit to all the Muslims – but instead he uses it to satisfy his clerk, chamberlain and servant. So he eats that which is haraam and feeds with that which is haraam and increases that which is a proof against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So woe to the one whose knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge from and ordered us to seek refuge from. This is the knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) mentioned, saying, <span style="color:#008000;">“Those amongst the people receiving the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection is the scholar who is not given benefit through his knowledge by Allaah.”</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say, <span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma innee a’oodhubika minal arba’i, min `ilmin laa yanfa`u, wa min qalbin laa yakhsha`u, wa min nafsin laa tashba`u, wa min du`aa in laa yusma`u) “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit; from a heart which does not fear; from a soul which is never satisfied; and from a supplication which is not heard.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma inne as`aluka `ilman naafi`an, wa a`oodhubika min `ilman laa yanfa`u)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah I ask You for beneficial knowledge, and I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.”</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was said by Imaam Aboo Bakr al-Aajuree, rahimahullaahu ta`aala who lived at the end of the fourth century [17] and corruption increased and multiplied greatly since his time – and there is no might and no strength except by Allaah’s will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the subtle afflictions caused by love of status is seeking after and aspiring positions of authority – this is something whose reality is hidden and obscure. It is not understood except by those who have knowledge of Allaah, those who love Him and who are at enmity with those ignorant one’s from His creation who desire to compete with Him with regard to His Lordship and Divinity and right to worship, despite their despicability and the contemptible position they have before Allaah and in the eyes of His chosen servants who have knowledge of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as <strong>al-Hasan (al-Basree)</strong>, rahimahullaah, said about them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Even if the hooves of mules clatter for them and riding beasts strut for them, yet still the humiliation of sin rests upon their necks. Allaah has refused except that He will humiliate those who are disobedient to Him.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that love of status attained by having one’s orders and prohibitions obeyed and enacted, and by merely the attainment of a position above the people and to have importance over them, and that it be seen that the people are in need of him and seek their needs from him – then the soul of this person is seeking to compete with Allaah in His Lordship and His Divinity and right to worship. Some such people may even seek to put the people into such a condition of need that they are compelled to request their needs from them, and to display their poverty before them and their need of them. Then he is inflated with pride and self-importance because of that, whereas this befits none except Allaah alone. He who has no partner. Allaah, the Most High, Says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health with calamities so that they might believe with humility.”</span></em> [Al-An`aam (6):42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also occurs in some narrations that Allaah, the Most High, sends adversity upon His servant in order to hear him call upon him with full humility. There also occurs in the narrations that when the servant whom Allaah loves supplicates to Allaah, the Most High, then He, the Most High, says, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Jibreel! Do not hasten to carry out his need, for I love that I should hear him calling with full humility.”</span></em>[18] So these matters are worse and more dangerous than mere injustice and are more sinister, and they are a part of shirk – and shirk is the greatest injustice and transgression with Allaah. It is reported in the Saheeh from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah, the Most High, says, ‘Pride is my cloak and majesty is my lower-garment so whoever vies with Me regarding them I will punish him.’”</span></em> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also happened that one of the people of the past was a judge and he saw in a dream that someone was saying to him, “You are a judge and Allaah is a Judge.” So he awoke in a distressed state and removed himself from the position of a judge and abandoned it. Some of the pious judges used to prevent the people from calling them ‘Judge of judges’ (Qaadiyyul-Qudaat) since this name resembles the name ‘King of kings’ which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) censured that one should use as a title, and ‘Judge of judges’ is like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also related to this is the one having status and authority loves that he is praised and commended for his actions and seeks that from the people. Those who do not comply with this suffer as a result. It may even be that his actions are actually more deserving of blame than of praise, or he manifests something that is apparently good – and loves to be praised for it, yet in reality he is intending something evil and is happy that he is able to deceive the people and fool them about it. This falls under the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done, think not that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.”</span></em> [Aal-‘Imraan (3):188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this Aayah was sent down regarding those who have these attributes, and this attribute (i.e. seeking praise from the creation and loving it and punishing those who do not give it) is not fitting except for Allaah, alone, having no partner. This is why the rightly guided leaders used to forbid people to praise them for their actions and any good which if they did, and they would order that rather praise be given to Allaah alone, having no partner – since all blessings are from Him.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Umar ibn Abdul &#8211; `Azeez</strong>, rahimahullaah, was very particular about this and he once wrote a letter to be read out to the people performing Hajj. It contained an order that they should be treated well and that oppression of them should stop, and in it there occurred, “And do not praise anyone for this except Allaah, since if He abandoned me to my own desiresI would be just like the others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a also a well-known narration about what occurred with him concerning the woman who requested from him that he should provide an allowance for her orphaned daughters. She had four daughters and he gave an allowance to two of them and she praised Allaah. Then he gave an allowance to the third so she thanked him, so he said, “We were giving an allowance to them as long as you were giving praise to the One to whom it is due, but now order this third one to share her allowance with the fourth,” or as he said, radiyAllaahu `anhu. He wanted to make it known that the position of leadership is only established so that Allaah’s commands are carried out, and so that the servants can be commanded to obey Allaah, the Most High, and forbidden from those things which Allaah has prohibited, and so that the leader acts with sincerity towards Allaah’s servants by calling them to Allaah. His intention is that the Deen should in its entirety be for Allaah, and that honour be for Allaah. Along with this he is fearful that he is himself falling short with regard to the rights of Allaah, the Most High. So as for those who love Allaah, then the limit of their desire with regard to the creation is that they should also love Allaah, obey Him and single Him out with all worship and recognise His Divinity alone. (Then how about one who seeks to vie with Him in this?!) Rather this type of person does not desire any reward or any thanks from the creation, but hopes for reward for his actions from Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“It is not (possible) for any human being to whom Allaah has given al-Hukma (knowledge and understanding of the laws of Religion etc.) and Prophethood to say to the people: “Be my worshippers rather than Allaah’s.’ On the contrary (he would say): ‘Be you rabbaaniyyoon (learned men of Religion, who practice what they know and also preach to others) because you teach the Book, and you study it.’ Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods). Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allaah’s Will?”</span></em> [Aal-`Imraan (3):79-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the Messiah, the son of Maryam. Indeed I am only a slave. So say the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</span></em>” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) also used to criticise anyone who did not keep to this manner of address with regard to him, just as he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and Muhammad has willed, ` but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed, then what Muhammad has willed.’”</span> </em>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also replied to a person who said, “Whatever Allah and yourself have willed,” by saying, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you made me a rival for Allaah! Rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah alone has willed.’”</span></em> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this khulafaa who have succeeded the Prophets, and their followers – the just rulers and their successors, and their judges, never used to call to glorification of themselves but rather to the glorification of Allaah alone and that He is to be singled out with worship and divinity. From them were those who did not wish for leadership at all except as an aid to calling to Allaah alone. Some of the righteous people who accepted the position of judge said, “Indeed I accepted this in order to use it to help me in ordering the good and forbidding the evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Messengers and their followers would persevere in the face of injury and harm which they suffered whilst calling to Allaah, and in carrying out Allaah’s commands they were put into the severest hardship by the people and yet they bore it with patience. Indeed being pleased with that, since one who has love may find pleasure in any harm he meets whilst seeking to please the one whom he loves. Just as `Abdul-Maalik ibn `Umar ibn `Abdul-Azeez used to say to his father when he was the khaleefah and he had keen desire that the truth and justice be established, “O father I would have loved that we had been forced into boiling cooking pots for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another righteous person said, “I would have loved that my flesh were cut away with scissors if it meant that all the creation would obey Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.” This saying of his was related to a certain wise person, so he said, “If what he was speaking of was sincere concern for the creation, otherwise I do not know.” Then he fainted. The meaning of this is that the one who said this had true and sincere concern  for the creation and pity for them, fearing Allaah’s punishment for them, so he would have loved that they could have been saved from Allaah’s punishment at the expense of his ownself. It could also be that he was considering the Majesty and Greatness of Allaah and the glorification, honour, obedience and love due to Him, so he wished that the creation would fulfil that even if it meant the most severe harm to himself. This is the state of mind of the distinguished ones who love Allaah and have knowledge of Him and keep Him in mind. This is what caused the man to faint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, also described in His Book those who love Him as being those who fight Jihaad in His cause and do not fear the blame of those who seek to blame.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning this someone said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I find that being blamed whilst pursuing what you desire is delightful, For having love for your remembrance let those who wish  to blame me do so.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Ahmad and al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/194/no.260)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.262) and others. Note: His saying, “It will be a source of regret.” Means one who does not behave correctly having attained it – and the proof of this is what Muslim reports from Aboo Dharr who said, ‘I said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Will you not appoint me to some position?” He said, “You are weak and it is a trust and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for one who fulfils its obligations and carries out the duties required from him.” (Saheeh Muslim, transl.3/1015/4491). An-Nawawee said, “This is a great reason to avoid positions of authority especially those who are weak – and this refers to those who are not suitable and those who do not act justly in the position – then he will regret his negligence when he is humiliated on the Day of Resurrection. However one who is suitable for the position and behaves justly in it – then there is a great reward as shown in a number of reports. However entering into it carries a great danger therefore the great scholars avoided it. His saying, “What a good wet-nurse” (i.e. the one who feeds the baby at breast) meaning in this world, and “What an evil weaner” meaning after death – since he will be taken to account for it. So he is like one who is weaned away from breast milk before he can manage without it – so this causes his destruction. And it is said, “What a good wet nurse” due to the status, wealth, authority, attainment of physical and imagined enjoyment which it produces whilst one has it, but “What an evil weaner”, meaning when one is removed from it by death or other causes – due to the even consequences one faces in the Hereafter.” (Abridged and edited from Fathul-Baaree of Ibn Hajar (13/125-126)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.263) and Muslim (transl. 3/1014/no.4489)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Alluding to the saying of the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), “He who is appointed as a judge has been killed without a knife.” Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1013/no.3564) and at- Tirmidhee who declared it hasan. I say: its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Reported by Ibn `Abdul-Barr in Jaami` Bayaanil-`Ilm (1/162) and al-Aajuree (pp.93-94) and at- Tabaraanee in as-Sagheer (1/1831) and others and its chain of narration is very weak since it contains `Uthmaan ibn Miqsam al-Burree who was accused of lying and fabrication. It is however reported as being the saying of Abud-Dardaa only, with an authentic chain of narration. It is reported by ad- Daarimee (1/82) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.1/p.401/no.1543) and others, all with the wording, “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from four: from knowledge which does not benefit…” The hadeeth was declared to be saheeh by al-Haakim and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and it has supports from a number of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported with this wording by al-Aajuree (p.134) and Ibn Hibbaan (no.2426). It also reported by Ibn Maajah (no.3843) and Ibn `Abdul-Barr (1/162) with the wording, “Ask Allaah for beneficial knowledge and seek Allaah’s refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.” Its chain of narration is hasan (good) and there is similar narration from Umm Salamah reported by Ibn Majah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Al-Aajurree, rahimahullaah, died in the year 360H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] The meaning of this is reported in the hadeeth qudsee which is mentioned by Shaikh Muhammad al- Madanee in his book al-Ittihaafaatus-Sunniyyah fil-Ahaadeethil-Qudsiyyah (no.438) – and he mentioned that Ibn `Asaakir reported it with a chain of narration containing Ishaaq ibn `Abdillaah ibn Abee Farwa who is abandoned as a narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1141/no.4079) and Ibn Maajah from the hadeeth of Ibn Maajah, except that their wording ends, “…So whoever vies with Me regarding any of them…” and in a wording, “…. Anything from them, I will fling him into Hell-Fire.” And in a wording, “…the Fire.” Its chain of narration is saheeh. Muslim (transl. 4/1381/no.6349) also reports one version of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.vol.4, p.435, no.654) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Reported by ad-Daarimee (2/295) with this wording and its chain of narration is saheeh. It is also reported with the wording, “Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah and so and so have willed.’ but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and then what so and so has willed.’” It is reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.3, p.1386, no.4962) and others and its chain of narration is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree in al-Aadabul-Mufrad (no.783) and others, and its chain of narration is hasan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<p><strong>When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</span> </em>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></span>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> “So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em> “So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, commerce is of two types – <strong>the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter)</strong>. The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.”</span></em><strong><em> </em></strong>[Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.”</strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></span>[Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong></span>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).”</span> </em>[Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.”</strong></span> So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is it poverty that you fear?! I swear by Him in whose Hand is my life; the world will be excessively poured upon you, to the extent that one of your hearts will not excessively deviate except due to the <em>Dunyaa</em>. Verily I swear by Allaah that I indeed left you upon clarity, its night and day are equal.’</p>

Then the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> took that morsel of food and spat it out and said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">545 – On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–Radhiallaahu anhu-</em>  who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘For one of you to gather wood in a bundle on his back is better for him than asking/begging from anyone, they either give it to him or withhold it from him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 356<br />
Prohibition of Squandering Wealth</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1781.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, Allah likes three things for you and disapproves three things for you. He likes that you should worship Him Alone, not to associate anything with Him (in worship) and to hold fast to the Rope of Allah and not to be divided among yourselves; and He disapproves for you irrelevant talk, persistent questioning and the squandering of the wealth.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1782.</b> Warrad, the scribe of Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah dictated a letter to me addressed to Mu`awiyah  (May Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of each obligatory Salat (prescribed prayer): &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">La ilaha illallahu, wahadahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai&#8217;in Qadir. Allahumma la mani`a lima a`taita, wa la mu`tiya lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi mink-al-jaddu. (There is no true god except Allah, the One, Who has no partner. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Able to do everything. O Allah! Nobody can withhold what You give; and nobody can give what You withhold; and the high status of a person is of no avail against Your Will)</span>.&#8221; He also wrote to him that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to forbid irrelevant talk, wasteful expenditure, persistent questioning, disobedience of parents (especially mothers), infanticide of daughters by burying them alive, depriving others of their rights and acquisition of property wrongfully.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Those who eat Ar-Riba (the usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitan (Satan) leading him to insanity.

So whosoever receives an admonition from his Rubb and stops eating Ar-Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Ar-Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire &#8211; they will abide therein. Allah will destroy Ar-Riba and will give increase for Sadaqat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allah likes not the disbelievers, sinners. Truly, those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-As-Salat), and give Zakat, they will have their reward with their Rubb. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ar-Riba (from now onward)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (2:275-279)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahadith on the subject are many, including Hadith No. 1615.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1615.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed the one who accepts Ar-Riba (the usury) and the one who pays it.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>

About Speedy Repayment of the Debts of a Deceased Person and Preparation of<br />
Burial</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>943.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The soul of the deceased believer remains pending on account of the debt till it (the debt) is repayed.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>944.</b> Hussain bin Wahwah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Talhah bin Al-Bara&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) fell ill, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to visit him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, I think that Talhah is about to die. So inform me when he is dead and make haste (in burying him). Indeed, it is improper for the corpse of a Muslim to be kept lying unburied among his family members.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

Chapter 64 : Excellence of a Grateful Rich Man</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness).&#8221;</span> (92:5-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;And Al-Muttaqun (the pious and righteous) will be far removed from it (Hell). He who spends his wealth for increase in self-purification. And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back. Except to seek the Countenance of his Rubb, the Most High. He surely, will be pleased (when he will enter Jannah).&#8221;</span> (92:17-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;If you disclose your Sadaqat (alms-giving), it is well; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you. (Allah) will expiate you some of your sins. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.&#8221;</span> (2:271)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness &#8211; here it means Allah&#8217;s reward, i.e., Jannah), unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love; and whatever of good you spend, Allah knows it well.&#8221;</span> (3:92)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>571.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Envy is permitted only in two cases: A man whom Alah gives wealth, and he disposes of it rightfully, and a man to whom Allah gives knowledge which he applies and teaches it.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>572.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Envy is justified in regard to two types of persons only: a man whom Allah has given knowledge of the Qur&#8217;an, and so he recites it during the night and during the day; and a man whom Allah has given wealth and so he spends from it during the night and during the day.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>573.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Some of the poor Emigrants came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said to him, &#8220;The wealthy have obtained all high ranks and everlasting bliss.&#8221; He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How is that?</span>&#8221; They replied: &#8220;They offer Salat as we do, and observe Saum (fasting) as we do, but they give in Sadaqah (charity) and we do not, and they emancipate slaves and we cannot.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Shall I not teach you something whereby you will catch up with those who have preceded you and will get ahead of those who follow you, and no one will surpass you unless he does the same as you do?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Surely, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Say: Subhan Allah, and Allahu Akbar, and praise Him (by saying Al-hamdu lillah) thirty-three times at the end of every Salat.&#8221;</span> They returned to him and said: &#8220;Our brothers, the possessors of wealth, having heard what we are doing, have started doing the same.&#8221; Messenger of Allah  (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;This is Grace of Allah which He gives to whom He wishes.&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;But he who is greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient. And belies Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path for evil. And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)?&#8221;</span> (92:8-11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, then they are the successful ones.&#8221;</span> (64:16)</p>

Chapter 60 : Excellence of Generosity and Spending in a Good cause with Reliance on Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah&#8217;s Cause), He will replace it.&#8221;</span> (34:39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves, when you spend not except seeking Allah&#8217;s Countenance. And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.&#8221;</span> (2:272)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well.&#8221;</span> (2:273)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>544.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Envy is permitted only in two cases: A man whom Allah gives wealth, and he disposes of it rightfully, and a man to whom Allah gives knowledge which he applies and teaches it.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>545.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who of you loves the wealth of his heir more than his own wealth?&#8221;</span> The Companions said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! There is none of us but loves his own wealth more.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">His wealth is that which he has sent forward, but that which he retains belongs to his heir.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>546.</b> `Adi bin Hatim (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Protect yourself from Hell-fire even by giving a piece of date as charity.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>547.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never said `no&#8217; to anyone who asked him for anything.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>548.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Everyday two angels descend and one of them says, `O Allah! Compensate (more) to the person who gives (in charity)&#8217;; while the other one says, `O Allah! Destroy the one who withholds (charity, etc)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari ].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>549.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, says, `Spend, O son of Adam, you will also be spent upon.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>550.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;Which act in Islam is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;To feed (the poor and the needy) and to greet those whom you know and those you do not know.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>551</b>. `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are forty kinds of virtue, the highest of which is to gift a (milch) she goat. He who practises any of these virtues, expecting its reward (from Allah) and believing on the verity of the promise made for it, will enter Jannah.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>552.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O son of Adam, if you spend the surplus, it will be better for you; and if you retain it, it will be bad for you. You will not be reprimanded for keeping what is enough for your need. Begin with those who are your dependents, and the upper hand (i.e., the one that spends in the way of Allah) is better than the lower hand (i.e., the one that receives charity.)&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>553.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked a thing by one who is about to accept Islam but he would give it. A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he gave him a herd of sheep scattered between two mountains. When he returned to his people, he said to them:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O my people! Embrace Islam because Muhammad gives like one who has no fear of poverty.</span>&#8221; Some people would embrace Islam only for worldly gains, but soon Islam becomes dearer to them than the world with all what it contains.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>554.</b> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) distributed some wealth and I said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Do you not think that there are other people who are more deserving than these whom you gave.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They had, in fact, left no alternative for me except either they should beg of me importunately or they would regard me as a miser; but I am not a miser.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>555.</b> Jubair bin Mut`im (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: While I was walking with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on his return from the battle of Hunain, a few bedouins caught hold of him and began to demand their shares. They forced him to a tree and someone snatched away his cloak (which got entangled in that thorny tree). The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give my cloak back to me. Were I to have camels equal to the number of these trees, I would have distributed them all among you, and you would not have found me a miser, or a liar, or a coward.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>556.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Wealth is not diminished by giving (in charity). Allah augments the honour of one who forgives; and one who displays humbleness towards another seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah exalts him in ranks.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>557.</b> Abu Kabshah `Amr bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I swear by Allah for three (qualities) which I am going to tell you about. Remember them well:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#0000ff;">1) The wealth of a man will not diminish by Sadaqah (charity).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(2) Allah augments the honour of a man who endures an oppression patiently.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(3) He who opens a gate of begging, Allah opens a gate of poverty (or he said a word similar to it).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) also said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Remember well what I am going to tell you: The world is for four kinds of people. (1) One upon whom Allah has bestowed wealth and knowledge and so he fears his Rubb in respect to them, joins the ties of blood relationship and acknowledges the Rights of Allah on him (and fulfills them); this type will have the best position (in Jannah). (2) One upon whom Allah has conferred knowledge but no wealth, and he is sincere in his intention and says: `Had I possessed wealth, I would have acted like so-and-so.&#8217; If that is his intention, his reward is the same as that of the other. (3) One whom Allah has given wealth but no knowledge and he squanders his wealth ignorantly, does not fear Allah in respect to it, does not discharge the obligations of kinship and does not acknowledge the Rights of Allah. Such a person will be in the worst position (in the Hereafter). (4) One upon whom Allah has bestowed neither wealth nor knowledge and he says: `Had I possessed wealth, I would have acted like so-and-so (i.e., he would squander his wealth).&#8217; If this is his intention, both will have equal sin.&#8221;  </span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>558.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had slaughtered a sheep and distributed major portions of its meat. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is there anything left?</span>&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Nothing, except the shoulder.&#8221; Thereupon he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;All of it is left except its shoulder.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>559.</b> Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not hoard; otherwise, Allah will withhold from you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>560.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The case of a miserly man and a generous man who gives in charity is similar to that of two persons who are clad in armour from their breasts up to their collar bones. When the generous man gives in charity, his armour expands so much as to cover his fingertips and toes. When the miser intends to spend something the armour contracts and every ring of it sticks to the place where it is (sinks into his flesh). He tries to loosen it but it does not expand.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>561.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who gives in charity the value of a date which he legally earned, and Allah accepts only that which is pure, Allah accepts it with His Right Hand and fosters it for him, as one of you fosters his mare, until it becomes like a mountain.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>562.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;While a man was walking through a barren land, he heard a voice coming out of a cloud saying: `Irrigate the garden of so-and-so.&#8217; Thereupon the cloud drifted in a certain direction and discharged its water over a rocky plain. The streamlets flowed into a channel. This man followed the channel until it reached a garden and he saw the owner of the garden standing in its center, working with his spade spreading the water (changing the course of the water). He asked him: &#8220;O slave of Allah, what is your name?&#8221; He told his name, which was the same that he heard from the cloud. The owner of the garden then asked him: &#8220;O slave of Allah, why did you ask my name?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I heard a voice from a cloud which poured down this water saying: `Irrigate the garden of so-and-so.&#8217; I would like to know what do you do with it.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Now that you asked me, I will tell you. I estimate the produce of the garden and distribute one-third of it in charity, I spend one-third on myself and my family and invest one-third back into the garden.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 55<br />
Excellence of Leading an Ascetic Life, and Virtues of Simple Life</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the water (rain) which We send down from the sky; so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat: until when the earth is clad in its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all the powers of disposal over it, Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus, do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for the people who reflect.&#8221;</b></span><b> (10:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But (later) it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. And Allah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that last, are better with your Rubb for rewards and better in respect of hope.&#8221;</b></span><b> (18:45,46)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (It is) as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the disbelievers-evildoers), and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers-gooddoers). And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment&#8221;.</b></span><b> (57:20).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent return (Jannah with flowing rivers) with Him.&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:14).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! Verily, the Promise of Allah is true. So let not this present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver (Satan) deceive you about Allah.&#8221;</b></span><b> (35:5).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;The mutual rivalry (for piling up of worldly things) diverts you. Until you visit the graves (i.e., till you die). Nay! You shall come to know! Again nay! You shall come to know! Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have been occupied yourselves in worldly things)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (102:1-5).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And this life of the world is only amusement and play! Verily, the home of the Hereafter is the real life if they but knew&#8221;.</b></span><b>  (29:64).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>457.</b> `Amr bin `Auf Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) to Bahrain to collect (Jizyah). So he returned from Bahrain with wealth. The Ansar got news of it and joined with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the Fajr prayer. When the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concluded the prayer, they stood in his way. When he saw them, he smiled and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I think you have heard about the arrival of Abu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">Ubaidah with something from Bahrain&#8221;.</span> They said, &#8220;Yes! O Messenger of Allah!&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Rejoice and hope for that which will please you. By Allah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but I fear that this world will be opened up with its wealth for you as it was opened to those before you; and you vie with one another over it as they did and eventually it will ruin you as it ruined them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>458.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sat on the pulpit and we sat around him. He said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What I am concerned most is the flourishment and the beauty of this world will be available to you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>459.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The world is sweet and green (alluring); and verily, Allah is making you to succeed each other, generations after generations in it in order to see how you act. So beware of this world  and beware of women&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>460.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, there is no true life but the life of the Hereafter&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>461.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three (things) follow a dead person: Members of his family, his property and his deeds. Two of them return; and one remains with him. The people and his wealth return; his deeds remain with him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>462.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Among the inmates of Hell, a person who had led the most luxurious life in this world will be brought up on the Day of Resurrection and dipped in the Fire and will be asked: `O son of Adam! Did you ever experience any comfort? Did you happen to get any luxury?&#8217; He will reply: `By Allah, no, my Rubb.&#8217; And then one of the people of Jannah who had experienced extreme misery in the life of this world will be dipped in Jannah. Then he will be asked: `O son of Adam! Did you ever experience any misery? Did you ever encounter difficulty?&#8217; He will say: &#8220;By Allah, no my Rubb, I neither experienced misery nor passed through hardship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>463.</b> Al-Mustaurad bin Shaddad (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;This world (i.e., its pleasures and duration) in comparison with the Hereafter is (similar to the amount of water) one gets when he puts his finger in the sea. Let him then see what it returns with&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>464.</b> Jabir bin `Abdullah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was passing through the bazaar with his Companions on his both sides, when he saw a dead skinny lamb. He held its ear and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who of you would like to have it for a dirham&#8221;.</span> They replied, &#8220;We do not like to get it for nothing, and what shall we do with it?&#8221;. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Would you like to have it for nothing?&#8221;.</span> They replied, &#8220;Had it been alive, it would have been defective because it is skinny; but when dead it is of no use&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Truly, the world is more contemptible to Allah than this (the dead lamb) is to you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>465.</b> Abu Dharr (May allah be pleased with him) reported: I was walking with the Prophet on the stony ground in Al-Madinah in the afternoon when Uhud Mount came into sight. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Abu Dharr!&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, here I am responding to you&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If I had as much gold as the weight of Uhud, it would not please me to have a single dinar out of it with me after the passage of three days, but I would hold back something for the repayment of a debt. I would distribute it among the slaves of Allah like this and like this and like this.&#8221;</span> And he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. We then walked a little further and he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The rich would be poor on the Day of  Resurrection, except he who spent like this and like this and like this,&#8221;. and he pointed as he did the first time. &#8220;But such persons are few&#8221;.</span> Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Stay where you are till I come back to you&#8221;.</span> He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) walked ahead a little further in the darkness of the night and disappeared from my sight. I heard a loud voice. I said (to myself): &#8220;The Messenger of Allah might have met (mishap or an enemy)&#8221;.<span style="color:#008000;"> I</span> wished I could go after him but I remembered his commanding me to stay till he came back<span style="color:#008000;">.</span> So I waited for him; and when he came, I made mention of what I had heard. He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you hear it?&#8221;</span>. I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It was Jibril (Gabriel), who came to me and said: `He who dies among your Ummah without having associated anything with Allah (in worship) will enter Jannah.&#8217; I said: `Even if he committed illicit sexual intercourse or steals?&#8217; He (Jibril) said: `Even if he has committed illicit sexual intercourse or steals&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>466.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If I had gold equal to Mount Uhud (in weight), it would not please me to pass three nights and I have a thing of it left with me, except what I retain for repayment of a debt&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>467.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Look at those who are inferior to you and do not look at those who are superior to you, for this will keep you from belittling Allah&#8217;s Favour to you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wording in Sahih Muslim. The narration in Al-Bukhari is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you looks at someone who is superior to him in property and appearance, he should look at someone who is inferior to him&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>468.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with ihm) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May he be miserable, the worshipper of the dinar and dirham, and the worshipper of the striped silk cloak. If he is given anything, he is satisfied; but if not, he is unsatisfied&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>469.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw seventy of the people of the Suffah and none of them had a cloak. They had either a lower garment or a blanket which they suspended from their necks. Some (cloaks) reached halfway down to the legs and some to the ankles; and the man would manage to keep it in his hand to avoid exposing his private parts.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>470.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The world is the believer&#8217;s prison and the infidel&#8217;s Jannah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>471.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took hold of my shoulders and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be in the world like a stranger or a wayfarer&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) used to say:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;When you survive till the evening, do not expect to live until the morning; and when you survive until the morning, do not expect to live until the evening; (do good deeds) when you are in good health before you fall sick, and (do good deeds) as long as you are alive before death strikes&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>472.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, guide me to such an action which, if I do Allah will love me and the people will also love me.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Have no desire for this world, Allah will love you; and have no desire for what people possess, and the people will love you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Ibn Majah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>473.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) spoke at length regarding the worldly prosperity that people had achieved and said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I saw that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would pass his days in hunger and could not get even degraded dates to fill his stomach&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>474.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) died when my house was void of any edible thing except for a small quantity of barley I had on a shelf and from which I kept eating it for a long time. Then when I measured what was left of it, it soon finished.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>475.</b> `Amr bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) the brother of Juwairiyah (May Allah be pleased with her), the Mother of believers) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> (When he died) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) left neither a dinar nor a dirham nor a male slave nor a female slave, nor anything else except his white riding mule, his weapons and his land which he had given in charity to wayfarers.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>476.</b> Al-Khabbab bin Al-Aratt (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> We emigrated with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) seeking the pleasure of Allah and expecting our reward from Him. Some of us died without enjoying anything of it. Among them was Mus`ab bin `Umair (May Allah be pleased with him), who was killed in the battle of Uhud, leaving only a small coloured sheet of wool (which we used as his shroud). When we covered his head with it, his feet were exposed, and when we covered his feet with it, his head was uncovered. So the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told us to cover his head and to put some Idhkhir (i.e., fragrant grass) over his feet. Others among us enjoy prosperity.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>477.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Were this world worth a wing of mosquito, He would not have given a drink of water to an infidel.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>478.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily! The world is accursed and what it contains is accursed, except remembrance of Allah and those who associate themselves with Allah; and a learned man, and a learning person.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>479.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not crave for property lest you should be absorbed in the desire of worldly life.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>480.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were repairing our thatchy hut when Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by and asked us,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span> We said, &#8220;The thatch had gone weak and we are repairing it.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I see the sure thing (death) approaching sooner than this.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>481.</b> Ka`b bin `Iyad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, there is a Fitnah (trial) for every nation and the trial for my nation (or Ummah) is wealth.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>482.</b> `Uthman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is no right for the son of adam except in these (four) things: A house to live in, a cloth to cover therewith his private parts, bread and water.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>483.</b>  `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while he was reciting (Surat At-Takathur 102):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;The mutual rivalry (for hoarding worldly things) preoccupy you. Until you visit the graves (i.e., till you die). Nay! You shall come to know! Again nay! You shall come to know! Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of hoarding, you would not have been occupied in worldly things). Verily, you shall see the blazing Fire (Hell)! And again, you shall see it with certainty of sight! Then (on that Day) you shall be asked about the delights (you indulged in, in this world)!&#8221;</span> (102:1-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(After reciting) he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Son of adam says: `My wealth, my wealth.&#8217; Do you own of your wealth other than what you eat and consume, and what you wear and wear out, or what you give in Sadaqah (charity) (to those who deserve it), and that what you will have in stock for yourself.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 56<br />
Excellence of Simple Living and being Content with Little</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e., made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), and work righteousness. Such will enter Jannah and they will not be wronged in aught.&#8221;</b></span><b> (19:59,60)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So he went forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: `Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun (Korah) has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8217; But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said: `Woe to you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous good deeds&#8217;.&#8221;</b></span><b> (28:79,80)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Then, on that Day, you shall be asked about the delights (you indulged in, in this world)!&#8221;</b></span><b> (102:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Whoever desires the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he will burn therein disgraced and rejected (far away from Allah&#8217;s Mercy).&#8221;</b></span><b> (17:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>491.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The family of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never ate to the fill the bread of barley for two successive days until he died.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Never did the family of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) eat to the fill, since their arrival to Al-Madinah, the bread of wheat for three successive nights until his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>492.</b> `Urwah from `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported that she used to say to Urwah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">:</span><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O son of my sister, by Allah, I used to see the new moon, then the new moon, then the new moon, i.e., three moons in two months, and a fire was not kindled in the house of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</span> &#8220;I (`Urwah) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O my aunt, what were your means of sustenance?&#8221;</span> She said;<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Dates and water. But it (so happened) that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had some Ansar neighbours who had milch animals. They used to send Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) some milk of their (animals) and he gave that to us to drink.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>493.</b> Abu Sa`id Maqburi reported: Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="color:#008000;"> said that he happened to pass by some people who had a roast lamb before them. They invited him, but he declined, saying: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) left the world without having eaten his fill with barley bread.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>494.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) neither ate on a dining cloth, nor ate soft bread throughout his life.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One narration adds:<span style="color:#008000;"> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never even saw a Samit lamb</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>495.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I have seen your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he did not find enough of even the inferior quality of dates to eat and fill his belly.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>496.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had never seen bread made out of fine flour throughout his life, since Allah commissioned him until his death.</span> He was asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Did you not have sieves at the time of the Messenger of Allah?&#8221;</span> He replied,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never saw a sieve.&#8221;</span> He was asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;How did you manage to eat barley bread made of unsieved flour?&#8221;</span> He said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8221;We used to ground it and then blew away the husk, and what remained we kneaded into dough.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>497.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went out (of his house) one day, or one night, and there he met Abu Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) also. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What made you leave your houses at this hour?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;It is hunger, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221;    He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, what made you leave, made me also leave,</span> so come along!&#8221; And he went along with them to a man from the Ansar, but they did not find him in his house. When the wife of that man saw the Prophet, she said, &#8220;You are most welcome.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to her,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Where is so-and-so?&#8221;</span> She said, &#8220;He went to fetch some fresh water for us.&#8221; In the meantime, the Ansari came back, saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his two companions and said: &#8220;Praise be to Allah, today no one has more honourable guests than I.&#8221; He then went out and brought them a bunch of date fruit, having dates, some still green, some ripe, and some fully ripe, and requested them to eat from it. He then took his knife (to slaughter a sheep). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not kill a milch sheep.&#8221;</span> So he slaughtered a sheep for them. After they had eaten and drunk to their fill, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to Abu Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them),<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, you will certainly be questioned about this treat on the Day of Resurrection. Hunger brought you out of your homes, and you do not return to your homes till you have been blessed with this treat.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>498.</b> Khalid bin `Umar Al-`Adawi reported: `Utbah bin Ghazwan, the governor of Basrah, delivered a Khutbah. He praised Allah, glorified Him, then said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Amma b`adu, verily, the world has been given the news of its end and is running to meet its end swiftly. Nothing is left out of it but a very little amount. Similar to the remainder in a dish whose owner is collecting it to drink; and you are going to move to an abode which knows no end, and you should proceed there with the good before you, for we have been informed (by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would travel down for seventy years but would not reach its bottom. By Allah, it will be filled (with men and jinn). Do you find it strange? We have been informed (i.e., by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) that the distance between two shutters of the gate of Jannah is forty years (distance). And a day would come when it would be fully packed; I was the seventh amongst the seven who had been with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the sides of our mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore into two and divided between myself and Sa`d bin Malik. I made the lower garment with half of it and so did Sa`d. Today, there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city, and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great while I am insignificant to Allah.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>499.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) showed us a sheet and a thick lower garment</span> and said to us<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was wearing them when he died.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>500.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> By Allah, I am the first Arab who shot an arrow in the Cause of Allah. We fought along with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when our food was only the leaves of Hublah and Samur trees (wild trees) until one of us would defecate like the droppings of sheep.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>501.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, make the provisions of family of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) bare subsistence.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>502.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: By Allah other than Whom there is none worthy of worship, I used to press my stomach against the earth owing to my hunger; I would tie a stone over it. One day, I was sitting on the way they usually take when the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by me. When he saw me he smiled at me and knew my condition and my feelings. He called me and I replied, &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Follow me.</span>&#8221; So I followed him. Having arrived at home, he sought permission and entered. He allowed me in and I, too, entered. He found milk in a bowl and asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Where is this from?&#8221;</span> He was told that it was a gift for him from so-and-so. He called me and I responded: &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go to the people of As-Suffah and usher them in.&#8221;</span> He Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) explained: The people of As-Suffah were guests of Islam; they had no family, no property and no relations. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to receive something in charity, he would send it to them without taking anything from it. When he received a present, he would send for them and share it with them. On this occasion, I disliked to give them anything. I said to myself: &#8220;This meagre quantity of milk will not be enough for all the people of As-Suffah! I am more deserving of it than anyone else. By drinking it I may attain some strength. When they come, he will order me to give it to them. I do not expect that anything will be left for me from this milk.&#8221; As there was no alternative but to obey Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I went and called them. They came and sought permission which was granted. They took their seats. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called me and I responded, &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Take the milk and give it to them.&#8221;</span> I took the bowl and gave it to one man who drank his fill and returned it to me, and I gave it to the next and he did the same. I went on doing this till the bowl reached Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). By that time all had taken their fill. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took the bowl, put it on his hand, looked at me, smiled and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Abu Hirr.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Now you and I are left.&#8217;</span>&#8216; I said, &#8220;That is true, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Sit down and drink.&#8221;</span> I drank, but he went on saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Drink some more.</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have no room for it.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then give it to me.&#8217;</span>&#8216; So I gave him the bowl. He praised Allah, uttered the Name of Allah and drank the remainder.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>503.</b> Muhammad bin Sirin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I would fall in swoon between the pulpit of (the mosque of) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the chamber of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) and every passer-by would put his foot on my neck thinking I was insane. I was not insane but I was awfully hungry.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>504.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) died, his armour was mortgaged with a Jew for thirty Sa` (measures) of barley.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>505.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> T</span>he Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mortgaged his armour for a quantity of barley, and I took to him some barley bread and rancid fat. I heard him saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The family of Muhammad never possessed a measure of wheat from dawn to dusk although they were nine houses (to feed).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>506.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw seventy of the people of As-Suffah and none of them had a cloak. They had either a lower cloth or a blanket which they suspended from their necks. Some reached half way down to the legs and some to the ankles, and one of them would manage to keep it in his hand to avoid exposing his private parts</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>507.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The mattress of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was a piece of tanned skin stuffed with palm fibres.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>508.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were once sitting in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when a man from the Ansar came and greeted. As he was leaving, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O brother of the Ansar, how is my brother Sa`d bin `Ubadah?</span>&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He is well.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Which of you is desirous of visiting him?&#8221;</span> Having said this he got up and we followed him. We were ten and odd in number and we had neither shoes nor light boots nor caps nor shirts. We walked on foot through the barren plain till we came to the residence of Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him). His people made way and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) along with those who accompanied him went up to him.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>509.</b> `Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The best of you, are my contemporaries, then those who follow them, then those who will come after them.</span> (`Imran said, I do not know if he said this twice or thrice).<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Then, they will be followed by those who will testify but will not be called upon to testify; they will betray the trust, and will not be trusted. They will make vows but will not fulfill them, and obesity will prevail among them.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>510.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O son of Adam, if you spend the surplus, it will be better for you; and if you retain it, it will be evil for you. You will not be reprimanded for storing what is enough for your need. First of all spend upon those who are your dependents.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>511.</b> `Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whosoever begins the day feeling family security and good health; and possessing provision for his day is as though he possesed the whole world.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>512.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Successful is the one who enters the fold of Islam and is provided with sustenance which is sufficient for his day&#8217;s needs, and Allah makes him content with what He has bestowed upon him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>513.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Happiness is due to him who is guided to Islam and possesses provision that suffices him for his day and remains content.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>514.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to bed hungry for several successive nights, nor did his family have a thing for supper for many consecutive nights; and their bread was mostly of barley.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>515.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led Salat, some people would fall down from their standing posture out of extreme hunger. They were of the people of As-Suffah. The nomad Arabs would say that they were insane. After concluding Salat, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would turn to them and say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you were to know what is in store for you with Allah, the Exalted, you would wish to augment your starvation and lack of provisions.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>516.</b> Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No man fills a container worse than his stomach. A few morsels that keep his back upright are sufficient for him. If he has to, then he should keep one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for his breathing.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>517.</b> Abu Umamah bin Tha`labah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Companions of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mentioned the life of the world before him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you not hear? Do you not hear? Simplicity (in life) is part of Faith, simplicity is part of Faith.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>518.</b> Jabir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent us in an expedition under the command of Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) to intercept a caravan of the Quraish. He provided us with a bag of dates, apart from which he found nothing for us. Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) gave each of us one date (every day). He (the narrator) was asked: &#8220;What did you do with that?&#8221; He said: We sucked that just like a baby and then drank water over that, and it was sufficient for us for the day until night. We beat off leaves with the help of our sticks, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then went to the seaside, when there appeared before us something like a big mound. We came near it and we found that it was a beast called Al-Anbar. Abu &#8216;Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;It is dead (so it useless for us).&#8221; He then said: &#8220;No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the way of Allah and you are hard-pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you can eat that.&#8221; We, three hundred in number, stayed there for a month until we fattened up (having plenty to eat of that fish). He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or almost like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) called thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he held one of its ribs and raised it erect and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had with us and it passed through it (the arched rib), and we carried large pieces of meat for use in our journey. When we came back to Al-Madinah we went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and told him about that, whereupon he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That was a sustenance Allah had brought forth for you. Do you have any piece of meat left with you, for us to eat.&#8221;</span> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We sent to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) some of that (meat) and he ate it.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>519.</b> Asma&#8217; bint Yazid (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The sleeves of the shirt of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) reached his wrists.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>520.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the battle of Al-Khandaq (the Trench), we were digging the trench when a very hard boulder came in our way. The Companions went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and told him about it. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I will go down the trench to see it.&#8221;</span> He stood up and it was noticed that he had tied a stone over his stomach due to intense hunger. We had not tasted anything for three days. He took up a spade and struck the hard rock with it and it turned into sand. I sought his permission to go home, (after reaching home I) said to my wife, &#8220;I have seen the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a state that I am unable to endure. Have you got anything in the house?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have a small quantity of barley and a lamb.&#8221; I slaughtered the lamb, ground the barley and put the meat in the cooking pot. Then I went to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). In the meantime the flour had been kneaded and the meat in the pot was nearly cooked. I said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I have some food, will you come along with one or two Companions?&#8221; He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How many men should go there?&#8221;</span> I told him the number. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It will be better if they are more in number. Tell your wife not to remove the pot from the hearth nor the bread from the oven till I arrive.&#8221;</span> Then he said to the Muhajirun and the Ansar:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let us go (to eat).&#8221;</span>  They all rose (and went with him). I went to my wife and said, &#8220;Bless you, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), the Muhajirun, the Ansar and the whole company are coming.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Did he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ask you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. (When they arrived) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to his Companions,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Enter, but do not crowd in.</span>&#8221; Then he started breaking up the bread and putting meat on it. He would take from the pot and the oven then would cover them up, approach his Companions and hand it over to them. He would then go back and uncover the pot and the oven. He continued to break up the bread and put meat on it till all had eaten to their fill and still some of the food remained. Then he said to my wife,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>Eat from it, and send it as a present, for the people have been afflicted with severe hunger.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Jabir said: When the trench was being dug, I noticed the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I returned to my wife and said to her, &#8220;Have you got anything in the house? I have seen the signs of severe hunger on the face of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; She brought out a bag which contained a Sa` (a measure that equals approximately 3kg.) of barley. We had a lamb which was reared in the home. I slaughtered the lamb and she ground the flour for baking bread. I then cut the meat and put it in the cooking pot. When I was returning to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), my wife said to me, &#8220;Do not embarass me before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions.&#8221; (She said this because she thought that the food would not be enough for everyone, for how can very little food cater for a thousand people?) When I came to him, I said to him in a low tone, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we have slaughtered a small lamb and have ground a Sa` of barley. Please accompany me with a few of your Companions<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; Thereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) announced in a loud voice,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people of the Trench, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so all of you are welcome.</span>&#8221; And addressing me he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not take the pot off the fire, nor bake the kneaded flour till I arrive.</span>&#8221; So I came home and he came ahead of the people. My wife said, &#8220;It will be a matter of disgrace for you (because there is not enough food).&#8221; I said, &#8220;I did only what you told me.&#8221; She brought out the kneaded flour and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) spat into it, and invoked the blessing of Allah on  it, and then he spat into the cooking pot and invoked the blessing of Allah on it. Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Call another woman to help bake bread and let her take out from the cooking pot, but do not take it off the fire.&#8221;</span> There were about a thousand guests. All of them ate till they left the food and went off. Our pot still bubbled as before and the dough was being baked as before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>521.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) said to (to his wife) Umm Sulaim(May Allah be pleased with her), &#8220;I noticed some weakness in the voice of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and I feel it was due to hunger. Have you got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So she brought out barley loaves, took off her head covering, in a part of which she wrapped these loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it. She then sent me to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I set forth and found Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sitting in the mosque in the company of some people. I stood near them whereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Has Abu Talhah sent you?</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Thereupon he said to those who were with him to get up (and follow him). He went forth and so did I, ahead of them until I came to Abu Talhah and informed him. Abu Talhah said, &#8220;O Umm Sulaim, here comes Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) along with the people and we do not have enough (food) to feed them.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; Abu Talhah went out (to receive him) until he met Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and he came forward along with him until they both (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) came in. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) s<span style="color:#0000ff;">aid, &#8220;O Umm Sulaim, bring forth what you have with you.&#8221;</span> So she brought the bread. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded that the bread be broken into small pieces and after Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) had squeezed clarified butter out of a butter container and made it just like soup. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) recited over it what Allah wished him to recite. He then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allow ten guests to come in.&#8221;</span> They ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) again said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allow ten (more to come in)&#8221;</span>, and he (the host) ushered them in. They ate to their fill. Then they went out. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) again said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allow ten (more),</span>&#8221; until all the people ate to their fill. They were seventy or eighty persons.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: Anas said:<span style="color:#008000;"> When all had eaten, the remaining food was collected. It was as much as there was in the beginning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet another narration is: Anas said:<span style="color:#008000;"> The groups of ten people ate by turn. After eighty persons had eaten, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the family of that house ate, and there was still a quantity left over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I visited Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) one day, and found him sitting in the company of his Companions, with a belt tied over his waist. I asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Why has Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) tied the belt on his waist?</span>&#8221; I was told,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Due to hunger.&#8221;</span> I went to Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) the husband of Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) and said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O father, I have seen Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) with a belt tied over his waist</span>.<span style="color:#008000;"> I asked one of his Companions about the reason of it and he said that it was on account of severe hunger.</span>&#8221; Abu Talhah  (May Allah be pleased with him) went to my mother and asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Have you got anything?</span>&#8221; She said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Yes.</span> I have a piece of bread and some dry dates. Were Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to come alone, we could feed him his fill, but if he comes along with others, there would not be enough food.&#8221; Anas then narrated the Hadith in full.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 57<br />
Contentment and Self-esteem and avoidance of unnecessary begging of People</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah.&#8221;</b></span><b> (11:6)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;(Charity is) for Fuqara (the poor), who in Allah&#8217;s Cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land (for trade or work). The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark, they do not beg of people at all.&#8221;</b></span><b> (2:273)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes).&#8221;</b></span><b> (25:67)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone). I seek not any provision from them (i.e., provision for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed Me (i.e., feed themselves or My creatures).&#8221;</b></span><b> (51:56,57)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>522.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Richness is not the abundance of wealth, rather it is self-sufficiency.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>523.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Successful is the one who has entered the fold of Islam and is provided with sustenance which is sufficient for his needs, and Allah makes him content with what He has bestowed upon him.&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>524.</b> Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I begged Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he gave me; I begged him again and he gave me. I begged him again and he gave me and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Hakim, wealth is pleasant and sweet. He who acquires it with self-contentment, it becomes a source of blessing for him; but it is not blessed for him who seeks it out of greed. He is like one who goes on eating but his hunger is not satisfied. The upper hand is better than the lower one.</span>&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, by Him Who sent you with the Truth I will not, after you, ask anyone for anything till I leave this world.&#8221; So Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) would summon Hakim (May Allah be pleased with him) to give his rations, but he would refuse.  Then &#8216;Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) would call him but he would decline to accept anything. So &#8216;Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said addressing Muslims: &#8220;O Muslims, I ask you to bear testimony that I offer Hakim his share of the booty that Allah has assigned for him but he refuses my offer.&#8221; Thus Hakim did not accept anything from anyone after the death of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), till he died.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>525.</b> Abu Burdah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Six of us accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in an expedition. We had one camel with us; we rode it in turn. Our feet got injured and my nails also fell out. We wrapped up our feet in rags; and because of this the campaign came to be known as Dhat-ur-Riqa` (the Campaign of Rags).</span>&#8221; Abu Burdah (May Allah be pleased with him) says:<span style="color:#008000;"> Abu Musa reported this Hadith but regretted having done so</span>. He said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Would that I had not mentioned it</span>!&#8221; He said so because he disliked to disclose anything concerning his deeds.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>526.</b> `Amr bin Taghlib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Some booty or prisoners of war were brought to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he distributed them, giving some men and neglecting others. Then, he was informed that those whom he had not given a thing were displeased. On this the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) praised Allah and glorified Him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is a fact that I give to one and overlook another. The one I ignore is dearer to me than the one I give. I give to those in whose hearts I perceive anxiety; others I leave with the richness and contentment that Allah has put in their hearts. One of them is `Amr bin Taghlib.</span>&#8221; Upon this `Amr bin Taghlib said, &#8220;By Allah I shall not accept a herd of red camels in exchange for what the Prophet said (about me).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>527.</b> Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The upper hand is better than the lower one; and begin (charity) with those who are under your care; and the best charity is (the one which is given) out of surplus; and he who wishes to abstain from begging will be protected by Allah; and he who seeks self-sufficiency will be made self-sufficient by Allah.&#8221;  </span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>528.</b> Abu Sufyan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not be importunate in begging. By Allah! If one of you asks me for something and I give it to him unwillingly, there is no blessing in what I give him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>529.</b> `Auf bin Malik Al-Ashja`i (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Seven, eight or nine people, including myself, were with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on an occasion when he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Would you pledge allegiance to Messenger of Allah?&#8221;</span> As we had taken oath of allegiance shortly before, we said, &#8220;We have already done so, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He again asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Would you not pledge allegiance to Messenger of Allah?</span>&#8221; So we stretched out our hands and said, &#8220;We have already made our pledge with you, O Messenger of Allah, on what should we make a pledge with you?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;To worship Allah and not to associate anything with Him, to perform the five (daily) Salat and to obey.</span>&#8221; Then he added in a low tone,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;And not to ask people for anything.</span>&#8221; Thereafter, I noticed that some of these people who were present did not ask anyone to pick up even the whip for them if it fell from their hands. [Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>530.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If one of you would keep begging (of people) until he meets Allah (on the Day of Resurrection) his face will be without a shred of flesh.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>531.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: While Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was on his pulpit (in the mosque) delivering a Khutbah (religious talk) about Sadaqah (charity) and begging, he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The upper hand is better than the lower hand, the upper hand is the one which gives and the lower hand is the begging one.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>532.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who begs to increase his riches is in fact asking only for a live coal. It is up to him to decrease it or increase it.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>533.</b> Samurah bin Jundub (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Begging is a cut that a person inflicts upon his face; except for asking a ruler, or under the stress of circumstances from which there is no escape.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>534.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who suffers poverty and seeks relief from people, he will not be relieved; but he who seeks relief from Allah Alone, he will be relieved sooner or later.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>535.</b> Thauban (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who guarantees me that he will not beg anything from anyone, I will guarantee him (to enter) Jannah.</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;I give you the guarantee.&#8221; Then Thauban (May Allah be pleased with him) never begged anything from anyone.<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>536.</b> Qabisah bin Al-Mukhariq (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I stood as surety for a debt and came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to seek his help in discharging it. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Wait till we receive charity and I shall give you out of it.&#8217;</span>&#8216; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Qabisah, begging is not lawful except for three people. One who has incurred debt (for assuming guarantee), for him begging is permissible till the guarantee is discharged and he should then refrain; a person whose property has been destroyed by a calamity is allowed to beg till he attains self-sufficiency; a person who meets with dire necessity (due to hunger) provided that three men of understanding from his people affirm the genuineness (of his poverty), for him begging is lawful till he attains means of his subsistence. Other than these, O Qabisah, anything received through begging is unlawful, its recipient devours it unlawfully.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>537.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A needy person is not the one who goes from door to door, begging and is turned away with a morsel or two or with a date or two. But a needy person is the one who does not have enough to live upon, and neither from his appearance it occurs that he is needy and should be given alms, nor does he himself beg anything from others.&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Procrastination (delay) in paying  debts by a wealthy man is injustice. So, if your debt is transferred from your debtor to a  rich debtor, you should agree.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Procrastination (delay) in paying  debts by a wealthy person is injustice. So, if your debt is transferred from your debtor  to a rich debtor, you should agree.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488r: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a  dead man was brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the  deceased. He said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; The people replied in the negative. He said,  &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So, he led his funeral  prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead  his funeral prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8221;Three  Dinars.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said  (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral prayer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any  wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  (&#8220;Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.&#8217;, He (refused to pray and) said, &#8220;Then pray  for your (dead) companion.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead his  funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.488h"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488h: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;An Israeli man asked another  Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former  replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;I want a surety.&#8217; The  former replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;You are right,&#8217; and  lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished  his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of  the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it,  inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e.  sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. &#8216;O Allah! You  know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety  from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your  guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a  Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so  that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.&#8217; Saying  that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he  went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the  creditor&#8217;s country. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a  ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which  his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found  his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one  thousand Dinars to him and said, &#8216;By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I  could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8217; The  lender asked, &#8216;Have you sent something to me?&#8217; The debtor replied, &#8216;I have told you I  could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.&#8217; The lender said, &#8216;Allah has  delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your  one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;In the verse: To every one We have  appointed &#8216; (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one&#8217;s) heirs (4.33).&#8217; (And regarding the verse) &#8216;And  those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;When the  emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the  latter&#8217;s relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the  Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: &#8216;And  to everyone We have appointed heirs&#8217; (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the bond (the  pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance).&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;The verse: To  those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation  and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible  to assign something in one&#8217;s testament to the person who had the right of inheriting  before. </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.490"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 490: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came to us and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Rabi&#8217;a. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.491"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 491: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik, &#8220;Have you ever heard that the  Prophet said, &#8216;There is no alliance in Islam?&#8217; &#8221; He replied, &#8220;The Prophet made  alliance between Quarish and the Ansar in my house.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.492"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 492: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might  lead the funeral prayer for him. He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; When the people  replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead person was brought and he  asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He (refused to lead the  prayer and) said, &#8220;Lead the prayer of your friend.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I undertake to pay his debt.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then led his funeral  prayer. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.493"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 493: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet said (to me), &#8220;If the money of  Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it.&#8221; The Prophet had breathed his  last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr  announced, &#8220;Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us.&#8221; I went to  Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet promised me so and so.&#8221; Abu Bakr gave me a  handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then  said, &#8220;Take twice the amount you have taken (besides).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.494"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could  remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam.  Not a single day passed but Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the  evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant.  When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara  tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;My people  have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my  Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &#8220;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be  turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and  kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help  people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at  your home.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of  Quraish saying to them, &#8220;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned  out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with  Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the  people during their troubles?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna&#8217;s guarantee of protection  and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, &#8220;Advise Abu Bakr to  worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and  not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.&#8221;  Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in  his house and did not pray or recite Qur&#8217;an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr  had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea  and started praying and reciting Qur&#8217;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the  pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a  softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&#8217;an. This horrified the  pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &#8220;We  have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house,  but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his  house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&#8217;an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead  our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his  Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as  we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr&#8217;s  public declaration of Islam (his worshipping).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said,  &#8220;You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide  by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the &#8216;Arabs saying  that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not  respect it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied  with Allah&#8217;s protection.&#8221; At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was still in Mecca and he said  to his companions, &#8220;Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty  land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two  ,Harras.&#8221; So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina,  and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared  for emigration, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Wait, for I expect to be permitted to  emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you  really expect that?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr  postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah&#8217;s Apostle and fed two camels which he  had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months. </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.495"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  he would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to repay his debt?&#8221; If he was informed that  he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he  would tell the Muslims to offer their friend&#8217;s funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet  wealthy through conquests, he said, &#8220;I am more rightful than other believers to be  the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the  repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his  heirs. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we were with Ibrahim, we talked about mortgaging in  deals of Salam. Ibrahim narrated from Aswad that &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8220;The Prophet bought  some foodstuff on credit from a Jew and mortgaged an iron armor to him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes the money of the  people with the intention of repaying it, Allah will repay it on his behalf, and whoever  takes it in order to spoil it, then Allah will spoil him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the  mountain of Uhud and said, &#8220;I would not like to have this mountain turned into gold  for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me for more than  three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in Allah&#8217;s Cause), except that Dinar which I will  keep for repaying debts.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Those who are rich in this world would  have little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here and there (in  Allah&#8217;s Cause), and they are few in number.&#8221; Then he ordered me to stay at my place  and went not far away. I heard a voice and intended to go to him but I remembered his  order, &#8220;Stay at your place till I return.&#8221; On his return I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! (What was) that noise which I heard?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Did you hear  anything?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Gabriel came and said to me,  &#8216;Whoever amongst your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter  Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even if he stole  or committed illegal sexual intercourse)&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man demanded his debts from Allah&#8217;s Apostle in such a  rude manner that the companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but the Prophet said,  &#8220;Leave him, no doubt, for he (the creditor) has the right to demand it (harshly). Buy  a camel and give it to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;The camel that is available is older  than the camel he demands. &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;Buy it and give it to him, for  the best among you are those who repay their debts handsomely. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud,  and he was in debt. His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to the  Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the fruits of my garden and  exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give  them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early  in the morning and wandered among the datepalms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I  then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for  us. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates).  I requested him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with the Jew. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to the Jew and asked him to accept  the fruits of my trees in place of the debt but the Jew refused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered  the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying),  &#8220;Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due.&#8221; So, I plucked the fruits for him  after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen  Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to inform of what had  happened, but found him praying the &#8216;Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the  extra fruits which remained. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me to inform (Umar) Ibn Al-Khatab about  it. When I went to &#8216;Umar and told him about it, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle  walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah would definitely bless it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died, he left behind children  and debts. I asked the lenders to put down some of his debt, but they refused, so I went  to the Prophet to intercede with them, yet they refused. The Prophet said (to me),  &#8220;Classify your dates into their different kinds: &#8216;Adhq bin Zaid, Lean and &#8216;Ajwa, each  kind alone and call all the creditors and wait till I come to you.&#8221; I did so and the  Prophet came and sat beside the dates and started measuring to each his due till he paid  them fully, and the amount of dates remained as it was before, as if he had not touched  them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(On another occasion) I took part in one of Ghazawat among  with the Prophet and I was riding one of our camels. The camel got tired and was lagging  behind the others. The Prophet hit it on its back. He said, &#8220;Sell it to me, and you  have the right to ride it till Medina.&#8221; When we approached Medina, I took the permission  from the Prophet to go to my house, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have newly  married.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or  divorcee)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have married a matron, as &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died and  left behind daughters small in their ages, so I married a matron who may teach them and  bring them up with good manners.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to me), &#8220;Go to your  family.&#8221; When I went there and told my maternal uncle about the selling of the camel,  he admonished me for it. On that I told him about its slowness and exhaustion and about  what the Prophet had done to the camel and his hitting it. When the Prophet arrived, I  went to him with the camel in the morning and he gave me its price, the camel itself, and  my share from the war booty as he gave the other people. </font></p>

I went to him to demand it, but he said to me,  &#8220;I will not pay you unless you reject faith in Muhammad.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;By  Allah, I will never disbelieve Muhammad till Allah let you die and then resurrect  you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then wait till I die and come to life again, for then I will be  given property and offspring and will pay your right.&#8221; So, thus revelation came:  &#8220;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and yet says, &#8216;I will be given  property and offspring?&#8217; &#8221; (19.77) </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Abdullah Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhuma) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While on the Ark, [Prophet] Nooh (&#8216;alayhis-salam) noticed an old man whom he did not recognise. Nooh inquired: &#8216;What brought you here?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;I came to strike the hearts of your followers, so their hearts become with me, while their bodies with you.&#8217; Nooh responded: &#8216;Leave O enemy of Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis said: &#8216;There are five things that cause people to become destroyed (deviated). I will inform you of three and not of the other two&#8217;. It was revealed to Nooh that he needed not know the three, but that he should enquire about the two.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis said: &#8216;The two that are certain to work are: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>envy</strong></span>: I was cursed because of my envy, and became a stoned devil. And the second is <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">eagerness (to have more)</span></strong> : The entire paradise was made permissible to Adam (&#8216;alayhis-salam) . I got what I wanted from him because of his eagerness.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Browse by Volume Number &gt; Group 1 &gt; Volume 13: Transactions 1 &gt; Buyu` &gt; <a title="" href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Tree&amp;NodeID=3576&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Payment of the price</a> &gt; Repaying a debt in the same currency no matter whether its value increases or decrease</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I borrowed 20,000 Pakistani Rupees, which were worth 7,000 Saudi Riyals at that time, from my brother. I now want to settle my debt, but the debt of 20,000 Pakistani Rupees is now worth 2,000 Saudi Riyals. Is it permissible for me to repay him with 2,000 Riyals or do I have to give him 7,000 Riyals according to the value when I borrowed it, or is it obligatory on me to give it to him in Pakistani Rupees, the same currency that I borrowed from him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on you to return the money that you borrowed from your brother in the same currency you took it from him, regardless of whether its value has risen or fallen against other currencies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You therefore have to give him 20,000 Pakistani Rupees, no more or less, for the 20,000 Pakistani Rupees you borrowed. You have to give him what equals its value at the time of the repayment in another currency, such as in Saudi Riyals or another currency, on the condition that it is done in one session. This is based on the answer which the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave to the inquirer who asked him whether it was permissible to sell Dirhams (a dirham of silver equals 2.975 grams of silver) for Dinars (old Arab coin that equals 2.975 grams of gold) or Dinars for Dirhams. He (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">“There is nothing wrong with taking them at the current rate so long as you do not separate leaving something to be settled.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling about having shares in companies and banks&#8217;? And is it permissible for a shareholder (in a company or a bank) to sell shares, specifically after he has become a shareholder himself, to offices dealing in buying and selling (stockbrokers)? And from that which is possible is selling them (the shares) for more than the price that the shareholder paid. So what is the ruling about the profit which the shareholder makes every year from the value of the shares bought?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having shares in banks and companies that trade in ribaa is not permissible. And if the shareholder wants to rid himself of any ribaa in his shareholding, then he should sell his shares at market value and take the initial investment only. The rest he should give in charity, and it is not permissible for him to take anything from the profits of his shareholding or interest. However, if the shareholding was in a company which does not trade in ribaa, then it&#8217;s profits are halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><strong>Question</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Islaamic Bank has shares for sale and the value of each share is one hundred and ten US dollars ($110). And that which we have understood is that the bank in question does not trade in ribaa and that the money from the sale of the shares will be used in trading activities which are free from any dealings in interest. The profits will then be divided amongst the shareholders. So out of concern of falling into that which is impermissible, we request you to give a fatwa about whether this is permissible or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to have shares in a bank which does not trade in ribaa, and the profits which accrue from these shares are the result of trading which is not haraam , so it is halaal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Overview</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee?<br />
He is from amongst the senior (eldest) students of Imaam Muqbil Ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah), to the extent that Shaykh Muqbil referred to Shaykh Muhammad as &#8216;my khaleefah.&#8217; His specialty is in Fiqh (Islaamic jurisprudence), and he has a centre of Islaamic studies in Hudaydah, Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Lecture :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee states, &#8216;If the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards gaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned and carries these legislated means out, he will have gained what has been promised to him. Sometimes these doors are called the door towards attaining sustenance or the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the doors are :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness in the Religion) : Allaah says, &#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217; So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, a door from the doors of sustenance.<br />
2. Eemaan (Faith) : al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief of difficulty, a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision). &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and his books, and his angels, the last day, qadr (divine decree), its good and it&#8217;s bad, the Qur&#8217;aan, the Rasool (Messenger), the pure prophetic Sunnah and what is contains.<br />
3. Taqwaa (Fear and consciousness of Allaah) : &#8216;And if the people of the towns had Taqwaa and had piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn..&#8217; Whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah provides for him from where he would never have expected, where his mind would never have though about. However, Taqwaa of Allaah provided these means for him and gave him ease.<br />
4. Tawakkal ilallaah (having trust in Allaah) : If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.<br />
5. Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : Not giving shukr decreases one&#8217;s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. &#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.&#8217;<br />
6. Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : A person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br />
7. Zakaat (Charity) : It is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with Zakaat, it is from the five pillars of Islaam. Give Zakaat from the apparent and the non-apparent, from the jewellery and possessions.<br />
8. Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : &#8216;Spending on one&#8217;s parents, family and companions. The angels make du&#8217;aa for the one who spends, that Allaah replenishes them, and another makes du&#8217;aa that the one who refrains from spending that his wealth is destroyed. Allaah says &#8216;whoever does even an atoms worth he will see it and whoever spends in the path of Allaah, Allaah will replace it&#8217;.<br />
9. Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) : Allaah says, &#8216;Call on Me and I will answer you&#8217;. Allaah orders us to supplicate; supplication should be made for one&#8217;s rizq. &#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this life and the hereafter and save us from the Fire&#8217;. The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to say this du&#8217;aa.<br />
10. al-Birr (The Righteous) : A door from the doors of relief, &#8216;Verily the pious people will be in the paradise and the evil doers will be in the hellfire Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) stated that this ayah refers to the dunyaa (worldly life), the barzakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aakhirah (hereafter) contrary to what people comprehend.<br />
11. Material Means : The means from the material means are also from the means of sustenance but self-control must be observed, knowing that dependency is upon Allaah alone. It is merely a means by which you work. We Should say &#8216;O Allaah, this is the means by which you provide for me if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah provided we wouldn&#8217;t have used it. When Maryam (alayhis-salaam) was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says &#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm before you and it will provide ripe dates for you. We are not dervishes who do nothing, we work by the means but we do not go by means which are unlegislated by Allaah. Many of those who are obsessed with their means fall to diabetes and Cancer, their minds obsessed with their work.<br />
12. Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : And if only they had established the Toraah and the Injeel, they would have eaten from above them and under their feet.&#8217; If this is in regards to those who should have held on to the scriptures then it is pivotal to hold on to the book and the Sunnah. We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mention the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura&#8217;an and of the Messenger has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called &#8216;Abwaabur Rizq&#8217; or &#8216;Abwaabul Furaj&#8217; i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say &#8216;Abwaabul Rizq&#8217; – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say &#8216;Asbaabur Rizq&#8217; i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura&#8217;an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :<br />
1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah) : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says,<br />
&#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217;<br />
So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the &#8216;Asbaab-al-Shar&#8217;eeah&#8217; – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn&#8217;t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We made all things living from water.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :<br />
&#8216;and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.&#8217;<br />
And Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That is verily those who say, &#8220;Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, &#8216;have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.<br />
Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Maad&#8217; that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid&#8217;ah, no khurafaath (superstitions &amp; folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no &#8216;liwaath&#8217; &#8212; no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no &#8216;shahaadatuz zoor&#8217; &#8212; bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn&#8217;t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.<br />
And the second means is Eemaan and Taqwa : i.e the second and third. Now we have three means, Eemaan and Taqwa. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :<br />
&#8221;And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwaa or piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied or denied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn. Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allaah? None feels secure from the plan of Allaah except the people who are losers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first three means he returns he says with the ayah : walaw anna ahlal Qura ..&#8217; and &#8216;Qura&#8217; here encompasses al-Qura wal Mudah. i.e the word Qura means villages and he says this ayah encompasses both villages and cities. And Makkah is the Ummul Qura as you know. This is not specific to villages but on the contrary villages, cities and all. He repeats the ayah :<br />
&#8216;If only the people of the cities had believed and had taqwa, We would have opened for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;<br />
Henceforth al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty, and a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision) and a means from the means Rizq. &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and His Books, and His angels, the Last Day and in Qadr (Divine decree), its good and its bad, the belief or Eemaan in the Qur&#8217;aan and in what the Qur&#8217;aan contains, Eemaan in the Rasool (Messenger) and what he came with from Allaah, Eemaan in the pure prophetic Sunnah and what it contains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If they believed and had piety, We would have opened up for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He said (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :<br />
&#8216;And whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah makes for him a way out and provides for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br />
The Sheikh reiterates that &#8216;He would have provided for him from where he never would have expected – from where his mind would never have thought about it. And hence not expecting that he would find this prepared blessing, the blessed sustenance from this source. However, taqwa of Allaah prepared for him these different ways and made ease for him the means.&#8217;<br />
The Sheikh reiterates: &#8216;He would make for him a way out and provide for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br />
We want rizq. However we lost gaining it by its legislated ways except whom Allaah has had mercy on. Rizq by lying and playing and zig zagging, stealing and deceit, evil plotting : &#8216;O people&#8217; the Sheikh implores : Is this the way to get rizq? You are right now spreading up the establishment, you are right now speeding up the establishment of punishment on yourself and torment if you disobey Allaah. Therefore why not hold onto the deen and have glad tidings of good and have glad tidings of relief from hardship?<br />
So right now we have three doors : Al-Istiqaamah, al-Eemaan and Taqwa.<br />
The fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi &amp; Ahmad) &#8216;If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.&#8217;<br />
At-tawakkal alallaah – &#8216;having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.<br />
He alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds. That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don&#8217;t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :<br />
&#8216;And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.&#8217;<br />
He is talking about the &#8216;Lawh al Mahfudh&#8217; &#8212; the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.<br />
&#8216; We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Sheikh reiterates : Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don&#8217;t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don&#8217;t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the &#8216;Musabbibul Asbaab&#8217; – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that is best without torment, without toil and adverse hardship and that is the way that is best. No more than a means. For example the cure for a disease – a mere means. A man is sick and they say he is tired and sick. Give him some black seed or a little honey or give him some pure milk to drink. Someone has an acidic stomach – so pure milk is good for his stomach. A small thing in a way that is good. And Allaah healed him. Do cupping for him or cauterization (healing with fire).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said : &#8216;A cure is in three things. In drinking a little bit of honey, or in the line that a person who does cupping draws (puts marks on your skin) or in the using of the fire (cauterization).&#8217; And this is in Bukhari in the Book of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mere means that they used to do in the past. Someone got sick in the times of the Salaf and their medicine was very simple – maybe with 5 Riyals or 6 Riyals. Not like now where a man may have to sell his house, his property and his car and sell and sell and sell so that he can go around and get treatment, go abroad and get treatment and if he had taqwa of Allaah azzawajal he would have got cured with 5 Riyals easily. However, when they opposed look at the punishment? And they didn&#8217;t depend upon Allaah, they depended upon the pocket, upon their money, upon his pocket, upon his money, and leaned on himself and didn&#8217;t lean on Allaah and in turn Allaah entrusted them to their own selves. My slave did not trust in Me and depended on himself so Allaah entrusted him to himself. So he sells what he owns and he returns sick – the same way he went. Sometimes even more sick and he dies there. And they comes with him dead, wrapped up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be tawakkal alallaah along with carrying out the legislated means. The salaf there used to be from them who used to sell oil and this is present in the biographies of the narrators of Hadeeth – so and so, the son of so and so As-Zayyaath. Meaning he sells zaith – olive oil and such. He spends on himself and his immediate and extended family. So and so, the son of so and so as-Sammaam – he sells saman which is called ghee (a butter material from cattle) and he spends on himself and his family. So and so, the son of so and so al- Assaal – he sells honey. So and so, the son of so and so is al-Hannar – he sells wheat; and they depend on Allaah. Right now you&#8217;ll find in most stores and supermarkets – in some of them you will find a thousand type of products as if he wants to put the whole dunya into his pocket.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then said something that was not clear and he continued. He made distrust and greed and toil and adverse hardship and they lost the Deen except whom Allaah had mercy on. Now we have four means from the means of sustenance.<br />
The fifth door is Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : &#8216;And when your Lord proclaimed that if you give thanks, I would increase you and if you deny the blessings then verily My torment is severe. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where is Ash-Shukr these day Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says. You have a 100 Riyals, you gave thanks to Allaah without saying &#8216;what is this, it is just a little bit, this is not enough&#8217;. The people they have and they have and you didn&#8217;t say this. You leave the speech of the ignorant people. Give thanks to your Lord for a quarter of a Riyal and give thanks to your Lord for the excrement of the feces. If it wasn&#8217;t for Allaah it wouldn&#8217;t come out. Yes by Allaah the excretion is a very big Ni&#8217;maah. If it didn&#8217;t come out you would have been befallen by poison and death. Don&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t have. Has Allaah given me and the people who have and have and have and then they make it hard and then you forget what Allaah gave you of blessings. Don&#8217;t you know that giving shukr is a means of increasing your rizq and not giving shukr is a means of decreasing of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh reiterates : &#8216;If you give thanks, We will increase you.&#8217; If you give thanks to Allaah for a 100/- Allaah increases for you upon it and then it becomes 500/-. If you give thanks to Allaah for 500/- Allaah increases it for you and then it becomes a 1000/-. And the more you give thanks the more Allaah increases you. Allaah does not go back on a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be Shukr and Hamd, giving praise and Sana&#8217;a (giving praises of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and Eemaan that it is Allaah who provided it for you. Allaah is the One Who provides and He is the One who gives life. He is the One Who gives death and He is the One who does everything (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and as for the people then they are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O mankind it is you who stands in need of Allaah but Allaah is rich and free of all needs. If He wished He could destroy you and bring another creation and that is not at all hard upon Allaah. The people all of them are fuqaraahu ilallaah. They are poor people with regards to Allaah so don&#8217;t look at their pockets. Look to Allaah. Look to the treasures of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;For Allaah is the treasures of the heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites do not understand this. The munaafiqun, the hypocrites they always believe and have faith in the material things and as for the unseen things, then they don&#8217;t believe. Only in material things 1+1 = 2. Something material, tangible, calculated. Faith in the unseen – this is not present with him. This is present with the believers. For this Allaah said about the Munaafiqeen : They say, &#8216;Spend not on those who are around Allah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him. They said make it hard for them with regards to charity and donation until they leave from Muhammad and were finished from Islaam and its people.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones who said that : don&#8217;t spend on the Messenger – the people that are around the Messenger of Allaah until they leave from him. So Allaah said refuting them :<br />
And for Allaah are the treasures of the Heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites they understand not. So beware of being from the Munaafiqeen that don&#8217;t understand the Book and the Sunnah and the ones that don&#8217;t believe except in material things. They don&#8217;t have eemaan in the unseen, untangible things and pursue the Deen of Allaah, and learn the Book and the Sunnah, and act upon it and spread it to the people because Allaah says : We have neglected nothing in the Book, everything is present in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have now 5 ways. So shukr &#8212; always make your tongue accustomed to Shukr of Allaah, upon His blessings even if it is a little. Because it is something enormous with Allaah. First of all you are ordered to give Shukr. Then He mentions the ayah :<br />
&#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful So you have to thank Allaah.&#8217;<br />
It is a saying of the Prophet : &#8216;So you have to thank Allaah. Whoever doesn&#8217;t thank Allaah doesn&#8217;t thank the people. &#8216;It is also in the hadith that whoever has helped you : say Jazakallaahu khaira. Don&#8217;t&#8217; say : what has he given me? Such and such…this is nothing. By Allaah this is a catastrophe for the one that doesn&#8217;t accustom himself to giving shukr i.e he doesn&#8217;t have except denial of the favours of Allaah and His creation. You should do the contrary, accustom yourself to giving thanks and be from the thankful people. And Allaah (azzawajal) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those before you, if you make shirk then all your deeds will be in vain. And you will certainly be among the losers. Nay, but worship Allaah and be among the grateful. Be from the grateful. Give thanks to Him for everything.<br />
Do you not see that if Allaah did not make the sleep for you, what would you do? The rest of the people are asleep and comfortable at night and you don&#8217;t have sleep night after night after night. Is it torment or isn&#8217;t it? It is ni&#8217;maah, the blessing of sleep. How much does it equal? The ni&#8217;mah of security, how much does it equal? He mentioned the Surah :<br />
[106] Surah Quraish (The Tribe of Quraish)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. For the Ilaf of the Quraysh.) (2. Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) (3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) (4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
Al-Aman – security or safety is a ni&#8217;mah. You must single Allaah in worship. He Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said : You must worship (Allaah) the Lord of this House (the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah), the One who fed you against hunger and made you safe from fear. You must sacrifice for Allaah alon, you don&#8217;t make vows except for Allaah, and you don&#8217;t swear except by Allaah and you don&#8217;t put your trust except in Allaah and he goes on to mentioning a hadeeth about tawakkal :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Allaah put your trust if indeed you are believers. Verily Allaah loves those who trust in Allaah. Then upon Allaah let the people put their trust in. Then upon Allaah let the believers put their trust in.<br />
There must be a firm holding on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and their must be obedience to the Messenger if we want success and salvation in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. So Ash-Shukr is the fifth.<br />
And the sixth : Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : Because Allaah says :<br />
&#8216;Whoever who turns away from the dhikr of Ar-Rahman, We would put for him a shaitaan to be a companion for him.&#8217;<br />
He says :<br />
&#8220;And whoever turns away from My remembrance then verily for him is a wretched life. And We will raise him up on the Day of Judgement blind. He will say, &#8216;O Lord why did you raise me up blind when I used to be able to see?&#8217; He will say that it is the same way that My ayath had come to you and you forgot them and this day, you will be forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he went away from the remembrance of Allaah and his obedience, Allaah punished him with a wretched life, hard life, tiresome. However, if he was the opposite i.e if he didn&#8217;t turn away from the remembrance of Allaah on the contrary took towards the remembrance of Allaah and took towards the obedience of Allaah, he will not in this case have wretched life but a pleasant and comfortable life of course. Henceforth pay attention. Those who turn away do not have reward and those who turn to Allaah have a reward i.e. a person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br />
The Sheikh reiterates :<br />
&#8216;Whoever turns away from My remembrance then for him is a wretched life.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He turned away from the remembrance of Allaah and the thanks of Allaah and the obedience of Allaah so Allaah punished him with a wretched life. He doesn&#8217;t attain his morsel of livelihood except after a day of great hardship – after having reached the verge of death, after having had a toil of a donkey and the toil of a camel and having seen different forms of death repeatedly, he attains his morsel of livelihood or drink of water. However, if he obeyed Allaah all of his affairs would have been good, his life and livelihood would have been pleasant, comfortable, pure, blessed and henceforth zikrullaah and holding fast to the obedience of Allaah, you will tread in steadfastness and goodness and comfort with the blessing of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala). This is the sixth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh is Zakaat (Charity) : As the Prophet said (reported by Hakim) : If they didn&#8217;t stop preventing from paying their zakaat of their monies except that the rain from the skies was prevented from them. And if it was not for the animals, rain wouldn&#8217;t have fallen upon them. It is a long hadith but this part of the hadith is the point of discussion. &#8216;That they did not prevent from paying their zakaat, of their monies, except that the water from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not have rained upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this hadith it is clear that if they prevent from giving their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. And if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not fall upon them at all. It does however rain on them &#8212; a mercy from Allaah due to the animals and due to the babies who are not responsible. Therefore not paying zakaat is a means of the prevention of rain from the sky. And if the rain is prevented from the sky, poverty takes place and torment and destruction over the people of the land. So fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of the properties, the apparent and the non-apparent, (the Daahir and the Baatin) &#8212; the non-apparent meaning the gold and the silver in jewellery and these other cash commodities in their different known currencies; and the apparent meaning the cows and sheep and camels and agricultural products. These things that are seen in front of the people. So it is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of his properties : apparent and non-apparent properties. Because zakaat is a pillar from the five pillars of Islaam. And Allaah had made the things that should be spent on in the 8 categories mentioned in surah at-Tawbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Read the ayah. He does not mention it in full. However, I will mention it. In the ayah sadaqaath here means zakaat. They are only for the fuqaraah and the masakeen, (which is a degree higher than a fakeer) and those employed to collect the funds, and to attract the hearts of those who have been attracted to Islaam, to free the captives, to free those in debts and for Allaah&#8217;s cause and for the wayfarer. A duty imposed upon Allaah and Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the people stopped paying their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. The correct statement from the people of knowledge that jewellery of women from gold and silver if it reaches the limits from where one pays the zakaat , then zakaat is upon it if it reaches that limit and one year has passed on that limit. Nasaab or the least amount on which the zakaat should be paid is 80g of gold and 400g from silver. So if the husband owns it, he gives the zakaat. And if the wife owns it she gives the zakaat which is obligatory every year. So, if it is less than 80g maybe 76g and she does not have cash properties then, it is not upon her to pay zakaat. However if it is 76g for instance and she has cash worth such and such grams, then she has to pay zakaat because she has from this cash what would make up for the deficiency in silver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : If people did not stop paying their zakaat, except that the rain from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals rain would not have fallen upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth door of sustenance : Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : Charitable donations, and nafaqaath (regular spending) – you spend on yourself, on your wife, on your children, on your father and your mother, your uncles and aunts, your righteous neighbours, on sons and daughters, relatives, widows and orphans – this type of charity, the affair of this is great with Allaah. This is a means of accumulation of provision, a door from the door of sustenance. And it has come in the saheehain from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah said : There is not a day that the slaves wake up in it .. everyday that the servant wakes up except that two angels come down and say : one of them says to the other &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that spends , give him something to replace it;&#8217; and he says to the other one : &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that holds back a type of destruction.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So try and not make a day pass from you from the days of Allaah except that you stretch your hand as much as it is your ability to do, even if it is a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said : &#8216;Fear Allaah even if it is with half a date.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says: &#8216;fa mai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin kharrai yara. Wamai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin sharrai yara&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;that whoever does an atoms worth of good he will see it. And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) also says, &#8216;whatever you spend in the way of Allaah, He will replace it and He is the best of the Providers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of &#8216;He will replace it?&#8217; i.e He will give you what is better than it. Don&#8217;t think that is the end and that it has gone from you. It will return to you with that which is better, insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : Whatever you have spent, then Allaah will replace it for you and He is the Best of Providers. And he says again that : O Allaah give the person that spends a replacement that is replaced for him with good, O Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that Msulim related that the Messenger of Allaah said : that there was people from people that were from before you a man who had a garden. And another man heard a cry from the sky, an angel from the clouds who said, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so.&#8217; So he poured into it some water into one of the irrigation holes and then the water ran into that garden. So the person who owned the garden, he had a shovel in his hand and he was fixing the water and fixing the dirt and this man said to the man who owned the garden, &#8216;may Allaah have mercy upon you. What is your name?&#8217;<br />
He said: I am so and so, the son of so and so. Then he said: &#8216;Why do you ask?&#8217;<br />
He said: &#8221; I hears a voice from the clouds saying, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so. May Allaah have mercy on you. What do you do with this?&#8217;<br />
So the owner of the garden says : &#8216;When I plant and then I harvest, I give one-third for me and my family and I take 1/3rd and I give it in charity. i.e I take 1/3rd and roll it back into my garden.<br />
Look at this. What is required from him is only a 10th of the farm that is if it comes from natural torrential streams and the like (without any artificial irrigation or water). And a half of the 10th if it is water with sprinklers and irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So rather than give one from 10 or ½ from 10, he gave from 3. Meaning he put aside more for charity. So see how Allaah singled him out with rain especially for his garden. Rain specific for him over his neighbours. What did he do to deserve this? He gave sadaqa. Therefore Sadaqaa doesn&#8217;t decrease wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were in a certain area giving dawah and alhamdulillaah we always go out calling the people to the Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and remind them of Allaah and the Last Day and righteous deeds and we saw that the mountains were green and the trees were green masha&#8217;Allaah and what a beautiful sight. And they had good agriculture. They must have had a good reason because their neighbour&#8217;s lands were dusty and barren and their land was green. We saw the reason on the way. There if you walk from a distance to a distance you could have the coolness of water i.e from place to place except that we saw a water cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Because of the water cooler, Allaah sent down rain because of this cooler. If they are generous people, then Allaah is more generous than them. He is generous and loves the generous people and if they are merciful, then Allaah is more merciful than them. Allaah is Merciful and He loves the merciful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sadaqa that they did, Allaah did not lose it for them. On the contrary, He gave them the reward for it in this world and the Hereafter. Therefore Sadaqa is a reason for the increase in provision and it is a door from the doors of sustenance and a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress – as-Sadaqa. And also az-Zakaat, it is a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress and all of what you have heard are doors from the doors of relief from distress –- a door of provision and a reason for provision. Even if some of the people only see the material means. As for these other legislated means then these are not in the minds of most people these days, except those on whom Allaah has mercy on. Even if they read the Qur&#8217;aan – however, without pondering, except whom Allaah has protected from that. We have eight now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth door is ad-Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) &#8212; Don&#8217;t forget ad-Du&#8217;aa O&#8217; Servants of Allah. Its affair is enormous. And your Lord said : &#8216;Call on me and I will answer you&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Du&#8217;aa is if you said something like :<br />
&#8216;Allahummar-ziqni&#8217; &#8212; O Allaah provide for me.<br />
Rizqan Halaalan&#8217; – a Halaal rizq.<br />
&#8216;Tayyiban&#8217; – pure<br />
&#8216;Mubarakan&#8217; &#8212; blessed<br />
&#8216;And make what you provided for us something a means of help – that would help us in your obedience.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah it is your rizq that is pure and halaal.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah make me be free with your halaal &#8212; from having to deal with anything that is haraam. To be free from needing anything except your bounty.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have supplicated to Allaah asking for good sustenance because he ordered you to supplicate.<br />
Allaah ordered you to supplicate and He has promised you that He will answer. And what do you think, du&#8217;aa is for something else and not for rizq? No, it is even for rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions from the supplications from His righteous slaves : &#8216;O Allaah give us in this world the good and in the Hereafter the good and save us from Fire.&#8217; – And from the good of the Dunya is halaal sustenance that helps you in the obedience of Allaah. And the Hadith of Anas in the saheehain that he said : &#8216;Every time the Prophet used to make dua, he used to make dua with this du&#8217;aa :<br />
Rabbana Aaathina fid-Dunyaa hasana wafil Aaakhirathi hasana wa kina azaabannaar.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this world and the good in the Hereafter and save us from the<br />
Hell-Fire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, du&#8217;aa its affair is great. So supplicate to your Lord to give you good sustenance and halaal provision and pure sustenance, blessed provision and beneficial sustenance and you should ask Him to satisfy you with halaal and not with haraam and to make you satisfied with His bounties and not in need of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to say in between the two sajdaas in salaah :<br />
Rabbigh firli warhamni, wajburni, ….<br />
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me and have mercy on me, make me firm, guide me, comfort me and sustain me.&#8217;<br />
Between the two sajdaas in every salaah and sometimes he would say<br />
&#8216;Rabbighfir lee, Rabbigh firlee.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me, O Allaah forgive me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how many hadiths with regard to seeking rizq or sustenance from Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and this is considered from the means as you have heard from the legislated means. So now we have nine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is al-Birr (The Righteous) – &#8216;Al-Birr al Waalidain&#8217; having piety towards the parents, its affair is great. And it is a door from the doors of relief from grief, and it is a door from the doors of rizq and it is a means from the means of rizq. Allaahu (azzawajal) says :<br />
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem. Wa innal fujjaara lafee jaheem.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Verily the (Abraar) the pious people are going to be in Paradise and the (Fujjaar) the wicked, evil doers will be in the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) mentions in his book &#8216;Madaarijus Saadiqeen&#8217; – the people who check the course &#8212; in the first volume that the one that thinks that Naeem and Jaheem i.e the Paradise and the Fire in this ayah will only be on the Day of Judgement, then he has misconstrued the ayah. The ayah is general. So the abraar are in Naeem&#8217; in the Dunya (worldly life), and the Barzaakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aaakhirah (Hereafter). And the Fujjaar – the wicked, evil doers are in Jaheem in the Dunya (worldly life), in the Barzaakh and in the Aakhirah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Naeem, the pleasantry of the Dunya is good provision, halaal provision, pure sustenance, that is a help for you to do righteous deeds. In that case, then be righteous to your parents and ya subhanAllaah. This is something that is tested and proven to be true. Just by if you did good to your parents and by being righteous to them, help them and ask from them du&#8217;aa except that Allaah will provide for you good and fast sustenance as the Prophet said in Saheeh al-Jaami : &#8216;there are two subjects whose punishments are made to come fast. Al-Baghi i.e infringement upon people&#8217;s rights and &#8216;uqooq&#8217; i.e being disobedient to the parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who infringes on the rights of the people, infringes on the rights of the people with oppression, infringes on the rights of the people by insult, infringes on their rights by striking physically, infringes on their rights with transgression and taking their money or striking their bodies or insulting their honour. This &#8216;baab&#8217; or affair &#8212; its punishment comes in this life and fast, i.e. before the Aakhirah and just like this &#8216;al-Uqooq&#8217; – disobedience to the parents. The punishment of disobedience to parents comes fast and the opposite is the same al-Birr and Adl and Insaaf. i.e justice / equity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insha-Allaah you will take the reward now and later. This is the developed understanding of the Hadith and the ayah:<br />
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem&#8221; – Verily the pious people or the people that are the righteous are in the Paradise. So there are &#8216;Naeem&#8217; in their Dunya and their Aakhirah. And from the Naeem is self-contentment. Even if what is in his position is minute. Allaah has given him &#8216;an-Naeem&#8217; in the dunya – he feels contentment with that. He is not like the one that was victim to bankruptcy, feels that he has nothing in his pocket – bankruptcy, he has a lot of burden, always thinking, always angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, the power of Imaan makes him content and comfortable. Allaah is the One who created me and He has been responsible for my sustenance. You have the Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Masood in the Saheehain and it has been mentioned in the 40 Hadith of Imaam Nawawi : Allaah creates the soul in the womb in the fourth month and in the fourth month he sends an angel to write four words : what his sustenance would be, what his work would be, when he would die and whether he would be happy or miserable.<br />
When you are in the stomach of your mother in the fourth month, when the spirit is blown in, this angel is ordered in the writing of these four things and from these is sustenance, how much provision you will get so you will live in the dunya, the measuring of what Allaah has written for you and your rizq in the dunya is the measuring of what Allaah measured for you of rizq and whether you are going to be happy or miserable, what is the appointed time for death and the reason &#8211;– so you walk on a path that Allaah has written for you Azzawajal, you walk on it with your choice because Allaah did not oppress anyone. As He said: &#8216;And I surely am not an oppressor for the servants.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Imaan : the believer in Allaah and the believer in His deen and Shariah, then she should do what is from Imaan – Imaan in al-Qadr &#8212; the good of it and the bad of it. And that Allaah has decreed his sustenance and that his endeavour does not speed up anything and his slowness doesn&#8217;t delay anything in this affair and that the affair is in the hands of Allaahu ta&#8217;ala. So what He wills it is and what He didn&#8217;t, it will not come out to anything. However it is this person who reads the Book of Allaah and ponders over the Book of Allaah and always reads the Sunnah of the Messenger (alaihissalaatu wassalam) and ponders always upom the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is Material Means : The Sheikh says from those means are those material means like for instance being a farmer, a merchant or a manufacturer – any means from the material means as long as you don&#8217;t destroy yourself. You were not created for the purpose of the Dunya. Whether you were created for the purpose of Allaah (azzawajal) i.e for the purpose of worship and the most important thing is satisfaction and continence, i.e self-control with regards to passions and seeking self-sufficiency from Allaah and satisfaction in Him. And you know that some people only have a motor and Allaah made his sustenance from that –&#8211; the sustenance of his family, that one motor. And some of them a donkey, and some people from villages have only one donkey and he spends from that for his whole family. Some a camel, some an ox &#8212;- he tilts for the people and supports the family. And for some of them an electric tool, or pliers and support from this a whole family. Some of them have 3, 4, 5, items in his possessions, he sells and spends on his family. And others have miswaak and he spends on his family. And another has perfume of antimony (khul) and he spends on his family. So it is more a means that you work by. As you would say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Allaah this is the dua and it is upon You to answer it.&#8217;<br />
In the same way you say : &#8216;O Allaah this is the means and it is upon You to provide for me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You don&#8217;t depend upon the means. Because if you depend upon the means and only the means then you would have depended or put your trust in other than Allaah &#8212; and this is not permissible. This is a mere means. If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah ordered us to take towards the means, we would have not taken towards it. However, it is an order of Allaah and look at Maryam (alaihissalam) while she was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says to her :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this state of pregnancy while being weak and with that He still said : &#8216;Shake the trunk of the date palm towards you.&#8217; There must be working by the means. Work by the means. We are not dervishes &#8212; people that do nothing. We are Muslims and people of daleel and people of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. We work by the means &#8212; in a safe correct means that which does not come in conflict with the deen. i.e. the means is not something unlegislated by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One person who might say, &#8216;we steal&#8217; and this is a means. The other may say, &#8216;we fornicate&#8217; and this is a means. Another sells intoxicants and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; These means are unlegislated, forbidden. Or asks for bribes or robs or plunders and says &#8216;this is a means&#8217; or cheats and deceives and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; No, there must be with regards to the means that they have to be legislated from what Allaah has made halaal, not being any disobedience in it, not having any opposition to the deen of Allaah. He mentioned the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;<br />
(Even though Allah has informed us thus).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sheikh reiterates that every time he entered the mihrab &#8212; the praying place of the private room, he found her supplied with sustenance even though Allaah told us this about her. He found with her sustenance. He (Zakariya) said : O Maryam, from where did you get this?<br />
She said : From Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills without limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at that time zakariyya invoked his Lord. If you work with the legislated, trusted means, you are trusting in Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and by Allaah your rizq will come to you, no doubt. And I have put forward for you examples and Allaah puts forward parables for the people so they can reflect. I said to you : a person spends on his family by selling &#8216;miswaak and that one spends on his family by being a seller of oil, and that one a seller of ghee and that one a seller of honey and that one is a seller of wheat. He sells wheat and that one is a &#8216;bazzaar&#8217; and he sells seeds. The books of biographies are filled with this, that of our pious predecessors. And that one is &#8216;al-Kayyaal&#8217; &#8212; he has a scale and he weighs things for people and they pay him and that one fixes shoes, nails it and ties it. Up until now all what I mentioned is present and it is a sign from the signs of Allaah and ar-Razzaaq, He is Allaah (azzawajal) and you may very well find that a person who fixes shoes is in a state of self-contentment than a big merchant and a big manager. Or a &#8216;sayy aathi&#8217; &#8212;- the one who fixes watches and sells watches. You may very well find him in a state of contentment. He has 4 watches in his possessions and he sells it, goes home and is comfortable. You may not find this self-contentment with a merchant or a big manager. Each one of them &#8212; his head is filled with problems and he doesn&#8217;t find comfort in his sleep and is not patient, and is not resting. Everything is preoccupation and stress and a lot of them become victims to diabetes, cancer and asthma. The other one is comfortable i.e the one who sells honey, wheat, watches etc. He is content with himself. He is not concerned with taxes or he is not concerned with the rent of a store or show room. And the most important thing is self-contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh door to the doors of sustenance is Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : Holding fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah is considered one of the doors from the doors of sustenance. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) said about the people of the Book : &#8216;that only if they had established the Toraah and the Injeel (what was revealed to them from their Lord) they would have eaten from above them and from under their feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so for the one who holds onto the Tauraat and the Injeel. Then for the one who holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah this the given priority because the Book and the Sunnah is better than the heavenly books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then we have mentioned 12 doors and means from the means of rizq and from this 11 are spiritual and one was physical or material. Material means we mentioned that we should do work that is halaal, not to waste the time of salaah, he sells or buys or manufactures We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mentioned the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever likes that his rizq is widened for him and his life is expanded then he should join family ties. Joining the ties is increase in one&#8217;s rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Hadith of Anas : There used to be 2 brothers at the time of the Messenger and one of them used to work to earn a living and the other one used to go and seek knowledge from the Prophet and he used to worship Allaah. So the one who earned a living complained about his brother to the Prophet and so the Prophet said : &#8216;May be you are giving sustenance to him. i.e may be Allaah made your sustenance plentiful because of you spending upon your brother.&#8217; So the sheikh reiterated saying: maybe you are given rizq because of him. And he said that this might enter under the category of spending on the student on knowledge. So one of the ways of joining ties of relationships is to spend. With this the Sheikh ends the remainder some of the many means of attaining sustenance and getting relief from distress. Wa sallaahu ala nabee ina Muhammad wa &#8216;ala Aaalihi wasahbihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I finally advice myself and you with the taqwa of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to hold fast to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger . May Allaah give us all tawfeeq and He affirms us on His deen and makes us upon the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>May Allaah reward the sister who Transcribed from the Audio </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Author:Imaam Muhammad </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
</strong>Source:Al-Asaalah (Issue #6) [E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee]<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> What is the religious ruling concerning buying in installments?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Answer:</strong> First of all, buying in installments is an innovation of the actions that was not known to the Muslims in every preceding generation. Rather it is from the aspects that have been passed onto them from the disbelievers, those who, in the past, took over their lands, colonized them and governed over them with their rules of disbelief. Then when they departed from the lands&#8217; major districts, they left behind their evil and misguided traditions. And, today, the Muslims live upon those practices and acts that the disbelievers imposed on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another concern – which is the most important – and it is as the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;I have not left anything that would bring you closer to Allaah, except that I have commanded you to do it. And I have not left anything that would distance you from Allaah, while bringing you closer to the Hellfire, except that I have forbidden you from doing it.&#8221;</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we see that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade from that which today is called <strong>&#8220;buying in installments.&#8221;</strong> Therefore, this kind of business transaction is an innovation, which the Muslims of the past did not know of. I also want to say that this name is an innovation (in itself) for there is nothing found in the books of Fiqh with the name &#8220;buying in installments.&#8221; Rather, there is found in the Muslim books, that which is called <em>Ad-Dain</em> (debt) and that which is called <em>Al-Qard-ul-Hasan</em> (a goodly loan). This (latter) has become, in the daily affairs of Muslims, just a name without any form and reality to it. This is in spite of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) incitement towards giving goodly loans and his going to great extents in that, to the extent that he regarded the lending of two dollars to be as if you gave one dollar away in charity. This means: If you lend your Muslim brother two dollars, it is as if you have taken a dollar out of your pocket and given it for charity. Just as he (peace be upon him) encouraged these goodly loans, he forbade from taking extra money in exchange for delaying your brother&#8217;s payment of his end of the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> And in another hadeeth, he <strong>&#8220;forbade that two business transactions be made for one (transaction).&#8221;</strong> The reporter of this hadeeth was asked about the meaning of this forbiddance, so he responded: &#8220;It is that you say: &#8216;I will sell you this thing for such and such amount of money in cash, and for such and such (more) money in delayed payment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will sell you this appliance for 100 dollars in cash directly, and for 105 dollars in installments, meaning as a debt. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> This means that if he takes the exra money, then it is interest, as is seen in the example of the appliance that was sold for 105 dollars, five dollars more in exchange for the delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were an Islaamic rule for individuals and rulers, this buyer who was deceived and had five extra dollars taken from him in exchange for the businessman&#8217;s waiting on the delay, he would have the right to take hold of him and complain about him to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the understanding of this hadeeth. The thing being sold is one, however the offer is in two transactions: In cash directly for this amount and in delayed payment for that amount. So the increase of money for the delay in paying at once was labeled as interest by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The first type of craving for wealth is that a person has extreme love for wealth and also relentlessly exerts efforts to attain it &#8211; via means which are lawful &#8211; being excessive in that, striving hard and making painstaking efforts and toiling in order to attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that this hadeeth was in response to the appearance of some elements of th is, as at-Tabaraanee reports from `Aasim ibn `Adiyy, radiyallaahu `anhu, who said, `I bought a hundred shares from the shares of Khaybar and that reached the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam so he said, <b>&#8220;Two ravenous wolves remaining amongst sheep whose owner has lost them will not be more harmful than a Muslim`s seeking after wealth and status is to his Deen.”</b> [It is quoted by al-Haithumee in Majma` uz-Zawaa`id (10/250) and he attributed it to at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat and said, &#8220;Its isnaad is hasan (good).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more to chasing after wealth than the wastage of a person&#8217;s noble life for that which has no value. Instead he could have earned a high rank (in Paradise) and everlasting bliss, but he lost this due to his craving after provision &#8211; which had already been assured to him and allotted to him, and it was not possible for anything to come to him except what was decreed for him &#8211; then on top of this he does not benefit from that, but rather abandons it and leaves it for someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He departs from that and leaves it behind so that he will be the one held accountable for it, yet someone else benefits from it. So in reality he is only gathering it for someone who will not praise him for that, whilst he himself goes on to One who will not excuse him for that &#8211; this itself would indeed be enough to show the blameworthiness of this craving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who has this craving wastes his valuable time and engages himself in that which is of no benefit to himself &#8211; in journeying and exposing himself to dangers in order to amass that which will only benefit someone else, so it is as is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So one who spends his days in gathering wealth<br />
Out of fear of poverty &#8211; then he has achieved only poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to a wise man, &#8220;So and so has amassed wealth,&#8221; so he said, &#8220;Then has he amassed days in which to spend it?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Then he has amassed nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also said in some narrations from the People of the Book, &#8220;Provision has already been allotted and the one greedy for wealth is deprived. Son of Aadam! If you spend your life in seeking after this world then when will you seek after the Hereafter?&#8221; &#8220;If you are unable to do good deeds in this world, then what will you do on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas`ood, radiyallaahu `anhumaa, said, &#8220;Certain faith (yaqeen) is that you do not make the people happy by angering Allaah, and that you do not envy anyone for that which Allaah has provided, and that you do not blame anyone for something which Allaah has not given you &#8211; since provision will not be brought on by a person&#8217;s craving after it, nor will it be repelled by a person&#8217;s disliking it. Indeed Allaah through His Justice has made joy and happiness dependant upon having certain faith and contentment, and He has made worries and sorrow spring from doubt and displeasure.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf (predecessors) said: &#8220;Since predecree (qadr) is a reality then craving is futile. Since treachery exists in people&#8217;s characters then trusting everybody is to expose oneself to humiliation. Since death awaits everybody, then being satisfied with this world is foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Zayd (from the successors of the Taabi`een of Basrah, died after 150H) used to swear by Allaah that a person&#8217;s craving after this world was more fearful to him than his worst enemy. He also used to say, “O my brothers! Do not grow up craving after his riches and increase in earnings or wealth, rather look upon him with the eye of one who detests that he is preoccupying himself with that which will cause his ruin tomorrow in the Place of Return &#8211; and is proud with that.&#8221; He also used to say, &#8220;Craving is of two types: Craving which is an affliction and craving which is beneficial. As for the craving which is beneficial, then it is one&#8217;s desire for that which is obedience to Allaah, and as for the craving which is an affliction then it is a person&#8217;s craving after this world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Craving after this world torments a person, he is preoccupied and does not attain joy or pleasure whilst amassing &#8211; since he is preoccupied. He does not find time &#8211; due to his love of this world – for the Hereafter, and is preoccupied with that which will perish and forgets that which will abide and remain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard a person said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not envy a brother who craves after riches –<br />
rather look upon him with aversion.<br />
Indeed the one who craves is preoccupied with his<br />
wealth from having any happiness due to his belongings.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone else said in this regard:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O gatherer and miserly one being watched closely by time<br />
which is wondering which of its doors it should close.<br />
You have gathered wealth, but think have you gathered for it &#8211;<br />
O gatherer of wealth &#8211; days in which you can spend it.<br />
Wealth is hoarded away with you for those who will inherit it &#8211;<br />
The wealth is not yours except on the day when you spend it.<br />
Satisfaction is for the one who settles in its neighbourhood<br />
And in its shade he finds no worries to disturb him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise person wrote to a brother of his who desired this world: &#8220;To proceed, you have become one who craves after this world. It will serve you whilst taking you away from it with accidents, illnesses, calamities and infirmity. It is as if you have not seen one who craves prevented from what he desires, nor one who shuns this world granted provision, nor one who died despite having great wealth, nor one who is fully satisfied in this world with a small amount.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A desert Arab rebuked a brother of his for covetousness, saying, &#8220;O my brother you are a seeker and one sought. You are being sought by One whom you cannot escape, and you are seeking that for which you have been sufficed. O brother, it is as if you have not seen one who craves being prevented, nor one who shuns the world being granted provision.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man said, &#8220;The people who have the greatest degree of restlessness are the envious, those who have the greatest degree of happiness are the contented. Those who persevere most through suffering are those who are covetous. Those who have the simplest and most pleasant life are those who most strongly refuse this world. The one who will suffer the greatest regret is the scholar whose actions contradict his knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of craving after wealth is that in addition to what has been mentioned in the first type, he also seeks wealth through unlawful means and withholds people&#8217;s rights &#8211; then this is definitely blameworthy greed and covetousness. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever is saved from his covetousness, such are those who are successful.” [Soorah al-Hashr (59):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Sunan Abee Daawood from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, from the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that he said, &#8220;Beware of greed (avarice) for indeed greed (avarice) destroyed those who came before you. It ordered them to cut off ties of relationship so they cut off ties of relationship, and it ordered them to be miserly so they were miserly, and it ordered them to commit sins so they committed sins.&#8221; [Reported by Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.2, p.445, no.1694), and al-Haakim (1/415) who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and Ahmad reports it (2/159, 195) with similar wording. I (Badr `Abdullah al-Badr) say: Its isnaad is saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim from Jaabir, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, that the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said, &#8220;Beware of greed (avarice), since greed (avarice) destroyed those who came before you. It led them to shed their blood and make lawful what was forbidden for them.&#8221; [Reported by Muslim (transl. vol.4, p.1366, no. 6248) and others, an-Nawawee said in explanation of the hadeeth, &#8220;al-Qaadee `Iyaad said: It is possible that this destruction was the destruction of those whose blood was spilled who were mentioned here, and it is possible that it is destruction in the Hereafter &#8211; and this is more apparent, and it is possible that it means destruction in both this world and the Hereafter. A number of people have said that avarice/greed (<i>shuhh</i>) is more severe than miserliness (<i>bukhl</i>) and causes the person to withhold to a greater degree. Some say that it is miserliness combined with covetousness. Some say that miserliness is with reference to specific actions whereas avarice/greed is general. Some say that miserliness is in particular actions and avarice/greed is with reference to wealth and good actions. Others say that avarice/greed is desiring that which one does not possess and being miserly about what one does possess.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars say, &#8220;Avarice is eager craving which causes a person to take things which are not lawful for him, and to withhold the rights of others. Its reality is that a person craves that which Allaah has forbidden and prohibited him from, and that one is not contented with the wealth and womenfolk and whatever else Allaah has made lawful for him. So Allaah, the Most High, has made lawful for us that which is good from foods, drinks, clothing and women and has forbidden us to acquire these things except by lawful means and He made lawful for us the blood and wealth of the Unbelievers and those fighting against us. He also forbade us from everything impure from foods, drinks, clothing and women, and He forbade us from seizing people&#8217;s wealth and spilling their blood unjustly. So he who limits himself to that which is permitted for him is a Believer, and one who goes beyond that into what he has been forbidden &#8211; then this is blameworthy avarice which is inconsistent with <i>Eemaan</i> (true faith in belief, word and action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam informed that avarice causes a person to cut off relations, commit sins and to be miserly &#8211; and miserliness is a person&#8217;s clinging on greedily to what he has in his hand. Whereas avarice is seeking to obtain that which does not belong to him unjustly and wrongfully &#8211; whether it is wealth or something else. It is even said that it is the head of all sins &#8211; this was how Ibn Mas`ood, radiyallaahu `anhu, and others from the Salaf explained avarice and greed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this the meaning of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurairah, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, will be understood. He reports that the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said, &#8220;Avarice (<i>shuhh</i>) and <i>Eemaan</i> will not combine in the heart of a Believer.&#8221; [This is part of a hadeeth whose wording is, &#8220;Dust in the way of Allaah and the smoke of Hell-Fire will never combine in the belly of a servant, nor will avarice and Eemaan ever combine in the heart of a servant.&#8221; It is reported by Ibn Abee Shaibah (5/344), Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (6/13,14)&#8230; and its chain of narration is hasan lighairihi (good due to supports).] Also in another hadeeth from the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam he said &#8220;The best of <i> Eemaan</i> is self-restraint (<i>sabr</i>) and compliance/liberality (<i>musaamahah</i>).&#8221; [This hadeeth has been reported from four Companions: (i) `Umayr ibn Qataadah al-Laythee, by al-Bukhaaree in at-Taareekhul-Kabeer (3/2/530) and al-Haakim (3/ 626), (ii) Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah &#8211; by Ibn Abee Shaibah in al-Eemaan (no.43) and Ibn Hibbaan in al-Majrooheen (3/136), (iii) `Amr ibn `Abasah &#8211; by Ahmad (4/375) and (iv) `Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit &#8211; by Ahmad (5/319), and the hadeeth is saheeh due to these chains &#8211; and Allaah knows best.] <i>Sabr</i> here has been explained to be withholding oneself from forbidden things, and <i>musaamahah</i> as the carrying out of the obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the word <i>shuhh</i> (avarice) may sometimes be used to mean <i>bukhl</i> (miserliness) and vice-versa, however in origin they are different in meaning, as we have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the person&#8217;s craving after wealth reaches this level then the deficiency it causes in a person&#8217;s Religion is clear &#8211; since failing to fulfill what is obligatory and falling into what is forbidden reduce one&#8217;s Religion and <i> Eemaan</i> without a doubt to the point that nothing but a little remains of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Examples of <a title="Biography of Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbaad (hafidhahullah)" href="http://scholars-biographies.com/2013/08/15/biography-of-shaykh-abdul-muhsin-al-abbaad-hafidhahullah/" target="_blank">Shaykh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbaad</a>&#8216;s Piety:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh served as president of the Islamic University of Madeenah, he didn’t abuse his position and take it as an opportunity to oppress the workers and employees. Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree relates: “I went to the University at the time of ‘Asr when Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin served as its president. And there would be no one in the University except for him and me. So I said to him: ‘Why don’t you bring someone who will open the University for you before you come?’ He replied: ‘I will not make anybody work at this time because it is a time of rest.’ This was at the time of ‘Asr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One graduate from the University related that when the Shaikh was president there he would not like to stop the university car on the road to buy things for the house. Meaning: Since the car was just to take him to and from work, he would not like to abuse this by using it for personal reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion, when his term of presidency ended, his driver saw him standing on the street waiting, so he passed by him as usual and offered to take him home, but he replied: “I wouldn’t think of it. My term as president has ended and I called my son to come and get me.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: What is the islamic ruling on someone who works in the <strong>public sector</strong>, although we all know that most of the money of the government is the produce of usurious dealings and alcohol selling. Is it lawful to have a government job? Civil workers seek to benefit their family from the <strong>pension they receive after he dies</strong> as no pension is provided for freelance working. We live in a country where there is <strong>no Bayt-ul-Mal (Muslim treasury)</strong><span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1La" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is nothing wrong in working in a non-Muslim country as long as the kind of work done does not involve disobeying or helping to disobey Allah. There is nothing wrong with you receiving your salary from the mixed treasury of the state<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1La" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span> May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</strong></span></p>

The third question of Fatwa no. 5488</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Regarding the asl of pention</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: I was enrolled in the Egyptian Armed Forces as a volunteer from September 1967 A.D. till January of 1981 A.D., and served in the Army for approximately thirteen years. They used to deduct part of my monthly salary to cover insurance and pensions. This was obligatory. After Allah guided me to understand Islam, I resigned, and thanks to Allah, my resignation was accepted. However, they started paying me 56.54 pounds as a </span><strong style="color:#993300;">monthly pension</strong><span style="color:#993300;">. A brother told me that the money of this pension is </span><strong style="color:#993300;">Riba (usury)</strong><span style="color:#993300;"> and that I must refuse it. Is this correct? What is the correct ruling concerning this pension?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">A: If the reality is as you mentioned, it is permissible for you to take the retirement pension as it is a reward for the period you served in the government.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’<br />
By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by <a href="http://followingthesunnah.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/the-encouragement-in-islaam-to-utilize-the-land-to-till-the-land/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abbas Abu Yahya</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are many Ahadeeth regarding this, I will mention a few of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From Anas the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008000;">‘There is no Muslim who plants a plant or a tree, or sows a seed and no bird, or human or animal eats from that except that it is a charity for that person.’</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari, Muslim &amp; Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Jabir from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘There is no Muslim who plants a plant or a tree, except that whatever is eaten from it is a charity for him.  Whatever is stolen from that is a charity for him.  Whatever is eaten from it by an animal is a charity for him.  Whatever a bird eats is a charity for him, no one suffers a loss except that it will be a charity for him till the Day of Judgement.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 9 – From Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘If the final hour comes and one of you has a small date-palm plant in his hand, and if you can plant it before you stand then plant it.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Imam Bukhari brought a chapter heading in the previous book (<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#000000;">al-Adab al-Mufrad</span></span>) for this Hadeeth, where he said: ‘Chapter: The Production of Wealth’ then he narrated from al-Harith bin Laqeett who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There used to be a man from amongst us who would get his horse to reproduce, and then slaughter it. And he would say: ‘Why should I live so that I ride this thing? [i.e. The Day of Judgement is very close].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a letter came to us from Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You should cultivate and prosper with that which Allaah has provided you, since indeed in this regard there is enough time.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari also narrated from Dawood with an authentic chain, who said: Abdullaah bin Sallam said to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘If you hear that the <em>Dajjal</em> has exited and you are about to plant a small tree, then do not delay tending to cultivating it, because the people will have a sustenance from that later.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Jareer narrated from ‘Amaarah bin Khuzaimah bin Thaabit who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘I heard Umar bin al-Khattab say to my father: ‘What prevents you from tilling your land?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">My father replied to him: ‘I am an old man and I may die tomorrow.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So Umar said to him:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘I swear that; indeed you must plant on your land.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Indeed I saw Umar bin al-Khattab plant a plant or tree with his own hands along with my father.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Jamia’ al-Kabeer’ by Suyootee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why some of the Companions used to regard a man who works on his land as a worker from the workers of Allaah – Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari narrated in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’ from Nafi’ bin ‘Aasim that he heard Abdullaah bin ‘Amr say to his nephew, when he was coming out of his [<em>al-Waha</em>] farm: ‘Are your workers doing their jobs?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: ‘I do not know.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah said: ‘As for me, if I was skilled and trained I would learn the job your workers do.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he turned towards us and said: ‘Indeed if a person works along his workers in his home [and the narrator once mentioned: ‘with his wealth’]; then that person would be a worker from the workers of Allaah – Azza wa Jal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is ‘Hasan’ InshAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>al-Waha</em>’ in the Arabic  language means: a garden, and it was a very large piece of land which was owned by ‘Amr bin ‘al-Aaas in Taif about three miles from Wajja, and it seems he left it for his children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Aasakir collected in his book ‘Tareekh’ with an authentic chain from ‘Amr bin Dinar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr bin al-Aaas entered a farm which he owned in Taif which was called <em>al-Waha</em>, it had a million stakes of wood [which were used to prop up the grapes], he had bought every stake of wood for a <em>Dirham</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the general benefits from those Ahadeeth from the Salaf as-Salih <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari wrote a chapter heading in his ‘Saheeh’ for the first two Ahadeeth by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Chapter: The excellence of growing plants if they are eaten from’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol. 1 hadeeth no 7-9 p.37-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his  guidance</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sulaiman Al-Rajhi’s life a rags to riches story</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saudi Arabia’s rags-to-riches billionaire <strong><span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-18l" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">Sulaiman Al-Rajhi</span></a></span> is also a world-renowned philanthropist.</strong> He is the founder of Al-Rajhi Bank, the largest Islamic bank in the world, and one of the largest companies in Saudi Arabia. As of 2011, his wealth was estimated by Forbes to be $7.7 billion, making him the 120th richest person in the world. His flagship SAAR Foundation is a leading charity organization in the Kingdom. The Al-Rajhi family is considered as one of the Kingdom’s wealthiest non-royals, and among the world’s leading philanthropists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi is a billionaire who <strong>chose last year to become a poor man at his own will without having any cash or real estates or stocks that he owned earlier.</strong> He became penniless after transferring all his assets among his children and set aside the rest for endowments. In recognition of his outstanding work to serve Islam, including his role in establishing the world’s largest Islamic bank and his regular contribution toward humanitarian efforts to fight poverty, Al-Rajhi was chosen for this year’s prestigious King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an interview with Muhammad Al-Harbi of Al-Eqtisadiah business daily, Al-Rajhi speaks about how he was able to succeed in convincing chiefs of the leading central banks in the world, <strong><span style="color:#002060;">including that of the Bank of England, nearly 30 years ago that interest is forbidden in both Islam and Christianity, </span><span style="color:#002060;">and that the Islamic banking is the most effective solution to activate Islamic financing in the world and make it a real boost to the global economy.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of Al-Rajhi is that of a man who made his fortunes from scratch, <strong>relying on grit and determination.</strong> Al-Rajhi threw away his huge wealth through two windows — distributed a major part of his inheritance among his children and transferred another portion to endowments, which are regarded as the largest endowment in the history of the Islamic world. He had to fight poverty and suffering during his childhood before <strong>becoming a billionaire through hard work and relentless efforts, and then leaving all his fortunes to become penniless again.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi is still very active and hardworking even in<strong> his 80s with youthful spirits</strong>. He begins his work daily <strong>after morning prayers and is active until Isha prayers before going to bed early.</strong> He is now fully concentrated on running the endowment project under his SAAR Foundation, and traveling various regions of the Kingdom managing activities related with it. He always carries a pocket diary containing his daily programs and activities and he is accustomed to stick on to the schedule he had prepared well in advance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi scored excellent performance results in almost all businesses in which he carved out a niche for himself. In addition to establishing the world’s largest Islamic bank, he founded the largest poultry farm in the Middle East.<strong> The credit of activating the organic farming experiment in the Kingdom mainly goes to him through launching a number of farming projects, including Al-Laith shrimp farming. He also established real estate and other investment projects.</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Excerpts</strong>:</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sheikh Suleiman, have you become a poor man again?<span id="more-4361"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes. Now I own only my dresses. I distributed my wealth among my children and set aside a portion for endowment to run charity projects. As far as I am concerned, this situation was not a strange one. My financial condition reached zero point two times in my life, and therefore I have had the feeling and understanding (about poverty) well. <strong><span style="color:#002060;">But now the feeling is accompanied by happiness, relaxation and the peace of mind. </span><span style="color:#7030a0;">The zero phase in life this time is purely because of my own decision and choice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Why did you choose this path?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">All wealth belongs to Allah, and we are only those who are entrusted (by God) to take care of them</span></strong>. There were several reasons that prompted me to distribute the wealth and that resulted in performing this virtue. Most important among them is to <strong><span style="color:#002060;">foster brotherhood and love among my children and safeguard their harmonious relationship. This is more significant than any wealth in this life</span>. </strong>I was also keen not to be instrumental in wasting the precious time of courts in case of any differences of opinion among them with regard to partition of inheritance. There are several examples that everybody could see when children entered in dispute over wealth and that led to the collapse of companies. Nation has lost many large companies and their wealth that we could have been saved if we tackled the matter in a right manner. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Apart from this, every Muslim should work on some endowments that could benefit him in the life after death. Likewise, I prefer my children to work on developing wealth, which they inherit after my death, during my lifetime itself rather than I continue working to increase them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Are you getting enough free time after the distribution of wealth?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As earlier I am still working on developing endowments. I will donate and give alms from it until Allah takes over this trusted deposit. I have worked out a meticulous scheme for this endowment and developed it with the support of specialist consultants and agencies. This idea struck me long before. Usually people in the Islamic world set aside one-third <strong><span style="color:#002060;">or one-fourth of their wealth for endowment and that will be effective only after their death. But in my case, I decided to implement this decision in my lifetime itself.</span></strong> So I invited my children to Makkah during the end of Ramadan and presented the idea in front of them. They readily agreed it and then I distributed my wealth among my children in addition to setting aside a part of it for endowment. I sought the help of consultants to facilitate the procedures for <strong><span style="color:#002060;">the distribution of all my assets including properties, real estates and stocks, and that was completed in a cordial atmosphere. All my children are now fully satisfied with my initiative and they are now working on these properties in my lifetime.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>How much wealth you distributed among children and set aside for endowment?</strong></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He laughed without giving an answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How do you feel now about your projects?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to point out that there were some factors that prompted me to make investments in certain specific areas. My experiment in money exchange was the temptation to set up a bank. The absence of any Islamic banking was also another factor in establishing Al-Rajhi Bank, which is now the world&#8217;s biggest Islamic lender by market value. <strong>I began the experiment with opening an office in Britain where we introduced <span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-18l" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">Islamic banking system </span></a></span></strong>at a greater level. The experiment was a success and it had received total backing of the <strong>Saudi Islamic scholars at that time.</strong> I still recall the application made for getting license for the bank was turned down in the beginning. This was because the concerned British officials did not have any idea about Islamic banking. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Therefore, I went to London and met with the manager of the Bank of England and two of his deputies. I told them that Muslims and Christians see interest as forbidden (haram), and the Muslim and Christian religious people are unwilling to make transactions with banks based on interest and instead prefer to keep their cash and other valuables in boxes at their homes. </span></strong>I tried to convince them that (if we establish Islamic banks) this money would be helpful to strengthen the world economy. These talks were helpful in convincing them and they agreed to open Islamic banks. <strong>Then I traveled widely throughout the world in the West and East, and met with the chiefs of central banks in various countries and explained to them about the salient features of the Islamic economy.</strong> We started working and achieved success through launching it in the Kingdom and implementing it in London. <strong><span style="color:#002060;">When I returned to the Kingdom from London, I met the late Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz and Sheikh Abdullah bin Humaid, and informed them about the plan saying: &#8216;We would reach, by the grace of Allah, the Islamic banking within a stipulated period of time.&#8217; They praised me for the initiative. </span></strong>We started aggressively implementing the project and that is in the form of Al-Rajhi Bank as you see now. Regarding <strong>Al-Watania Poultry,</strong> the idea of establishing such a venture struck me after my visit to a poultry project abroad. I saw that the way of slaughtering chicken was not proper. Then I decided to make investments in the field of poultry after <strong>considering it as a duty to my religion and nation.</strong> I started the project even though making investments in poultry involved high risks in those days. Now Al-Watania has become a mega Saudi project that is instrumental in achieving food security in many respects. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">The company enjoys a 40 percent market share in the Kingdom, and Al-Watania chickens are naturally fed and halal slaughtered in accordance with the Shariah principles.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What about your insistence on introducing organic farming through Al-Watania agricultural projects?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you see, <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">now I am 85 and still enjoy good health. </span></strong>If we pursue organic farming as<strong><span style="color:#7030a0;"> our healthy food style, </span></strong>we can bring down cost of treatment to a great extent. We made several experiments in the field of organic farming. Our numerous experiments met with setbacks in the beginning. This prompted many engineers and workers to reach a conclusion that it is impossible to have organic farming and profit together. In the beginning, they were firm in their view that this would not at all be successful. But I insisted that it would work and continued compelling them to proceed with the venture. At one time, I took a firm position and told them<strong><span style="color:#002060;"> either to do organic farming or quit.</span></strong> Now we are reaping the fruits of this lucrative business in line with my vision to provide only the <strong><span style="color:#002060;">healthiest, safest and most trustworthy food to consumers. Al-Watania Agricultural Company stopped using chemicals and artificial fertilizers and focused exclusively on organic methods such as the use of pest insect repellants and animal manure.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Your austerity and thriftiness on spending are well known. Please comment?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am not a miser. But I am always vigilant against extravagance. I always try to impart this lesson to all those working with me whether it is in banking or poultry or other projects, and I am more concerned about it when it is coming to the case of my children. <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">In the past, I never gave money to my children when they were young in return for nothing. When any one of them approached me to give them cash, I asked them to do some work in exchange for it. In our life, we practice some extravagance without being aware of it. </span></strong>But it affects our whole life, exhausting us and putting a burden on our country. For example, there is no logic in putting heavy curtain on our windows and then lighting lamps in daytime when we get sunlight free of cost while electric lamps are costly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Despite all your wealth, why don&#8217;t you still have a private aircraft?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let me tell you that I have many planes but they belong to various airlines. I have ownership in all of them to the tune of the ticket fare that I pay for each travel. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">I always travel in economy class with the conviction that Allah bestowed us wealth not for showing arrogance or spend extravagantly but to deal with wealth as a trusted property.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What about the recreation and hobbies of Sheikh Al-Rajhi? How do you spend free time?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have not any special recreations. However, I find happiness and enjoyment while making a trip to the desert. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">I never went out of the Kingdom on a tourism trip.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What about your will? What are its salient features?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding my will related with wealth, I have already implemented it in my lifetime. As for the remaining aspect of my will, it is a public matter and also involves certain private matters, <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">besides encouraging my children to maintain their kinship and always reminding them about the life after death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How do you see your children&#8217;s private investments? Are there any directives to them?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of them are doing an excellent work in accordance with their knowledge and experience. Most often, I try to guide them when I noticed anything undesirable even if it is in their private investments. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Regarding my younger children, I always guide them, especially in the case of their investments</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">This is purely out of my keenness that they should be honest in their work as well as in spending wealth given by God as a trusted property.</span></strong> I am also eager to hear about my children that they are interacting with the society in the best possible manner, <strong><span style="color:#002060;">and that they are serving their religion and nation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In what way you like to spend your time? What are the places that you like most?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to travel between Riyadh, Qassim, Al-Jouf, and Al-Laith to oversee my projects there. I always prefer to visit the farms in Qassim and Al-Jouf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How could you preserve many old and precious things and antiques at Suleiman Al-Rajhi Museum?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A long time ago when I was in Jeddah, I was keen on preserving heritage pieces and gathered them together, especially those related with money exchange. There would be a history with every human being. The museum tells the story of money exchange. I particularly kept registers and cash boxes that were used when I started the money exchange business. The first cash box was made of wood, and there was a huge treasure box in which we kept our gold and silver. The artifacts kept at the museum tells the evolution of currency in the Kingdom through issuance of bank notes, as well as some currencies and coins that were in circulation among the Haj pilgrims. A major factor that prompted me to set up the museum was the visits made by a large number of officials from various countries to know more about these old coins and currencies. We have had to exhibit these rare collections in front of them to explain about our history and heritage, especially those related with money. I was keen to furnish the museum with historic and heritage pieces, especially with the same materials used for construction in the past. Hence, the roof of the museum was made of palm branches, and that was the case with the seating arrangements at the museum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Rajhi&#8217;s punctuality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The interview also sheds light on many qualities of Al-Rajhi, including his punctuality. &#8220;In the beginning of my business career, I had appointments with several top European company executives and officials. I still remember that I reached late for such an appointment due to an unavoidable reason. My delay was only a few minutes but the official excused himself for the interview. Later, after expansion of the projects, the same official came late for an interview with me so I excused myself for the interview. I always carry a paper to note down the schedule of meetings and stick to the schedule at any cost.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Al-Rajhi continued: I am always keen to strictly adhere to the Islamic principles throughout my life. </span></strong>Once I received an invitation from an Arab government to attend an investment conference there. On the sidelines of the conference, I was invited to take part in a dinner reception. When I reached there, I found a recreational program, which is contrary to our religious customs and traditions, taking place. <strong>So I quit the place immediately and, Abdul Aziz Al-Ghorair from the UAE also joined me.<span style="color:#002060;"> Soon minister plenipotentiary rushed to us, and we explained to him that the function is against our Islamic tradition. So he informed us that the recreational party would be cancelled. When they canceled that party, we participated in the dinner.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tackling crises</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi said: There was a huge fire that gutted down one of my factories managed by my son. When he came to inform me about it, I told him: Say praise be to God. I asked him not to submit any report about the losses to the authorities seeking compensation. <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">In fact, the compensation is from Allah and it is essential for us to be satisfied with What Allah destined for us.</span></strong> Assam Al-Hodaithy, financial director of Al-Watania Poultry, said: &#8220;When the fire broke out at the factory, we decided not to hurt Sheikh Al-Rajhi by informing about it at that moment. Later, when we met him next morning, he told us to shift the factory to another place and remove the debris until completion of reconstruction.&#8221; There was a similar fire at Al-Watania Poultry project in Egypt. The company incurred losses worth SR 10 million Egyptian pounds. When the concerned factory official contacted Al-Rajhi to inform about the fire, he was surprised to hear an instant reply from him: <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;AlHamdulillah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<a title="# The Great Enslavement : By Shaykh Sulaymaan as-Sulaymee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/great-enslavement/">The Great Enslavement</a> by Shaykh Sulaymân as-Sulaymî<br />
Source: <a title="Al-Istiqaamah Magazine" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank">Al-Istiqaamah</a>, Issue No.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone may ask: What is the proof that some people become slaves to money, or other similar things, and worship it? The proof is in the saying of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam where he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Woe be to the &#8216;abd (slave and worshipper) of the dirham, woe be to the &#8216;abd of the deenaar (dirham ond deenaar: equivilant to the Pound and the pence) &#8230;</span>&#8220;[3] Someone may ask: How does this enslavement to money manifest itself, and what is its nature! It is when the heart becomes so in love with money, that it covers up, or suppresses the love for Allaah, This love can reach such an extent that a person desires to attain this wealth by any means possible &#8211; neither caring whether the wealth comes to him through halaal (lawful) means; in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, or means that are haraam (unlawful and forbidden) in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So understand by reflection, that every single heart in all created things has feelings, desires and inclinations. It has the desire to love, to gain good and beneficial things for itself, it can feel fear and terror, and it can also surrender and become submissive. Thus, when its feelings, desires and inclinations are all directed to and for Allaah, then it is a heart that truly worships, submits and surrenders to Allaah alone. Therefore, it has khawf (fear) of only Allaah; it has rajaa (hope) in Allaah&#8217;s Mercy; it has mahabbah (love) for Allaah and whatever Allaah loves; and it has istislaam (submits and surrenders) to only Allaah. However, when these feelings, desires and inclinations are directed to other than Allaah, then it is a heart that is enslaved and worships that object which has captured and enslaved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbiddance of the heart submitting to other than Allaah should not be misunderstood to mean that Muslims must forsake the world and dealing with it. Rather, the true position of a Muslim is that which was with the Sahaabah (Companions) radiallaahu &#8216;anhum. They held the wealth in their hands, yet none of it was in their hearts. [About this, Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The position of wealth should be regarded like that of the toilet, in that there is need for it, but it has no place in the heart, and it is resorted to when needed.&#8221;</span>[4] The point being made is that we are not trying to call the people to the opinion of some of the Soofees, who believe that it is forbidden for a Muslim to possess wealth and take part in worldly transactions. Rather, it is obligatory for the Muslims to be the richest of people so that they may use this wealth as a means to worship Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; and to help people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of submitting and being enslaved to other than Allaah is when people submit and enslave their hearts to power and leadership. They are prepared for humiliation to take hold of them, and to abandon their scruples, in order to gain votes during elections; or other such similar situations. They are prepared to submit themselves to people &#8211; doing whatever is necessary for them to do &#8211; in order to win other people&#8217;s favour, and thus gain that vote or position. Thus, this is another form of submitting and enslaving one&#8217;s heart to other than Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">A) <strong>Hasan al Basri</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That a man complained to him concerning drought so it was said seek forgiveness from Allaah, another complained about another matter so it was said seek forgiveness from Allaah, another complained about lack of rain for his land so it was said seek forgiveness from Allaah another complained of no offspring so it was said seek forgiveness from Allaah, then he (Hasan al Basri) recited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">ٱسۡتَغۡفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمۡ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ غَفَّارٗا ١٠ يُرۡسِلِ ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيۡكُم مِّدۡرَارٗا ١١ وَيُمۡدِدۡكُم بِأَمۡوَٰلٖ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجۡعَل<br />
لَّكُمۡ جَنَّٰتٖ وَيَجۡعَل لَّكُمۡ أَنۡهَٰرٗا ١٢</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.</span> &gt;&gt; [Nuh: 10-12]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Taken from: ‘Fath al-Bari’ Chapter: the Best Method of Seeking forgiveness]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B) al-Hafidh Emaad ad-Deen Isma’eel <strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> (d. 774 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his Tafseer about the previous Ayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If you repented to Allaah and sought forgiveness from Him and showed obedience to Him your Rizq (provision) would increase and rain would fall from the blessings of the skies, and the blessings of the earth would spring forth, crops would grow for you. You will be given abundant livestock. You will be aided with wealth and offspring; meaning that offspring and wealth would be given to you. And you will be given gardens that have numerous types of fruits and through out there will be rivers that flow in these gardens. This is the way of giving Dawa’ by encouragement.’</p>
<p>[Taken from: ‘Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-Atheem’ 4/p.536]</p>
<p>C) It is narrated from <strong>Abi Saeed Al-Khudri</strong> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Whoever performs Wudu and then says:<br />
<span style="color:#993300;">‘ Subhanaka Allahuma wabihamdika la ilaha ila anta astaghfiruka wa atooboo ilaika’</span><br />
(‘Far are You O Allaah from imperfection, and You have all praise, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, I seek forgiveness from You and I repent to You),<br />
then this reward is written in a parchment and it is stamped with a seal and no falsehood can break it until the day of Judgment.’</p>
<p>[Taken from ‘Silsilah as-Saheehah’ No. 2333 declared Hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="font-size:large;">That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><br />
</strong>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &#8220;When this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),</em></span>) was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `<strong>O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan</strong>&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح» (<strong>Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.</strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger,&#8217; and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `<strong>Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.&#8217; He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too.</strong> Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!&#8217; She said, `Here I am.&#8217; He said, <strong>`Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#8217;</strong> She said, <strong>`<span style="color:#008000;">That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!</span>&#8216;</strong> She then transferred her goods and children.

<p style="text-align:justify;">«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Repenting from all sins but keeping the ill-gotten money</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 6: A person used to abandon Salah (prayer), drink alcohol and commit vile deeds. He has a lot of ill-gotten money. He then turned to Allah with sincere repentance with regard to all the sins mentioned above except the ill-gotten money. Should he get rid of such ill-gotten money? Or will he be treated like a new Muslim who is not asked about the source of his wealth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: on turning to Allah with sincere repentance with regards to the ill-gotten money, it is obligatory for one to get rid of such evil money. In case he is not able to define the ill-gotten money, he can give out what he thinks to clear himself from such guilt. This is to be followed if his sins have not caused him to leave Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On committing sins that make a person leave Islam such as the abandonment of Salah, according to the most preponderant opinion of scholars, even if such a person does not deny its obligation, repentance can be realized by performing Salah and embracing Islam again. This is because Islam wipes out all that has gone before it. <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Also, one is not obliged to get rid of the money he got before adopting Islam. This is because Allay (Exalted be He) says about the disbelievers, Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven</span></strong>. As mentioned in the Sahih (Authentic Book of Hadith), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). And penitence also wipes out all that has gone before it.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">He , the Sublime and Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But spend not wastefully ( your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift”  </strong></span>(al-Isra` 17:26 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Sublime, warns from <span style="color:#800000;"><strong>at-Tabdheer</strong></span> which is spending wealth on unlawful things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, spending wealth to oppress people or harm them, or spending it on oppressing one’s self such as spending it on intoxicants, narcotics, cigarettes, fornication and adultery, and the rest of the acts of disobedience, such as gambling and games of chance and the likes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also is the ruling of destroying it wealth without right such as excessive spending and purchasing products of which you have no need . this is from wasting wealth and from at-Tabdheer, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم ) has forbade wasting money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, at-Tabdheer is spending wealth in its incorrect ways, either acts of disobedience or on that which contains no benefit, out of play or neglecting money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">al-Israaf</span> </strong></span>then it is the excess, un-necessary spending.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example: a person eats and drinks extra food and drinks without need, such as if a kilo of food or a kilo of meat is enough for him but he adds more food or meat that he is not in need of. Consequently, the leftover food is thrown in the dirt or in the garbage; this is called Israaf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Destroying wealth without a just cause and wasting it is also called Tabdheer, He, the Sublime, has clarified that those who make Tabdheer are brothers of the devils because they inmate them in play, wasting and disobedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Said Imaam &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn &#8216;Abillah Ibn Baaz : </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221;Allah, the sublime and exalted, has sent down in His Grand Book many aayaat where wasting and extravagance is mentioned along with the prohibition of both, and the praise of those who adopt the middle course, and are moderate and Upright in their actions, eating, drinking and the rest of their spending. Therefore, there shouldn&#8217;t be any wastefulness, extravagance, miserliness, niggardliness, extremism, or negligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thusly Allah has ordained for the middle course to be adopted in all affairs oand from this is the prohibition of extremism.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawaa noor &#8216;ala adarb tape no321</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah extend your life! This is the questioner, Abu Abdullah, he says in the first question, If a person sees what amazes him, does he say Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah!), or Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah Laa Quwwata illah billah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah, there is no strength except with Allah) and are they all correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises are due to Allah, Lord of the worlds and prayer and salutation upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, his companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person sees that which amazes (pleases) him, pertaining to his wealth, then he should say <strong>Maashaa Allah Laa Quwwata illa billah</strong>, just as in the story of the companion of the two gardens, when his companion said to him: It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: That which Allah wills there is no power except with Allah. This is if he sees something amazing (pleasing) with his wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he sees it in other than himself then he should say <strong>Barakallahu Alaihi </strong>(May Allah bless it for him) or a statement similar to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he sees something that amazes (pleases) him from the matters of the Dunya (world) he should say: <strong>Labbaik, Innal Aish, Aishul Aakhirah</strong>, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam ) used to say. So he says Labbaik meaning an answer to you then he said verily the (real) life is the life of the hereafter. He makes it firm within himself at the same instance that the Dunya and whatever is within it does not remain and there is not any life in it but verily the real life is the life of the hereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We go through our entire lives looking for that perfect investment; whether it be our education, our jobs or our wealth. We put in so much time to gather information and to make sure that our investment will yield a satisfying return. In the end though, there is no certainty of the return on investment that we will gain, it could be 5%, 10%, or even -10%. We never know whether we will gain or lose from the investment that we make.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is an alternative. The alternative is investing in the deen of Allah. In this investment, you will never lose, and that is the promise of Allah . As we all know, Allah is the one who never breaks any promise and He is The One and Only that we can count on. So, when He promises something, you can consider it a done deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that gives (you) Want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return&#8221;. </span></strong>&#8211; [Surah Baqarah, 2:245]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir on the above ayah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:<br />
(Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it to him many times)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayah, Allah encourages His servants to spend in His cause. Allah mentioned this same Ayah in several other parts of His Glorious Qur&#8217;an. The Hadith that mentions that Allah descends (every night down on the nearest heaven to us when the last third of the night remains) states that Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Who would give a loan to He Who is neither poor nor unjust.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement:<br />
(He may multiply it to him many times), is similar to His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills.)</span> </strong>(2:261)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will mention this Ayah later on. Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And it is Allah that decreases or increases (your provisions), ) meaning, `Spend (in Allah&#8217;s cause) and do not be anxious.&#8217; Certainly, Allah is the Sustainer Who increases or decreases the provisions to whomever He wills among His servants. Allah&#8217;s wisdom is perfect, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and unto Him you shall return.) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">From Tafsir ibn Kathir (abridged. English Translation, published by Darussalaam) Vol 3. page 348:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basri (rahimahullah)said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whomever Allaah gives provision and he thinks that Allaah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allaah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.&#8221;  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited the Ayaah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</span> (Al-An&#8217;am 6:44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;By the Lord of the Ka&#8217;bah! Allaah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Haatim recorded this statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ad-Durr Al-Manthur 3:270, Ibn Abi Haatim 4:1291]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A burglar scaled the wall of Maalik bin Dinar&#8217;s house one night and easily managed to get inside. Once inside the house, the thief was disappointed to see that there was nothing inside actually worth stealing. The owner of the home was inside at the time, he was busy performing prayer. Realizing that he was not alone, Maalik quickly ended his prayer and turned around to face the thief. Without showing any sign of being shocked or afraid, Maalik calmly extended greetings of peace and then said, &#8220;My brother, may Allah forgive you. You entered my home and found nothing that is worth taking, yet I do not want you to leave my home without taking away some benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stood up, went to another part of the room, and came back with a jug full of water. He looked into the eyes of the burglar and said, &#8220;Make ablution and perform two units of prayer, for if you do so, you will leave my home with a greater treasure than you had initially sought when you entered it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Much humbled by Maalik&#8217;s manners and words, the thief said, &#8220;Yes, that is a generous offer indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After making ablution and performing two units of prayer, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, would you mind if I stayed for a while, for I want to stay to perform two more units of prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Stay for whatever amount of prayer Allah decrees for you to perform now.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thief ended up spending the entire night at Maalik&#8217;s house. He continued to pray until the morning. Then Maalik said, &#8220;Leave now and be good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But instead of leaving, the thief said, &#8220;Would you mind if I stayed here with you today, for I have made an intention to fast the day?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Stay as long as you wish,&#8221; said Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The burglar ended up staying for a number of days, praying during the late hours of each night and fasting throughout the duration of each day. When he finally decided to leave, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, I have made a firm resolve to repent for my sins and for my former way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Indeed, that is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man did mend his ways and began to lead a life of righteousness and obedience to Allah. Later on, He came across another burglar he knew. [His friend] said to him, &#8220;Have you found your treasure yet?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;My brother, what I found is Maalik bin Dinaar. I went to steal from him, but it was he who ended up stealing my heart. I have indeed repented to Allah, and I will remain at the door [of His Mercy and Forgiveness] until I achieve what his obedient, loving slaves have achieved.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir &#8211; Dar-us-salam &#8211; (Al-­Qasas, 76-84)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(76. Verily, Qarun was of Musa&#8217;s people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: &#8220;Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.&#8221;) (77. &#8220;But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world; and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Qarun and His People&#8217;s exhortation</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded that Ibn `Abbas said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ قَـرُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Qarun was of Musa&#8217;s people,) &#8220;He was the son of his paternal uncle.&#8221; This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal, Sammak bin Harb, Qatadah, Malik bin Dinar, Ibn Jurayj and others; they all said that he was the cousin of Musa, peace be upon him. Ibn Jurayj said: &#8220;He was Qarun bin Yashar bin Qahith, and Musa was the son of `Imran bin Qahith.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَءَاتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُوزِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We gave him of the treasures,) meaning, of wealth;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَآ إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوأُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُوْلِى الْقُوَّةِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men.) Groups of strong men would not have been able to carry them because they were so many. Al-A`mash narrated from Khaythamah, &#8220;The keys of Qarun&#8217;s treasure were made of leather, each key like a finger, and each key was for a separate storeroom. When he rode anywhere, the keys would be carried on sixty mules with white blazes on their foreheads and white feet.&#8221; Other views were also given, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لاَ تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Remember when his people said to him: &#8220;Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.&#8221;) means, the righteous ones among his people exhorted him. By way of sincere advice and guidance, they said: &#8220;Do not exult in what you have,&#8221; meaning, `do not be arrogant and proud of your wealth.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means, those who rejoice and gloat.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;It means those who are insolent and reckless, and do not thank Allah for what He has given them.&#8221; His saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَابْتَغِ فِيمَآ ءَاتَاكَ اللَّهُ الدَّارَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) means, `use this great wealth and immense blessing Allah has given you to worship your Lord and draw closer to Him by doing a variety of good deeds which will earn you reward in this world and the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) `That which Allah has permitted of food, drink, clothing, dwelling places and women. Your Lord has rights over you, your self has rights over you, your family has rights over you, and your visitors have rights over you. So give each of them their due.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَأَحْسِن كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, ) `Be generous to His creatures, as He has been generous to you.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ تَبْغِ الْفَسَادَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and seek not mischief in the land.) meaning: `do not let your aim be to spread corruption on earth and do harm to Allah&#8217;s creation.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً وَلاَ يُسْأَلُ عَن ذُنُوبِهِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(78. He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221; Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected But the criminals will not be questioned of their sins.)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us how Qarun responded to the exhortations of his people when they sought to guide him</h2>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221;) meaning, `I have no need of your advice; Allah has only given me this wealth because He knows that I deserve it and because He loves me. &#8216; In other words: `He has given it to me because He knows that I am fit for this.&#8217; This is like the Ayat:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَـهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When harm touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We have changed it into a favor from Us, he says: &#8220;Only because of knowledge I obtained it.&#8221;) (39:49) An alternative interpretation of this Ayah says that the meaning is: &#8220;Only because of what Allah knows about me did I obtain this favor.&#8221; This is like His saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَـذَا لِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is from me.&#8221;) (41:50) meaning, &#8220;I deserved it.&#8221; Imam `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam explained this Ayah very well. Concerning the phrase,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221;) He said: &#8220;Were it not for the fact that Allah is pleased with me and knows my virtue, He would not have given me this wealth.&#8221; And He said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected) This is what those who have little knowledge say when they see a person whom Allah has granted a lot of wealth; they say that if he did not deserve it, Allah would not have given it to him.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿فَخَرَجَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ فِى زِينَتِهِ قَالَ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَلاَ يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ الصَّـبِرُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(79. So, he went forth before his people in his finery. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: &#8220;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8221;) (80. But those who had been given knowledge said: &#8220;Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except the patient.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">How Qarun went forth in His Finery, and His People&#8217;s Comments</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us how Qarun went forth one day before his people with his magnificent regalia; wearing his fine clothes, accompanied by his fine horses, his servants and retinue. When those whose desires and inclinations were for the world saw his adornments and splendor, they wished that they could have the same as he had been given, and said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.) meaning, `he is very lucky and has a great share in this world.&#8217; When the people of beneficial knowledge heard this, they said to them:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds,) `Allah&#8217;s reward to His believing, righteous servants in the Hereafter is better than what you see,&#8217; as is reported in the authentic Hadith:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ وَاقْرَءُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has prepared for His righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and the heart of a human cannot comprehend. Recite, if you wish: (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.)) (32:17).</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ الصَّـبِرُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and this none shall attain except the patient.) As-Suddi said: &#8220;None shall reach Paradise except for the patient&#8221; &#8212; as if this were the completion of the statement made by the people of knowledge. Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;This applies only to those who patiently forsake the love of this world, seeking the Hereafter. It is as if this is part of what the people of knowledge said, but it is made part of the Words of Allah, stating this fact.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿فَخَسَفْنَا بِهِ وَبِدَارِهِ الاٌّرْضَ فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنتَصِرِينَ &#8211; وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِالاٌّمْسِ يَقُولُونَ وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ لَوْلا أَن مَّنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(81. So, We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) (82. And those who desired his position the day before, began to say: &#8220;Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants. Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">How Qarun and His Dwelling Place were swallowed up by the Earth</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After telling us about Qarun&#8217;s conceit and pride in his adornments, and how he was arrogant towards his people and transgressed against them, Allah then tells us how he and his dwelling place were swallowed up by the earth. This was also reported in the Sahih by Al-Bukhari from Salim, who said that his father told him that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ يَجُرُّ إِزَارَهُ إِذْ خُسِفَ بِهِ، فَهُوَ يَتَجَلْجَلُ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(While a man was dragging his lower garment, he was swallowed up and he will remain sinking down into the earth until the Day of Resurrection.) He also recorded something similar from Salim from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet . Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ فِيمَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ خَرَجَ فِي بُرْدَيْنِ أَخْضَرَيْنِ يَخْتَالُ فِيهِمَا، أَمَرَ اللهُ الْأَرْضَ فَأَخَذَتْهُ، فَإِنَّهُ لَيَتَجَلْجَلُ فِيهَا إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When a man among the people who came before you went out wearing two green garments, walking proudly and arrogantly, Allah commanded the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking down into it until the Day of Resurrection.) This version was recorded only by Ahmad, and its chain of narration is Hasan (sound).</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنتَصِرِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) means, his wealth, group, servants and retinue were of no avail to him; they could not protect him from the wrath and vengeance of Allah. Nor could he help himself or save himself. There was no one to help him, neither himself nor anybody else.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">His People learned a Lesson from Him being swallowed up</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِالاٌّمْسِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who had desired his position the day before,) means, those witnessed him with his finery and said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: &#8220;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8221;) When he was swallowed up in the earth, they began to say:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants.) Wealth does not indicate that Allah is pleased with its owner, for Allah gives and withholds, allows times of difficulty and times of ease, raises and lowers, His is the most complete wisdom and most convincing proof. According to a Hadith narrated by Ibn Mas`ud,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«إِنَّ اللهَ قَسَمَ بَيْنَكُمْ أَخْلَاقَكُمْ كَمَا قَسَمَ أَرْزَاقَكُمْ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ يُعْطِي الْمَالَ مَنْ يُحِبُّ وَمَنْ لَا يُحِبُّ، وَلَا يُعْطِي الْإِيمَانَ إِلَّا مَنْ يُحِب»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has alloted character among you just as He has alloted your provision. Allah gives wealth to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He gives Faith only to those whom He loves.)</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿لَوْلا أَن مَّنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up!) meaning, `were it not for the kindness and grace of Allah towards us, we could have been swallowed up by the earth just as he was swallowed up, because we wanted to be like him.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.) He was a disbeliever, and the disbelievers will never be successful before Allah in this world or in the Hereafter.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ ﴾</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(83. That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) (84. Whosoever brings good, he shall have the better thereof; and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Blessings of the Hereafter for the humble Believers</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He has made the home of the Hereafter, and its eternal delights which will never change or fade away, for His believing, humble servants who do not rebel against the truth with pride and oppression in the land. They do not exalt themselves above the creatures of Allah, arrogantly oppressing them and spreading corruption among them. `Ikrimah said that this phrase referred to haughtiness and arrogance. Ibn Jurayj said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land) &#8220;Arrogance and tyranny,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ فَسَاداً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor cause corruption) committing sins.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ali said, &#8220;If a man wants the straps of his sandals to be better than the straps of his companion&#8217;s sandals, then he is one of those referred to in the Ayah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This is understood to mean that if his intention is to show off and appear better than others, then that is to be condemned, as it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«إِنَّهُ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنْ تَوَاضَعُوا حَتَّى لَا يَفْخَرَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَدٍ وَلَا يَبْغِي أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَد»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It has been revealed to me that you should be humble to the extent that none of you boasts to others or mistreats others. ) But if a person simply likes to look good, then there is nothing wrong with that. It was recorded that a man said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good &#8212; is this a kind of arrogance&#8221; The Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«لَا، إِنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَال»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty&#8230;) And Allah says:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whosoever brings good,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(he shall have the better thereof;) meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant &#8212; how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.) This is like the Ayah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) &#8220;Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do&#8221;) (27: 90). This is the position of generosity and justice.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿إِنَّ الَّذِى فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ قُل رَّبِّى أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِالْهُدَى وَمَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ &#8211;<a name="2"></a> وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُو أَن يُلْقَى إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبُ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ ظَهيراً لِّلْكَـفِرِينَ &#8211; وَلاَ يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ وَادْعُ إِلَى رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ &#8211; وَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴾</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad from Anas, radi Allahu anhu, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were sitting in the presence of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam one day and he said, &#8216;A person is about to arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person from the Ansar arrived, his beard dripping with water from wudoo and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave us the salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then next day the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said words of similar import and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam again said words of similar import and again this person appeared in the same condition, so when Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam left, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-Aas followed this person and said, &#8216;Indeed I have abused my father and I swear that I would not go to him for three days so if you would let me stay with you until those three days expire, I would do so.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas continued saying, &#8220;So &#8216;Abdullah told us that he spent three nights with this person yet he did not see him stand for the night prayer at all. All he did was <strong>when he turned sides on his bed he would mention Allah and make takbeer and would do this until he stood for fajr prayer</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;<strong>Except that I never hear him speak except good</strong>&#8216;. So when the three days were over I was eager to make little of his actions. I said, &#8216;O servant of Allah there was no hatred or disassociation between my father and me but I heard Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam saying on three occasions, &#8220;A person is about to arrive who is from the people of Paradise,&#8221; and you arrived on those three occasions, so I wished to stay with you so that I may look at your actions and emulate them. But I have not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so what is it that has reached you to make Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam say what he said?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;It is nothing more than what you have seen, except that <strong>I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;This is that which has reached you and is something that we cannot endure.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This hadith is authentic and classified as hassan. It is narrated in Musnad Imam Ahmed, and Albazar as well as others in many different chains.</em></span></p>

</strong>[audio https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/the-pearl-necklace-saleh-as-saleh.mp3]</p>
<p>This story is recorded in the book <strong>&#8220;Gems and Jewels&#8221;</strong> published by Dar-us-salam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qazi Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Abdul Baqi Ansari is an illustrious personality of Islamic History. He was the most pious person of his time. Even after the lapse of nine centuries, his exemplary life is a source of guidance to Muslims. His biographers tell a number of tales of his honesty and reliability but the one that affected his whole life is full of strange and unique events. He has narrated this story in his own words and it adorns the pages of history books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the middle of the 5th century Hijri, I was a student of the Holy Quran and Hadith in Makkah. During that period, I once became jobless and my means of income came to an end. I managed, somehow, to subsist for a few days but soon it became hard to obtain even two square meals. My studies were discontinued and I had to sell a few of my books to support myself. I was at the edge of starvation but my feelings of self-respect did not allow me to borrow or beg from anybody.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, I was hungry, as usual. I went to the Holy Ka&#8217;bah to pray to Almighty Allah to save me from my sad plight. On my way back, I saw a velvet cloth pouch lying near the road edge. I picked it up. It was nicely sewn and neatly tied with a silk cord. I looked around to find its owner but the road was deserted and nobody was in sight. I carried the pouch to my house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was curious to know the contents of the small bag. As I untied the cord, a very precious necklace of pearls slipped into my hand. The luster of the spotless pearls almost lit my room. The pearls of different sizes were nicely put together in a string of crimson colored silk. It was a radiant beauty and I was thrilled to hold the valuable ornament. For a moment, I altogether forgot the hungry and pitiable state in which I was. My thoughts went to the unfortunate owner who had lost the precious jewelry. He must be unhappy and very worried due to his great loss. The course of action which I instantly decided on was to look for the owner and give him back his necklace to relieve him of this mental suffering. It never came to my mind to keep it wrongfully in my possession. So I set out to search for him. Leaving the bag behind, I went straight to the place were it was found.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of excited men were standing there and were busy in anxious conversation. I went close to them. Their topic of discussion was the missing pouch of pearls. An old man whose nobility and magnanimity was evident from his imposing personality, was standing amidst them. He was explaining the loss of his pearls to the attentive audience and was announcing a reward of five hundred gold coins to the person who could help him in recovering the lost necklace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I listened to his account of the loss very carefully. When I was sure of his ownership, I held his hand gently and requested him to come along with me. He looked at me very hopefully and without asking any questions, he followed me. On the way back to my house, I was delightfully thinking that a handsome amount of five hundred dinars would be mind after a short while. The very thought of getting a reward of that much money was very pleasing. I was wondering whether my miseries would be over. I would no longer be a hungry or poor person. With such happy ideas in my mind, I entered my house and also invited the old man to come in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we sat down, I asked my perplexed guest about some marks of identification of his lost bad, so that his ownership could be established beyond doubt. He readily explained the shape and color of the pouch. He told me about its contents and gave an exact count of the pearls. He even described the tying cord. It convincingly proved that he was the rightful owner of the bad and the necklace of pearls. I silently rose and brought out the necklace pouch. As he saw it, his gloomy expression at once changed. His shining eyes beamed with joy and he looked at me with sincere gratefulness. His pleasant glance of thanks impressed me, and my own mode of thinking suddenly changed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A little earlier, I was enjoying the idea of getting a good reward but now my mind was reasoning as to what I had actually done to deserve it. It was by sheer chance that the bag had came into my possession. I had exerted no efforts to obtain it. Therefore, why did I expect to get a reward for returning it to its rightful owner? But I was actually in dire need of money. My poverty and the grim realities of life were looking me in the face. Why shouldn&#8217;t I accept the reward? It was absolutely legitimate and surely there was no harm in taking it. A painful conflict of indecision was going on within me and I was in an uneasy state of double mindedness.<br />
The noble old man was looking at the necklace again and again as to assure himself of its recovery. He then looked at me and said, &#8220;O dear me, you are a virtuous person and I thank you from the core of my heart. I am unable to express fully my feelings o fgratittude for your act of praiseworthy conduct. Nevertheless, I offer you a purse of five hundred dinars as a humble present and request you to kindly accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then placed in front of me a purse full of gold coins. A conflicting struggle of ideas was still going on in my mind. The sight of money which was within my easy reach was very tempting but I checked myself and said, &#8220;Sir, I thank you for offering me a substantial amount as a reward but it is impossible for me to accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked my noble guest, &#8220;You justly deserve the reward because I am giving it entirely of my own free will. I gladly give it to you as a humble token of my gratitude. Please do not dishearten me by refusing it.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Sir, I cannot even think of being rude to decline your kind offer, but iti is certainly improper for me to take it without doing anything to earn it. The necklace is yours and I happened to find it only by chance. Its restoration to you does not entitle me to take anything in return. Please do not insist on me to accept what is not morally due to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was rather surprised by my firm refusal. Normally people yearn for money but I was adamantly declining it. He said, &#8220;My son! It is a virtue to be an honest person but the money is which is being offered to you is not disallowed by our faith. It is not prohibited to offer or accept such presents. Therefore, I request you to reconsider your unrealistic stand and keep that purse for the sake of my pleasure if not for anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;Sir, I do not at all intend to displease you, but the pleasure of Almighty Allah is more important to be reckoned with than your or my pleasure. If there is any good in my action, I will prefer to leave the matter to His Grace for compensation, which I do not wan tot risk for all the riches of this world. Kindly do not insist because I am determined not to accept any undue reward.&#8221; My guest collected his pouch and purse and stood much dejectedly to leave. He patted me on the back and left without a word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a week or so, I got back my previous job. My days of deprivation and hunger were over. I rejoined my classes and forgot all about the incident I my busy schedule of daily routine. I exerted all of my energy to acquire knowledge of the Holy Qur&#8217;an and Hadith. My main subject of interest was Islamic Jurisprudence. I completed my studies with a distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the recommendation of my tutor, I was offered an appointment as Qazi of Qurtaba, (Cordova) the capital city of Haspaniyah (presently known as Spain). I readily accepted the post and started to prepare myself very happily for the long journey. I took leave of my colleagues and went to the port of Jeddah to embark on the ship for my destination. I boarded a merchant ship to carry me to the land of my future hopes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first few days, the voyage was smooth and very enjoyable. Then suddenly a violent storm of severe intensity overtook us and the ship was engulfed by stormy waves. The mountain high waves tossed the ship around like a tiny toy. The masts were broken and the sails torn. A mighty wave crushed the ship and wrecked it completely. A few screams were heard and it was all over. I saw some floating boards and a few victims of the crash swimming around trying to save their lives. They were the only survivors of the hapless ship who were drifting over the ocean surface. When I recovered from the shock, I found myself clinging to a plan and moving with it at the mercy of the waves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After drifting for two days, in a semi-conscious state, the waves tossed me upon the shore. I thanked Almighty Allah for saving me from the jaws of death. I was so weak that I couldn&#8217;t move. I helplessly lay there exposed to the scorching heat of the burning rays of the sun. I crawled to the dim shadows of a thorny bush. I lost track of time and was in a state between dizziness and heavy slumber.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some time, I slightly opened my eyes and saw a few strange faces staring at me. They poured a few drops of water into my mouth and I came out of my oblivion but was still unable to speak. They made up a stretcher and carried me to a nearby town. When we approached near it, the first man-made thing which caught my eye was a towering minaret of a Masjid. I thanked Allah for being among my own brethren of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They took me to a house belonging to one of them and laid me on a comfortable bed. With proper care, feeding, and treatment, I soon regained my lost energy. I told my kind host all about myself and the mishap of the ship wreck. My host, whose name was Faleh Hasan, informed me that I was in Hodeida, a coastal town of Yemen. The tract where I was luckily found was a desolate region and was a less treaded part of the coast. Faleh Hasan and his friends noticed a few vultures circling over the area, so they went to investigate and found me there in an unconscious state. He introduced me to his friends and I expressed my heartful thanks for saving my life. Due to their loving concern, I was soon normal, both mentally and physically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I began to attend Masjid to offer my regular prayers and there I came to know many persons of nobility and of high-ranking positions. They all knew my unhappy episode through my host and treated me with understanding and respect. One of them was the aged and pious Sheikh Ahmad bin Suhail who usually led the prayers. He always greeted me with fatherly affection which touched me to the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, he was a little late to arrive to the Masjid, so the people requested me to lead the prayers. My hesitation and excuses proved to be useless before their sincere appeals. That day I performed the duties of Imam. I did my best to recite clearly the Verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an during the prayer and afterwards delivered a brief sermon on Islamic Law. Everyone seemed to be highly impressed. Sheikh Ahmad bin Suhail came forward and congratulated me on my excellent performance. I thanked him for his appreciation and encouragement. I came back to the house of my host filled with delight and self-confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But later, I had sometimes thought that I had overstayed my welcome. So after the evening prayers, I stated my intention of leaving, but my host disagreed with me. He wanted me to stay for a few more days to recoup my health fully. At night, when I was going to bed, Sheikh Ahmad bin Suhail came with a few respectable people of the town. The friends of Faleh Hasan, who were my saviors, were also with them. When the preliminary formalities of greeting each other were over and all were comfortably seated, Sheikh Ahmad turned his eyes towards me and said, &#8220;Dear Abu Bakr, I have been honored by these gentlemen to speak to you, on behalf of them, about their commendable wish. I expect, you will please assent to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was perplexed by that kind of address. So I said nervously, &#8220;Sir, you are very helpful and kind to me. I cannot disregard any of your commands or wishes. You can order me to do anything and it will be an honor for me to obey it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Dear son, we all earnestly desire you to stay here with us forever. The regular Imam of our Masjid had died last year. We still mourn his death and perhaps will do so forever. His respect is deeply rooted in our hearts. He had enlightened our lives with the torch of knowledge. We wish you to take his place and consent to be our Imam. We may not be able to offer you a better paid position than that of the Qazi in Qurtaba, but we will surely give you our love, affection, and respect.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But Sir,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;I am a fresh, inexperienced student and feel small to carry out the sacred duties of the high office of Imam.&#8221; The Sheikh said, &#8220;My son, do not underestimate yourself. We all have heard your recitiation and sermon, and are fully convinced of your ability to fulfill those responsibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I could think of any evasive answer, my host, Faleh Hasan, and his friends vehemently backed up the proposal. I was left with no other alternative but to nod in affirmative. Everybody was pleased with my decision, especially Sheikh Ahmad who thanked me and kissed my forehead. They all rose to leave and thanking me individually, departed very happy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They left me thinking how the secret hands of fate change the course of destiny in a secret manner. Circumstances secretly take such a turn that they altogether change the plans made up by man. I had cherished the hope of being a Qazi of Qurtaba and had taken steps to attain that goal, but preordained events made me an Imam of the Masjid in Hodeida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a new phase in my life began. I took charge of the imposed position and shifted to the assigned house of the Imam. I restarted the primary school that had closed due to the sad demise of the former Imam. I also commenced evening classes to impart lessons to explain the meaning of the Holy Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I completely adjusted myself to the new environment and people generally accepted me as their religious leader. I was very contented and never for a moment regretted my decision to settle there. All the people, young and old alike, were happy and respected me. The feelings of any estrangement all faded away and I became as if I was one of them for ages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, Sheikh Ahmad came to me and after enquiring about my welfare, said, &#8220;Dear Abu Bakr, your services to or townsmen are praiseworthy and beyond our expectations. I am glad that you had accepted our offer of staying with us. Now have come to you to ask one more favor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;Sir, I am at your service. Please tell me and I will comply with your order.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Dear son, a man is not perfect without his partner of life. I want you to marry and take full advantage of life. Marriage is also a sacred Sunna of our Holy Prophet. The sweet marital responsibilities are a real blessing which have been conferred onto man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8220;Sir, you have always advised me in my best interest. I take you as a father to me and in this matter also, I will follow you counsel.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said, &#8220;Your predecessor, the late Imam of this Masjid was a very close friend of mine. He had a daughter, and when he was sure of his end, he entrusted her to my protection and care. Since then she has been under my guardianship. She is a lovely and adorable girl of good manners. Allah has endowed her with physical and mental beauty. She is virtuous and is a suitable match for you. I wish to give her in marriage to you and I feel sure that it will be a marriage of true minds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had no objection to the proposal whatsoever. A few days later, the bonds of marriage united us. After the festive ceremonies were over, Sheikh Ahmad escorted her to my house that was in fact her old abode where she had lived with her late father. I looked at her and my gaze was concentrated steadily on her. I forgot to even say welcome to her. I was not only looking at her beautiful and charming face, and at her downcast eyes; but my glance was riveted upon her pretty neck, which was ornamented by precious pearls. I at once recognized that necklace. It was the same necklace that I once found on a deserted road of Makkah. I looked at her in silent and open-mouthed wonder.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Ahmad noticed my confused condition and thought that her beauty and the luster of the pearls had enchanted me. He politely said, &#8220;Dear Abu Bakr, that necklace and its wearer, both are yours now and you can take all your time to behold them. It may, perhaps, interest you to know that the necklace has a strange story of its own. Five years ago, my friend went to Makkah for pilgrimage and took that necklace with him to get it re-polished. There, he lost it. But due to the goodness of an honest young man, he recovered it intact. That commendable young man refused to sell his honesty and declined the pressing offer of a handsome reward. He left a lasting impression upon my friend who always remembered and talked about him. He once confided to me that he had a mind to go to Makkah again and ask that virtuous young man to accept the hand of his daughter, but time did not allow him to do so. Anyhow, it was destined differently. His daughter was to become your wife instead of his. The decreed decisions of fate are strange and beyond the understanding of man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An emotional storm erupted within me. The strange happenings of the fateful events which were unfolded by the hidden hands of destiny agitated me and drops of tears rolled down my cheeks; I looked towards Sheikh Ahmad through misty eyes and said, &#8220;Dear Sir, you are very right to say that insight into the unknown mysteries of fate is not possible. It would perhaps be a pleasant surprise to know that I am the same person who found the necklace and restored it to your friend. He, in return, offered me an amount of five hundred dinars. Although I was a pauper and was suffering from the agonies of hunger in those days, my conscience did not allow me to accept anything that was not my due. I pinned all my hopes and expectations of Almighty Allah for any reward. And here I am with His gracious and greatest reward of all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Ahmad was amazed and without saying a word, he held my hand and shook it was a passion. My newly wedded wife lifted her eyes and looked me full in the face. Her eyes were filled with enthusiastic love that any husband ever could desire for. Almighty Allah had bestowed upon me His favors by giving me a considerate and loving wife and nothing in life surpasses that bliss.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying shares in companies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buying shares in companies is subject to further discussion, because we have heard that <strong><span style="color:#993300;">they put their money in foreign banks, or quasi-foreign banks, and take interest on it, which is a kind of riba</span></strong>. If this is true then buying shares in them is haraam and is a major sin, because riba is one of the worst of major sins. But if it is free of this then buying shares is halaal, so long as there is nothing else involved that is haraam according to sharee’ah. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/question no. 119).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Don&#8217;t miss to read the below interesting analysis :</strong> (excerpted from the net)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Take the top 500 corporate giants of India</strong> which are basically engaged in <em>Halal</em> business and their end products and services too are <em>Halal.</em> One shall be astonished to look at the capital structure of these companies as more than half of the capital of these companies comes from debt instruments such as interest carrying debentures, secured loans and other borrowing from commercial banks and financial institutions. In fact a company is said to be based upon strong fundamentals whose debt-equity ratio is in the range of 60:40 to 70:30. And nearly all these 500 companies conform to this criterion mostly. The moot point here is can a company be bracketed under <em>Halal</em> business concerns just because its finished goods and services are <em>Halal</em> even though the majority of its capital and finance comes from debt and interest-carrying loans. Take these top 500 <em>Halal</em> companies again. It is a bare fact that these companies park their reserves and surplus capital in high-yield and fixed income debt instruments and government securities. And sometimes the returns from these investments far exceed the income from their declared business. Corporate giant, Tata Iron and Steel Company which is ranked second in terms of market capitalization and weightage on the Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange is a classic case whose main income in the early 90’s came from such investments under the sub-head “Other Income”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Viewed from yet another angle, a good company’s capital, as stated earlier, mainly consists of nearly 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent debt. At times of boom in the economy, companies usually earn more than 100 per cent on their investments. But they pay back their debtors only the pre-determined interest of say 20 per cent and pass the benefit of the remaining 80 per cent to their equity share holders besides their own 100 per cent entitlement. Under this scenario the profit-sharing of the debtors and the equity share holders would be 20 per cent and 220 per cent respectively. Conversely, at times of economic recession, companies could hardly earn anything, and even the debt servicing has to be met with from the share of the equity share-holders such as company reserves and further borrowing. In the former case if the equity share holders get abundantly benefited from the <em>Haram</em> investment of the debtors, in the latter case, it is the turn of their <em>Halal</em> investment to get the raw deal at the hands of the <em>Haram</em> one. The fundamental question here is does Islam permit the intermingling of <em>Halal</em> and <em>Haram</em> investments with such dire consequences, and that too of the present magnitude? The plain and unambiguous answer is a simple “no”. How can the stock-market trading be termed <em>Halal</em> then?</p>
