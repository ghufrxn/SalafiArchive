										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 16874</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q4: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is raising the hands upward when supplicating to Allah after the end of Adhan (call to Prayer) an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After repeating Adhan and invoking Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), it is recommended to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, bestow upon Muhammad Al-Wasilah (the highest position in Paradise) and Al-Fadilah (extra degree of honor) and raise him to Al Maqam Al Mahmud (the best and the highest place in Paradise), which You have promised him</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah Al-Ansary (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) in Sahih Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him). <strong>However, raising the hands has no mention in the report, so it is an act of Bid`ah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: Fatwas of the Permanent Committee (<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=472&amp;PageID=11801&amp;SectionID=7&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=12285&amp;MarkIndex=1&amp;0#Raisingthehandsupwardwhensupplicating">alifta.net</a>) &gt; Acts of worship &gt; Salah (Prayer) &gt; Conditions for the validity of Salah &gt; Knowing that the time of a given Salah has commenced as a condition for the validity of Salah &gt; Adhan (call to Prayer) &gt; Saying Du`a&#8217;, Dhikr and performing Nafilah Prayer between Adhan and Iqamah &gt;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following has been taken from Imam Ibn Baz&#8217;s Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>171- What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands in Du`a&#8217; after Iqamah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have noticed that some Muslims, who are about to perform Salah (Prayer), raise their hands and supplicate immediately after the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer) finishes the announcement of the Adhan (call to Prayer). This takes place before Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer. Is this practice reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This action has no basis in Shari`ah (Islamic law). Nothing has been reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to supplicate between Iqamah (call to start the Prayer) and the start of Prayer. <strong>He was never reported as having raised his hands at this time</strong>. This should not be done because it is contrary to the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>

<p><strong>Du’a at the start of the prayer :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Messenger ﷺ used to keep silent between the Takbir and the recitation of Qur&#8217;an and that interval of silence used to be a short one. I said to the Prophetﷺ  “May my parents be sacrificed for you! What do you say in the pause between Takbir and recitation?&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said, &#8220;I say,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>اللَّهُمَّ بَاعِدْ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ خَطَايَايَ كَمَا بَاعَدْتَ بَيْنَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ، اللَّهُمَّ نَقِّنِي مِنْ خَطَايَايَ، كَمَا يُنَقَّى الثَّوْبُ الْأَ بْيَضُ مِنَ الدَّنَسِ، اللَّهُمَّ اغْسِلْنِي مِنْ خَطَايَايَ بِالثَّلْجِ وَالْمَاءِ وَالْبَرَدِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Allaahumma baa&#8217;id baynee wa bayna khataayaaya kamaa baa&#8217;adta baynal-mashriqi walmaghribi, Allaahumma naqqinee min khataayaaya kamaa yunaqqath-thawbul-&#8216;abyadhu minad-danasi, Allaahum-maghsilnee min khataayaaya, bith-thalji walmaa&#8217;i walbarad</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>O Allah , separate me from my sins as You have separated the East from the West. O Allah, cleanse me of my transgressions as the white garment is cleansed of stains . O Allah , wash away my sins with ice and water and frost.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Beautiful Humble Dua of Abu Bakr -RadhiAllaahu anhu- the Best of Creation after the Prophets</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said after an announcer praised him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I thank the brother, teacher Ibraheem for his statements and his praise, there is nothing that I can say in return except by following the first Khalifa Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq -RadhiAllaahu anhu- who was truly a Khalifa and the first of them for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; but even though he was the Khalifa when he would hear a person praising him with goodness &#8211; and I believe that praise, no matter how excessive that person was in giving it, as long as it was for the Khalifa of the Messenger of Allaah, then he deserved it &#8212; but along with that -Allaah ul-Musta&#8217;aan (Allaah&#8217;s help is required) [here the Shaykh begins to shed tears] along with that Abu Bakr used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، </strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>O Allaah do not take me to task with   what they say, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> واجعلني خيرًا مما يظنون، </strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and make me better than what they presume </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون،</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and forgive me for what they do not know.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what as-Siddeeq al-Akbar said, so what can we say after him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say &#8211; following him:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> اللهم لا تؤاخذني بما يقولون، واجعلني خيرًا مما يظنون، واغفر لي ما لا يعلمون، </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>O Allaah do not take me to task with what they say, and make me better than what they presume and forgive me for what they do not know.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The Shaykh cries trying to utter this statement]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth is &#8211; and I say the truth &#8211; I am not as was described previously, by what you heard from our respected brother Ibraheem, indeed I am only a student of knowledge, nothing else. It is upon every student of knowledge to be with the statement of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"> (بلغوا عني ولو آية، بلغوا عني ولو آية، وحدثوا</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> عن بني إسرائيل ولا حرج، ومن كذب عليّ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> متعمدًا فليتبوأ مقعده من النار)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;Convey from me, even if it is only one Ayaah, convey from me, even if it is only one Ayaah. There is no problem of narrating from Bani Israel. Whoever intentionally lies against me then he should take his seat in Hell fire.&#8217; </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 5: Is it permissible for the Imam to perform Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after performing the prescribed prayer while all the people are still present?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Acts of worship are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion). Therefore, it is not legally permitted to say that this act of worship is permissible with regard to its origin, number, manner or place without legal evidence for saying so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) where he did this, either from his sayings, doings or what gains his consent. All blessings are in following his guidance. The guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is established with authentic proofs that denote what he (peace be upon him) did after Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). The successors, the Companions of the Prophet and those who followed them in righteousness followed his example in this regard. Whoever innovates anything other than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), his acts will be rejected. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who did any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, that is to be rejected</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam who makes Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after Taslim and the followers pronounce Ta&#8217;min (saying: &#8220;Amin&#8221;) after his Du`a&#8217; should be asked to bring evidence that proves his deeds. Otherwise, his acts will be rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we will give an outline about the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after Taslim. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) pronounced Taslim, he used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Allah, You are the Grantor of security, and security comes from You. You are Blessing, O You Who have majesty and nobility)!&#8221; </strong>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awza`y was asked about the manner of the Prophet&#8217;s asking for forgiveness. He answered: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: &#8216;I seek the forgiveness of Allah. I seek the forgiveness of Allah</span></strong>.'&#8221; This is the narration of Muslim, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa&#8217;y. But Al-Nasa&#8217;y said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say that upon finishing his prayer, and then mentioned the Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After finishing his prayer, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: O Allah! You are Peace</strong></span>.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#8217;y on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) pronounced salutation, he used to say: O Allah: You are peace, and peace comes from You, blessed are You, Possessor of Glory and Honor</strong>.&#8221;[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported on the authority of Warrad the scriber of the servant of Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah that he said that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah dictated to me a letter to Mu`awiyah that When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) finished the prayer and pronounced salutation he uttered (this supplication): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone, Who has no partner. To Him belongs the sovereignty and to Him praise is due and He is Potent over everything. O Allah! No one can withhold what You give, or give what You withhold, and the riches cannot avail a wealthy person with You. </strong>[5]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim reported in his Sahih on the authority of `Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He used to say at the end of every prayer after pronouncing salutation (these words): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone. There is no partner with Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him and He is Potent over everything. There is no might or power except with Allah. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah and we do not worship but Him alone. To Him belong all bounties, to Him belongs all Grace, and to Him is worthy praise accorded. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah, to Whom we are sincere in devotion, even though the unbelievers should disapprove it</span></strong>. <strong>He added: The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say so after pronouncing salutation at the end of every prayer. </strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration reported also by Muslim the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He who recites after every prayer: Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from imperfection) thirty-three times; Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty-three times; Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greatest) thirty-three times; and completes a hundred with: La ilaha illallahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai&#8217;in Qadir (there is no true god except Allah. He is One and He has no partner with Him. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Omnipotent), will have all his sins pardoned even if they may be as the foam on the surface of the sea</span></strong>.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who wants to know more supplications should read supplications in the comprehensive books like Jami` Al-&#8216;Ousoul, Majm` Al-Zawa&#8217;d, Al-Matalib Al-`Aliyah Bi Zawa&#8217;d Al-Masanid Al-Thamaniyah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; [The Book of the Rites of Hajj: chapter (5): The Virtue of the Supplication of the person performing Hajj: (no.2893)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ibn Tareef narrated to us, saying: `Imraan ibn `Uyainah narrated to us: from `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib: from Mujaahid: from Ibn `Umar: from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The fighter in Allaah’s cause, and the person performing Hajj, and the person performing `Umrah are Allaah’s deputation: He called them, and they responded to Him; and they ask of Him, and He gives to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;; and he said in &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (no.1820), having quoted a supporting narration reported by al-Bazzaar (no.1153) as a hadeeth of Jaabir: &#8220;The hadeeth, when the two chains of narration are gathered is &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported (no.2895): &#8220;Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Shaybah narrated to us, saying: Yazeed ibn Haaroon narrated to us: from `Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan: from Abuz-Zubayr: from Safwaan ibn `Abdillaah ibn Safwaan, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was married to a daughter of Abud-Dardaa·, so he came to her and he found Ummud-Dardaa·, but he did not find Abud-Dardaa·. So she said to him: &#8220;Do you intend to perform Hajj this year?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then supplicate to Allaah for good for us, since the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The supplication which a person makes for his brother in his absence is responded to. There will be an Angel by his head saying: ‘Aameen’ [O Allaah! Grant it], to his supplication, ‘and may you receive the like of it’.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>He said: Then I went out to the market place, and I met Abud-Dardaa·, and he narrated the like of that to me from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Saheeh.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“Bless me in what You have given…”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>بَرَكَة</strong></span> (<strong>barakah</strong>) “<strong>blessing</strong>” literally means an abundance of anything good that is continuous. The scholars even trace this word and its meaning back to the word <strong>بِرْكَة</strong> (<strong>birkah</strong>) which means a large amount of water or any wide container or gathering of water that is constantly filled with water. Similarly, the word blessing means a continuously large amount of good. So the meaning of this statement is: <strong><em>Send blessings down upon everything you have given me.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording, “…in what you have given…” is comprehensive including anything Allah has given us of wealth, children, knowledge, and anything else Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) has bestowed upon us. So you ask Allah to put blessings in all of that. If Allah does not put blessings in what he has given you, you would surely be prevented from a great amount of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">How many people have a wealth in abundance, yet it is as if they live in poverty?</span></strong> This is because they gain no real benefit from their wealth; they simply collect it and never benefit from it. This is the result of the blessings being removed from it. Likewise, many people have lots of children and grandchildren, yet their children do not benefit their parents in anything due to their disobedience and ungratefulness. Such people have not been blessed in their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You also find some people to whom Allah has given a great amount of knowledge, yet it is as if he is illiterate.</strong></span> You see no traces of knowledge upon him in his worship, in his character, in his manners, nor in the way he treats others. Rather, his knowledge may even increase him in arrogance and considering himself to be above the rest of Allah’s worshippers, belittling and humiliating them. Such a person does not realize the one who bestowed this knowledge upon him is none other than Allah. You see that he never benefits people with his knowledge, neither with lessons, nor advice, nor with writings. On the contrary, he is exclusively centered only upon himself. This is without doubt a great loss, even though religious knowledge is one of the most blessed things Allah gives to a servant. One reason for this is that when you teach others and spread this knowledge among people, you are rewarded from several different perspectives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you spread this religious knowledge, you are spreading the religion of Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). So you work for the sake of Allah, opening people’s hearts with knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. From the blessings of spreading knowledge and teaching it is that by doing so, there is the preservation and protection of Allah’s legislation (religious laws). If it weren’t for the passing on of knowledge, the legislation would not have been preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Also from the blessings of spreading knowledge is that when you teach others, you do them a great deal of good. You give them insight into the religion of Allah. And when that person then worships Allah with knowledge and insight, you are rewarded with similar rewards he is given because it was you who directed him towards a particular good deed, and the one who directs another to do something good is just like the one who actually does it. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Also, by spreading and teaching religious knowledge, one’s own knowledge increases. It is known that anyone who teaches a particular knowledge to people, his knowledge in that subject will increase. This is because in teaching, one is recalling what he previously learned and memorized as well as learning new things that he must prepare. To this meaning, there is a famous (Arabic) proverb regarding wealth, “It increases by spending it often, and it decreases if held in a tight fist.” Similarly, if knowledge is withheld and not taught, it will eventually decrease.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] A proof of this is the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim (no. 1893), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2671), Abū Dāwūd (no. 5129), and by Aḥmad in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَنْ دَلَّ عَلَى خَيْرٍ فَلَهُ مِثْلُ أَجْرِ فَاعِلِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>Whoever directs someone to do something good, he will have a reward like the one who actually did it.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Explanation of: اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ</strong><br />
<strong> “Oh Allah, guide me with those You have guided.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Guide me to the truth and assist me in acting in accordance with it. Complete, beneficial guidance is that in which Allah combines for a servant both knowledge and action. Guidance without action is of no real benefit. Rather it is even harmful because if a person does not act in accordance with what he already knows, his knowledge becomes evidence against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of guidance in the form of knowledge but with no action is the verse of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As for Thamūd, we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance.</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We clarified the path to them and we conveyed the knowledge to them. However, they preferred blindness over guidance, and from this we seek refuge with Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this type of guidance – simply giving the knowledge and clarifying the truth – is the statement of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى)to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And certainly, you guide to the straight path.</strong></span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You direct the people to the straight path and teach them about it. As for the other type of guidance which is the granting of success, an example of this type is the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed, you can’t guide whoever you like</strong></span>.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type is the guidance of granting one success in their deeds. In this case, the messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) is never able to grant someone the success of their good actions as this type of guidance is specific to Allah alone. If the prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) were capable of that type of guidance, he would have guided his uncle, Abū Ṭālib. He did try to guide his uncle and even when he was about to die, the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Oh uncle, say, “There is nothing worthy of worship except Allah,&#8221; – a statement by which I will testify on your behalf before Allah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the decree of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had already passed that the prophet’s uncle would be from the inhabitants of the Fire, and from this we seek refuge with Allah. So Abū Ṭālib neither said nor believed that nothing has the right to be worshipped except Allah. The last thing he said before dying was that he would remain upon the religion of ‘AbdulMuṭṭalib.8 Despite this, Allah allowed his messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) to intercede for Abū Ṭālib, not just because he was the prophet’s uncle, but because he used to continually defend the prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) and Islam (even though he did not personally accept Islam). So the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) interceded for Abū Ṭālib and as a result of this intercession, he ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said about his uncle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is in the lowest part of the fire, and if it were not for me, he would have been in the lowest, deepest part of the fire.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) also said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the Day of Resurrection so that he will be put into the lowest part of the fire, it reaching only to his ankles, yet from which his brain will boil.</strong></span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we say in the Du’ā of Qunūt, “Guide us with those you have guided,&#8221; we are asking Allah for both types of guidance: the guidance of knowledge and the guidance of being successful in our actions. As an example, the following verse also includes both of these types of guidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Guide us to the straight path.</strong></span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when anyone says this du’ā he should sincerely call to mind that he is asking for both types of guidance: the guidance of the correct knowledge and the guidance of acting in accordance with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wording, “…with those you have guided,&#8221; this is a way of seeking nearness to Allah by mentioning his favors on others in that he guided them. So we also ask him to bestow the same favor upon us and guide us. In other words, we ask you (Allah) for guidance, and receiving it is only by virtue of your mercy, your wisdom, and your past favors as you have guided others</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muslim -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; [The Book of Purification]: (no.234): “Muhammad ibn Haatim ibn Maymoon narrated to me: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us: Mu`aawiyah ibn Saalih narrated to us: from Rabee`ah -meaning Ibn Yazeed: from Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee: from `Uqbah ibn `Aamir; And Aboo `Uthmaan narrated to me: from Jubayr ibn Nufayr: from `Uqbah ibn `Aamir, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We were tending camels, and my turn came, so I brought them back in the evening. So then I found Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) standing, speaking to the people, and I caught from what he was saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;There is not one of you who performs the wudoo·, and he performs the wudoo· well, and then he stands and prays two rak`ahs, turning his full attention to them with his heart and his face, except that Paradise will be binding for him&gt;&gt;.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So I said: &#8216;How fine this is!&#8217; So then someone in front of me said: “That which came before it was even finer.” So I looked, and it was `Umar. He said: “I saw that you came just now. So he had (already) said:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sending Salaat* Upon The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong><br />
[* i.e. saying &#8220;Allaahumma salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam an-Nasaa·ee</strong> –rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; (no.1297):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ishaaq ibn Mansoor related to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Yoosuf narrated to us, saying: Yoonus ibn Abee Ishaaq narrated to us: from Burayd ibn Abee Maryam who said: Anas ibn Maalik narrated to us, saying: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever sends a single salaat upon me, then Allaah will send ten salawaaat upon Him, and ten sins will be removed from him, and he will be raised by ten ranks</span></strong> &gt;&gt;.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah- declared it &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said in &#8220;Sifatus-Salaat&#8221; (p.165): ‘‘The most correct saying about the meaning of salaat upon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the saying of Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s salaat upon His Prophet is His extolling him [[to the Angels]] and exalting him; and the salaat of the Angels and others upon him is to request this from Allaah -the Most High&#8221;; and what is meant is seeking increase, not the initiation of salaat al-Haafiz [Ibn Hajr] mentioned it in &#8220;al-Fath&#8221;.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> -rahimahullaah, in his book &#8220;Jalaa·ul-Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati was-Salaam &#8216;alaa khayril anaam (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&#8221;, mentions <strong>forty benefits arising from sending salaat upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Compliance with the Command of Allaah-the Perfect and Most High. [i.e. in Aayah 65 of Sooratul-Ahzaab].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Conformity with Him- He the Perfect- in sending salaat upon him, even though the two forms of salaat are different. So our salaat upon him is a supplication and a request, whereas the salaat of Allaah-the Most High-upon him is extolling and ennobling&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Conformity with the Angels in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Attaining ten salawaat [[plural of salaat]] from Allaah by the person who sends salaat upon him once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. That he is raised by ten levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. That he has ten good deeds written for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. That ten sins are erased from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. That it is to be hoped that his supplication will be responded to if he precedes it with that. So it causes the supplication to ascend to the Lord of creation, when prior to this it was suspended between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. It is a means to attain his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Intercession, if it is accompanied by a request for alwaseelah (a singular station in Paradise) for him, or even if it is on its own&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. It is a means for forgiveness of sins …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is a cause for Allaah to suffice the servant with regard to whatever concerns him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. It is a means for the person to gain nearness to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the Day of Resurrection…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">13.( It has the position of being like an act of charity upon a needy person.)**</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. It is a cause for the fulfillment of your needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. It is a cause for Allaah to send salaat upon the person, and for the salaat of His Angels upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. It is a cleansing (zakaat) and purification for the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">17. (It is a cause for the servant to receive glad tidings of Paradise before his death…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">18. (It is a means for salvation from the terrors of the Day of Resurrection…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. It is a cause for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to respond to the one who sends salaat and salaam upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">20. (It is a cause for the servant to remember that which he has forgotten.) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. It is a cause of good for the gathering, and for its not becoming a source of regret for its people on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">22. (It is a means to repel poverty&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. It repels from the person the description of being a miser, if he sends salaat upon him whenever he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. He becomes saved from being supplicated against that his nose should be cleaved in dust, for abandoning it when he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It puts its companion upon the path to Paradise, and it causes the one who abandons it to err with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It saves from the stench of a gathering wherein Allaah and His Messenger are not mentioned, and where Allaah-the Most High- is not praised and extolled, and where salaat is not sent upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is a means for the completion of the speech which was begun with praise of Allaah and salaat upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">28. (It is a cause for the servant&#8221;s light to be increased upon the Bridge (as-Siraat).) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It takes the servant away from coarseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is a cause for Allaah –the Perfect- to bestow favourable praise upon the one who sends salaat upon him, praising him to the inhabitants of the Heavens and the earth. This is because the one who sends salaat upon him is asking Allaah to extol His Messenger, and to honour, and ennoble him. So recompense conforms to the type of deed, so the one who sends salaat must in turn receive some form of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is a cause of blessing for the one who sends salaat, in his self, his deeds, and his life, and the means of his welfare. This is because the one who sends salaat is supplicating to his Lord that He should bless him and his true followers; and this supplication will be answered; and recompense conforms to the deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. It is a means for his attaining the Mercy of Allaah, since mercy is either the meaning of the salaat –upon the saying of some; or it is otherwise something necessitated by it, and required from it-upon the correct saying. So the one who sends salaat upon him must certainly receive Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is a means to perpetuate his love of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم),and to increase it, and to multiply it; and that is one of the essential fundamentals of Eemaan, which it will not be complete without; since the more a servant mentions the one he loves, and remembers him in his heart, and remembers his fine qualities, and those things which instill love of him, then his love of him will increase, and yearning for him will grow, and this will overcome his whole heart. But if he turns away from mentioning him and from thinking of him and of his fine qualities in his heart, then love of him will be reduced in his heart. So there is nothing more pleasing to the one who loves than seeing the one whom he loves, and nothing gives greater pleasure to his heart than mentioning him, and thinking of him and of his fine qualities. So when this becomes strong in his heart, then his tongue will praise and extol him…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. That salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is a cause of his loving that person. So because it is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him to increase in love of him, likewise it is a cause for him to love the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. It is a means for the guidance of the person and for his heart to have life…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">36. (It is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to have his name presented to him, and for his being mentioned to him&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">37. (It is a cause for the feet to be planted firmly upon the Siraat, and for the person&#8221;s passing over it&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. That sending salaat upon him fulfils the slightest part of his right…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. That it comprises remembrance of Allaah and thankfulness to Him, and recognition of His Favour upon His servants in sending him. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) includes in his salaat upon him remembrance of Allaah and remembrance of His Messenger…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. That salaat upon him from the person is supplication (du&#8217;aa), and the persons du&#8217;aa. to his Lord and his requests to his Lord are of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) His requesting his own needs and concerns, and whatever he requires throughout the night and the day. So this is supplication and request, and is to give precedence to that which the servant loves and seeks;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) His requesting that He should extol His chosen and beloved servant, and increase him in nobility and honour, and make mention of him, and elevate him. So there is no doubt that Allaah-the Most High-loves that, and his Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) loves it. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has turned his requests, that which he desires, and that which he seeks towards that which is loved by Allaah-the Most High- and His Messenger; and he has given preference to that over his own needs and requirements. Indeed this that he seeks has become the most beloved of things to him, and that which he most prefers. So he has given preference to that which Allaah and His Messenger love over that which he himself loves. So he has given preference to Allaah and to what He loves over everything else, and recompense conforms to the action. So whoever gives preference to Allaah over everything else, then Allaah will give preference to him over others…&#8221;&#8221;</p>

Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: We have read a verdict from you published in “al-Da’wah” magazine that one should not pray for the overall destruction of Jews and Christians. Hearing this, we were confused by the seemingly contrasting supplication of prophet Nūh (alaihissalam). We hope you will explain this verdict of yours with the evidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated  by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to seek refuge for al-Hassan and al-Hussein, he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫أعوذ بكلمات الله التامة من كل شيطان وهامة ، ومن كل عين لامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said that this is how Ibrahim used to seek refuge for Ishaaq and Ismaeel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Tirmidhi with the extra wording, authenticated by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul Ulaa AbdurRahmaan al-Mubarakfooree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah’s words’:     ‘It has been said that they are the Qur’aan and it has also been said they are Allaah’s names.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perfect’:               ‘Al-Jazari said: ‘Indeed Allaah’s speech has been described as being Perfect, because it is not permissible for any of His speech to have deficiency or fault like there is in the speech of people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It has been said that the meaning of ‘Perfect’ here is that it benefits the one seeking refuge with these ‘Perfect words’, and protect him from illnesses and this would be sufficient for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Poisonous creature’:        ‘Every type of creature that kills with poison. And it is possible that it could mean any crawling animal even if it does not kill, like insects.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Evil eye’:              ‘From every evil type of affliction from the eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Tuhfahtul Ahawadhi’ an explanation of Sunan at-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>How to Seek Refuge from the Evil Eye for Children</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked over the phone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Phone rings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  <em>Aslaamu alaykum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       <em>Wa alaykum as-Salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         O Shaykh regarding ‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’ Is this said three consecutive times or just once?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       No, it is mentioned once, however if it appears to the one saying this <em>Dua’</em>that he needs to repeat it without specifying three times, then there is no problem with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         and should he place his hand on the head of the one sought refuge for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Even in congregation, if it is a group of children together, how can he place his hand upon all of them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       He should place his two hands on two of the children, then repeat this on the rest of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Right hand and left hand, with both hands?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  Regarding the hadeeth that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">would not sleep until he recited <em>Soorah</em> Mulk, al – Isra, Zumar, and Sajdah, is this when he lies down on his bed at night, or before he lies down?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       What is important is that he recites before he falls asleep, whether it is whilst he is sitting or lying then it is up to him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Silsilah Huda wa Noor’ tape No. 323 at 3:42mins]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing would have harmed you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Malik, Muslim, Abu Daawood, Nisaee’ Ibn Majah and by Tirmidhi who made it Hasan. Al-Albani authenticated it  in ‘Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ vol.1 no. 652 p.412.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751A.H.)<em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said after quoting this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know, that divine natural medicines benefit against disease after having been afflicted with it, and they prevent the disease from occurring. If it does occur then it does not occur in a harmful way even though the disease is annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed natural medicines also benefit after having been afflicted with a disease. So, <em>At-Ta’aweedhat</em> (supplications for seeking refuge) and <em>Adhkaar</em> (remembrance of Allaah) either prevent the occurrence of these means, or they either come between the disease and between the complete effect of it, and that is according to the perfection of the<em>Ta’aweedh</em> (supplication for seeking refuge) and according to the strength of it and the weakness of it. So <em>Ruqiya</em> (remedy by recitation of invocations) and <em>‘Aweedah</em> (a supplication for seeking refuge) is used to preserve ones health, and the disappearance of sickness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Zaad al-Ma’ad’ by Ibn al-Qayyim 4/182]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says three times, when the evening approaches: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then poison will not harm him that night.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhayil said: ‘Our families would learn this <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance), and they would say it every night, and a young girl from amongst them was bitten, but she did not find any pain.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Hibban in his ‘Saheeh’ and similar to it by Tirmidhi. Authenticated by Al-Albani in ‘Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ vol.1 no. 652 p.412.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> From Khola bint Hakeem who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever stops at a place on his journey and then says: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">nothing will harm him until he leaves that place.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Daawood, and by Tirmidhi. Al-Albani authenticated it in ‘Saheeh Jamia’ as-Sagheer’ vol.1 no. 6567 p.1118.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding his saying: ‘<em>I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Nawawee (d.676 A.H.)<em> -Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As regards his saying: ‘<em>I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’: it has been said the meaning of ‘<em>perfect</em>’ here is, those complete things where deficiency and defects cannot enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said: beneficial and healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said that the meanings of ‘<em>words</em>’ here is the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the ‘Sharh Saheeh Muslim’ by Imam Nawawee 17/2708/196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaama’ Muhammad Ali Ulaan al-Bakree as-Siddeeqee (d.1057 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘His <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying: ‘<em>in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’: means with the Qur’aan, and its complete meaning so deficiency or discrepancy cannot enter it, as it enters into the speech of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: the perfect words of Allaah benefit and its ability to cure from everything that is sought refuge from.  Which means: upon the condition that is necessary to have, namely the correct intention and the correct belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqi (d.458 A.H.) said: ‘they are called perfect/complete because it is not allowed to have discrepancy or any deficiency in Allaah’s words, as there is in the speech of humans,’ he also said: ‘that it reached me that Ahmad used this hadeeth as proof that the Qur’aan is not created.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> : ‘<em>Nothing will harm him</em>’ this generally includes protection for the soul and desires.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Futuhaat ar-Rabbaneeya ala al-Adhkaar an-Nawaweeyah’ 2/652-653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Sulayman bin Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin AbdulWahaab explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying: ‘<em>I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah</em>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allaah has legislated for the people of Islaam, that they seek refuge with Allaah instead of what the people of <em>Jahiliyah</em> do, which is to seek refuge from the <em>Jinn</em>. Therefore, Allaah legislated for the Muslims to seek refuge with Allaah and His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi (d.671 A.H.) said in ‘al-Mufhim’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It has been said the meaning is: ‘the words here are not attached to any deficiency or defect unlike the speech of humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said the meaning is: complete and sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: ‘<em>words</em>’ here refers to the Qur’aan, as Allaah informed us that it is: &lt;&lt;a guide and a cure&gt;&gt; [Fussilat: 44] and this aspect is with regard to guidance, in order to repel that which harms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As this supplication is seeking refuge with the Attributes of Allaah Ta’ala and turning back to Him, then this turning back to Allaah is something, which is recommended and requested of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, the one seeking refuge with Allaah and His names and Atrributes must ensure that he is sincere to Allaah in seeking His refuge and relies upon Him whilst seeking refuge. Thus, he recalls these aspects in his heart and in doing that fulfills his request and gains the forgiveness of his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Apart from what was said by Qurtubi, others have said, ‘the scholars all agree that seeking refuge from the creation is not permissible’ and they use the hadeeth of Khola to illustrate this. They say ‘this hadeeth is evidence that the words of Allaah are not created ‘and they use this to refute the Jahmiyah and Mu’tazilah with regard to their claim that the Qur’aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have said ‘if the words of Allaah were created the Prophet would not have ordered us to seek refuge with them because to seek refuge with the creation is <em>Shirk</em>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.)<em> -Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Imaams such as Imaam Ahmad and others have mentioned that it is not permissible to seek refuge with the creation, and they use this as evidence that the speech of Allaah is not created. They also said this is because it is established that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> sought refuge in the words of Allaah and he commanded us to do so. Due to this the scholars have prohibited the use of incantations and wearing amulets whose meaning is unknown fearing that it could be <em>Shirk</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever slaughters for the Shaytaan and supplicates to him and seeks refuge with him, thus coming closer to Shaytaan with that which he loves, then he has indeed worshipped him, even if it is not called worship, because he is truthful in it and in his service of Shaytaan. Therefore, he is from the servants of Shaytaan and from his worshippers, and due to this, Shaytaan serves him. However the service of the Shaytaan is not considered as worship of this person, because Shaytaan does not humble himself for that person nor does he worship him, unlike that person who actually worships Shaytaan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding the saying: <em>‘…..From the evil of what is created’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. from the evil of every creation which has evil in it, be it animals or other than animals. Whether it is from humans or <em>Jinn</em>, vermin or beast, wind or lightening, or any type of trial in the <em>Duniya</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In relation to this, the evil is not meant in a general absolute sense, it is limited in its meaning and what it refers to, as in ‘from the evil of all creation that has evil in it’ not that one seeks refuge from the evil of everything thing that Allaah has created. Because indeed Paradise, the Angels, and the Prophets do not have any evil. This is the meaning of the speech of Ibn Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding the saying: <em>‘…..nothing harms him’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al- Qurtubi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This narration is authentic and it is truthful speech. We know its truthfulness from proof and experience. Because ever since I heard this narration I have acted upon it and nothing harmed me until I left it. One night in bed a scorpion bit me, and I thought about what had happened and realized that I had forgotten to seek refuge with these words.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Tayseer al- Azeez al-Hamid’ &#8211; page 154-155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Nothing whatsoever harms him, because he has been protected by Allaah’s protection. However, this supplication is conditional just like all other supplications in that it is necessary to have the correct intention, to have good trust in Allaah – Azza wa Jal – and that a person should be regular in reading this supplication, in every place that he may stop in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Fiqh al-Adeeyah wal Adhkaar’ by Abdur-Razzaq al-Badr vol. 3 p.277]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is recommended for a Muslim that if he stops at a place, then he should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because if he says that, he will be protected and guarded by Allaah’s permission and nothing will hurt him until he leaves the place that he stopped in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a great supplication, in it is taking refuge with Allaah – Azza wa Jal -, adhering to Him and seeking refuge with His statements, in contrast to what the people of<em>Jahiliyah</em> were upon, in seeking refuge with the Jinn, stones and from other things which do not increase them except in sin, transgression, weakness and humiliation, just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the <em>jinns</em>, but they (<em>jinns</em>) increased them (mankind) in sin and disbelief.&gt;&gt; [Jinn:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah <em>– Tabarak wa Ta’ala –</em> criticised them for their seeking refuge and Allaah clarified their evil consequences and painful results in the <em>Duniya</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Allaah <em>– Subhanahu – </em>legislated for His slaves, the believers, was seeking refuge with Him Alone, seeking sanctuary with Him instead of with anyone else, since He has the Power and He has the authority even of the forelock of His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for anyone apart from Allaah then that person cannot even possess for himself any benefit nor harm, let alone for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Fiqh al-Adeeyah wal Adhkaar’ vol. 3 p. 276 &#8211; 277]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The correct way to recite in your prayers (Salah) and in Morning &amp; Evening supplications : By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool<br />
Translated &amp; Foreword by Umm Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Foreword:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you saying your morning and evening <em>Dua’</em> yet being afflicted by trials? This concise article may shed light on some questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool</strong> says speaking about the correct way in which one should recite silently:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Once one is aware concerning the conditions of reciting audibly and silently, the way in which some people pray with their lips closed and not moving their tongue until they complete their prayer. They do not move their tongues to recite whilst standing in their prayer. Yet they are meant to be reciting but yet they do not move their tongues in remembrance, nor whilst in <em>Ruku</em> (bowing) or while standing up from it, nor in <em>Sajood </em>(prostration)  or as they come up from <em>Sajood</em> or while they sit in the <em>Tashahood </em>(sitting at the end of the prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say that those people who pray like this, in fact <strong>their prayer is nullified </strong>because they <strong>have not recited</strong> in their prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the tongue must move in recitation</strong></span>, and according to some of the Scholars (<em>Fuqaha</em>) it is necessary to move the tongue in the silent prayers and you must be able to hear yourself. And this matter is of utmost importance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people say: ‘<span style="color:#ff0000;">I say my morning and evening supplications regularly and we seek refuge in Allaah yet we still experience afflictions</span>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So we say if you recite the morning and evening supplications then it is necessary to move the tongue while reciting them, there is no benefit if you pass your eyes along the lines of the page and to say that this is a silent reading. This is not considered reading or speech in the Arabic tongue. Reading in the Arabic language necessitates movement of the tongue, as is known from the hadeeth which is narrated from the Companions -may Allaah be pleased with them- that they knew when the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was reciting silently due to the movement of his beard. This illustrates that the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> whilst reciting silently would move his lips and tongue.  This moving of the tongue is if the person has the capability to move his tongue and that there is nothing to hinder the movement of the tongue.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Sharh Sifat Sallat an-Nabi &#8211;<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-‘ </em>by Muhammad Bazmool, p.221]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#666699;">by the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani <em>–rahimumAllaah-</em> quoted an <em>Athar</em> of Ibraheem an-Nakhai in ‘Kitab al-ilm’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They (the Companions) used to sit and study knowledge and goodness, then they would disperse and would not seek forgiveness from one another, they would not say: O so and so, make <em>Dua’</em> for me.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Shaykh commented saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which means that some of the Companions’ <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> making <em>Dua’</em> for others after the completion of a lesson or on ending study was not their action. This is a <em>Bida’</em>. Similar to this is when a shaykh leads his companions in supplication and they follow the supplication after him, because that is something which becomes a <em>fitnah</em> (trial) for that shaykh and lead him to marvel at himself.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ الْعَظِيمِ ، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ ، وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ خَيْرٌ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ فِي عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاصْرِفْهُ عَنِّي وَاصْرِفْنِي عَنْهُ وَاقْدُرْ لِيَ الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ ثُمَّ أَرْضِنِي بِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah I request of You with Your knowledge, and by Your Power I seek capability, and I ask of you of your great favour, since indeed You are the One who is able while I am not, and You know and I do not, and You are the One who knows the unseen. O Allaah if You know that this matter – here he mentions his need – is good for me in this world and for my living and for the matters of my Hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the future – then decree it for me and make it easy for me and bless it for me. And if You know that this matter is evil for me in this world and for my life and for the matters of my Hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the affairs of my future – then turn it away from me and turn me away from it, and decree goodness for me where ever it may be and make me pleased with it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Benefits:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The one who seeks guidance from the Creator and he consults the creation and is firm in his issue, will not have any regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and consult them in the matter. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allaah, certainly, Allaah loves those who put their trust (in Him). &gt;&gt; [3:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatada <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘There are not a people who consult over an issue desiring the Face of Allaah except that they are guided to what leads them to their matter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hadeeth Salaatul &#8211; <em>al-Istikharah</em> by Dr. Aasim Qurutee p.50 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Connection with <em>Tawheed</em>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah compensated the Muslims by giving them this supplication, which is <em>Tawheed,</em>and it is being in need of Allaah, servitude of worship, reliance upon Allaah, asking the One in whose Hand is all goodness, Who Alone can turn away evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He Alone who, if He opens up Mercy for His slave then there is none who can seclude a person from that mercy, and if He (Allaah) withholds it then none can send mercy to a person whether it is using omens, astrology or lucky stars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Dua’</em> is the good fortune for the happy person, it is good fortune for the people of happiness and success, those for whom Allaah gave them happiness before, and it is not good fortune for the people of <em>Shirk</em> and wretchedness, those whom associate another deity with Allaah, then soon will they come to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Dua’</em> includes the confirmation and testification of the existence of Allaah <em>– Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em>. The confirmation and testification of His Perfect Attributes, from the perfection of Knowledge and Capability and universal Will. And it includes the confirmation and testification of Allaah’s Lordship and entrustment of this matter to Him <em>– Ta’ala –</em> and seeking aid from Him, and relying upon Him, and a person leaves the responsibility from himself and acquits himself from any capability and strength except that it is with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>. It also includes the acknowledgement of the slave of Allaah of the weakness of his knowledge and his own interests and his own capability upon these things, and his desire for them, and that all of these things are in the Hand of his Guardian and his Originator and his true Lord. . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So the purpose of <em>al-Istikharah</em> is to rely upon Allaah and entrustment to Him and the capability to fulfill the action with Allaah’s Capability, His knowledge. And that Allaah chooses good for His slave, and this is from those things which necessitate being pleased with Allaah as the Lord. As a person will not taste the flavour of <em>Eemaan</em> if he does not have these things (reliance, entrustment etc), and if he is pleased with destiny after <em>al-Istikharah</em> then that is a sign of happiness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Za’ad al-Ma’aad’ by Ibn al-Qayyim 2/443-445]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regarding the importance of <em>al-Istikharah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The author: Abdullaah bin Muhammad al-Hamadi says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the human being has been created weak, and is in need of Allaah <em>-Ta’ala-</em> in all his matters and that is because a human does not know from where good and evil will occur in the future from incidents and events.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why, from the Wisdom of Allaah <em>&#8211; Subhanahu &#8211;</em> and from His Mercy to His slaves, He legislated for them this <em>Dua’</em> so that they can come closer to their Lord and that they can seek refuge with Him, and that He will direct them to the path leading towards good and benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Muslim slave of Allaah is upon certainty in which there is no doubt that the management of all matters and the execution of them is in the Hand of Allaah <em>-Subhanahu wa Ta’ala &#8211;</em> and He is the One who destines and executes whatever He wills in His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah Ta’ala says: &lt;&lt; And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses, no choice have they (in any matter). Glorified be Allaah, and exalted above all that they associate as partners (with Him).  And your Lord knows what their chests conceal, and what they reveal. And He is Allaah; <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </em>(none has the right to be worshipped but He). His is all praise, in the first (i.e. in this world) and in the last (i.e. in the Hereafter). And for Him is the Decision, and to Him shall you (all) be returned.  &gt;&gt; [al-Qassas: 68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘Allaama</em> Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Qurtubi al-Maliki (d. 671 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Some of the scholars have said: It is not appropriate for anyone to precede upon a matter from the matters of the <em>Duniya</em> until he asks Allaah for guidance in the matter by praying two <em>Rakat</em> <em>Salaat</em> <em>-ul-Istikharah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Jamia&#8217; al-Hakaam al-Qur&#8217;aan (13/202)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Following the Sunnah &amp; the Salaf]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Salaf as-Salih understood this meaning and would seek guidance from their Lord in all their matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The author brings an example of when Zaynab <em>–RadhiAllaahu anha-</em> married the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and she prayed <em>al-Istikharah</em>. The scholars mention that she did this fearing her shortcomings in fulfilling the rights of the Messenger of Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is how the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em> were eager to follow the Sunnah and to rely upon Allaah <em>-Subhanahu wa Ta’ala-</em> and seek aid from Him in preceding with their matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we follow the methodology of the Companions and those who came after them from the Salaf as-Salih that is why it is upon us to revive this Sunnah in our lives and rely upon our Lord <em>&#8211; Subhanahu &#8211;</em> for He is The Best Master and The Best Guardian, Disposer of affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Kashf as-Sitaarah an Salatul-<em>Istikharah</em>’ p.15-17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Shaykh Muhammad Hayaat As-Sindi <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> (d. 1163 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying in the <em>Dua’</em>: ‘If you know that this matter’:  This is not a doubt about the knowledge of Allaah Ta’ala, rather it means; the slave’s absence of knowledge compared to Allaah’s Knowledge <em>-Subhanahu wa Ta’ala-</em>, since it is impossible for something to be good, and The all-Knowing and The All-Aware not have knowledge of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hasheeyat as-Sindi ‘ala Nisa’ee (6/80) [Hadeeth Salaatul <em>-Istikharah</em> by Dr. Aasim Qurutee p.40 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[After the Decision has been made]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That <em>al-Istikharah</em> is not done when a person is uncertain about the matter at hand; because the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If any of you intends to undertake a matter’ and that the whole of the <em>Dua’</em> indicates to this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a Muslim is uncertain about a matter, and he intends to pray <em>al-Istikharah</em> , then he should make a choice between the two matters and then pray <em>al-Istikharah</em> , and then after <em>al-Istikharah</em> he executes that matter, and if it was good then Allaah will make it easy for him and bless him in that, and if it was not good for him, then Allaah turns it away from him and makes easy for him that in which there is good by the permission of Allaah <em>-Subhanahu wa Ta’ala.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Buggeeyat al-Mutattawa’ fee salat at-tattawa’ p.105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – What should be done after <em>al-Istikharah</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ‘Aasim al-Qurutee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh Kamal uddeen Muhammad bin Ali bin AbdulWahid bin az-Zamalakaani (d.771 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a person prays two <em>Rakah</em> <em>al-Istikharah</em> for a matter, then he should after that do what appears to him, whether his soul becomes delighted to his own-self or not, since praying <em>al-Istikharah</em> is good, even if it does not cause one to be happy with his own self.  ……. And there is nothing in the hadeeth that indicates that the soul should become relaxed as a condition for <em>al-Istikharah</em> to be accepted.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Tabbaqqat ash-Shafa’eeyah al-Kubra’ (9/206)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaykh Muhammad Badr ‘Aalaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And know that the scholars of the past and the present indeed pointed out that it is not conditional for <em>al-Istikharah</em> that the person who made <em>al-Istikharah</em> sees a dream or that someone speaks to him or something occurs to his heart and mind. But rather Allaah Ta’ala makes his heart incline or lean to the side which causes his heart to be happy and is resolute upon this.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘al-Badr as-Saaree ila Fayd al-Baari’ 2/247-248]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Seeing a Dream]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ‘AttaAllaah Haneef <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> (d. 1408A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Likewise, there is nothing in the narrations mentioning sleep after <em>al-Istikharah</em> prayer or recognizing that which is better for that person of what he may see in a dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I bring attention to this, because many of the people claim that <em>al-Istikharah</em> is seeking information from Allaah Ta’ala and seeking consultation from Him, so they invent principles for <em>al-Istikharah</em> which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>did not bring.  Then if they do not see a dream in their sleep, they go and seek guidance from others whom they think are righteous people. Upon my life, indeed this action of theirs is from a type of fortune telling which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> prohibited and it negates the <em>Sharia’</em> aim of <em>al-Istikharah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues: ‘[That <em>al-Istikharah </em>is having] <em>Tawwakul</em> (reliance upon Allaah) before the action, and being pleased with it after it. So whoever relied upon Allaah before it, and was pleased with what it fulfilled after <em>al-Istikharah</em> then he has established <em>al-Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude of worship for Allaah).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Taleeqat as-Salafeeyah ala Sunnan an-Nisa’ee’ (2/67) [Hadeeth Salaatul &#8211;<em>Istikharah</em>by Dr. Aasim Qurutee p.61-63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A Summary of the Explanation of the Hadeeth of ‘The Leading Supplication for Seeking Forgiveness’. </span><span style="color:#993300;">by Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Shaddad bin Aws <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the major supplication for forgiveness is</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, You created me and I am Your slave and I abide by Your covenant and promise as best as I can, I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed, I profess to you my sins and I acknowledge Your favour upon me, so forgive me verily no one forgives sins except You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma anta rabbee, la ilaha illa anta, Khalaqtanee, wa ana abduka, wa ana ala ahdika wa wa’dika mastata’tu, a’outhu bika min sharri ma sanatu, aboo’u laka bi thambee wa aboo’u laka bini’matika alayya, faghfirlee fa’innahu la yaghfiru ath-thunooba ‘illa ‘anta</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever says this with certainty when the morning arrives and dies during that day before evening, then he is from the people of Paradise and whoever says it with certainty in the evening, and dies before the morning, then he is from the people of Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari, an-Nisa’ee &amp; Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said about the preceding hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> about the Leading Supplication forSeeking Forgiveness is that when the slave of Allaah says: ‘<strong><em>O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You</em></strong>’ this hadeeth comprises well-known, magnificent matters and therefore it is rightfully the Leading Supplication for Seeking Forgiveness since it commences with the slave of Allaah acknowledging <em>al-Ruboobiyah</em>(The Lordship) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the slave of Allaah follows that up with Tawheed <em>al-Uloohiyah</em> (Allaah’s sole right to be Worshipped) by saying: ‘<strong><em>there is none worthy of worship in truth except You</em></strong>.’ So here he acknowledges that it is Allaah who created him and brought him into existence when he was nothing and so Allaah is rightfully The One who takes charge of complete beneficence to His slave with forgiveness for his sins, just as He <em>– Subhanahu wa Ta’ala –</em> began with beneficence to him by creating him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah then says: ‘<strong><em>I am Your slave</em></strong>’ by which he acknowledges that servitude of worship is only for Allaah, since Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> created the son of Adam for Himself and for His worship as is mentioned in some <em>Athaar</em> (narrations).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if a slave of Allaah leaves that for which Allaah created him, which is obedience to Allaah, knowing Him, loving Him, turning repentantly to Him and relying upon Him, then he has fled from his Master.When the slave of Allaah repents to Allaah and returns to Him, then he has repented to that which Allaah loves from the slave and so Allaah is pleased with this return. This is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned regarding Allaah Ta’ala that: ‘Allaah is greater in happiness with the repentance of His slave than that of a slave finding his lost ride, which had his food and his drink on it, in a perilous land after he had given up hope of recovering it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> is The One who is capable of returning his ride and Allaah was The One who returned it to him. This is the height of excellence and beneficence, worthy of he who is in this circumstance, and there is nothing more beloved to the slave than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah then says: ‘<strong><em>and I abide </em>by<em>Your covenant and promise as best as I can’</em></strong>.So Allaah <em>– Subhanahu wa Ta’ala –</em> made a contract with His slaves wherein He set out commands and prohibitions. Allaah promised them that if they fulfilled His contract, He would reward them with the highest of rewards. So the slave of Allaah continues moving between fulfilling his contract to Allaah and attesting to Allaah’s promise, meaning: I fulfil Your contract, attesting to Your promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This meaning was mentioned by the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in his saying: ‘Whoever fasts Ramadan with Eemaan and (<em>al-Ihtisaab</em>) hoping for a reward, then he is forgiven for his previous sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan here is the action which is: the contract Allaah contracted with His worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Ihtisaab</em> (hoping for a reward) is: hoping for Allaah’s reward by doing this action -which is not fitting except when attesting to His promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying: ‘Eemaan and<em>Al-Ihtisaab</em> (hoping for a reward)’ then the slave of Allaah is driven to do this, due to his Eemaan.Allaah legislated and obligated it, was pleased with and commanded it. <em>Al-Ihtisaab</em> (hoping) is the reward with Allaah which means the slave of Allaah does this action sincerely for Allaah, hoping for His reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying: ‘<strong><em>as best as I can</em></strong>’, then this means: I fulfil this according to my ability and that which Allaah has made rightful upon me, not according to that which befits You O Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement there is a proof which establishes that the slave of Allaah has strength and capability and that he is not compelled by destiny, rather he himself has the capability which is his being entrusted with commands and prohibitions, reward and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this statement is a refutation of the Qadareeyah al-Mujbirah (a sect who believe that destiny means that actions are due to compulsion); who say that the slave of Allaah has neithercapability nor potential by himself and that he has no decision over actions whatsoever, but rather that Allaah will punish due to Allaah’s own action and not due to the action of Allaah’s slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This part of the supplication is also a refutation ofthe al-Majooseeyah (fire worshippers) and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the slave of Allaah says: ‘<strong><em>I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed</em></strong>’ so the slave of Allaah seeks refuge, protection and fortification with Allaah, fleeing to Him from that which one seeks refuge from, just like the refugee who secures himself from the enemy in a fortresswhich will save him from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is affirmation of the actions of the slave of Allaah and his seeking his own livelihood and also that evil is attributed to his own actions and not to his Lord in his saying: ‘<strong><em>I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed</em></strong>’ so evil, in itself,is indeed from the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for our Lord (Allaah) then He has Beautiful Names, all His Attributes are attributes of perfection and all His Actions are Wise and for a just purpose.What supports this is the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘evil is not attributed to You’ as is mentioned in the hadeeth narrated by Muslim in the supplication for beginning the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah then says: ‘<strong><em>I acknowledge Your favour upon me</em></strong>’ which means I acknowledge this matter; i.e. I affirm this – that I acknowledge You with Your blessings upon me. You are The One deserving of this because You are The One who is praised and I seek forgiveness from You for my sins.This is why some of the righteous people said: ‘It is a must that every breath the slave of Allaah takes is one of two types; one breath where he praises his Lord and, in the next one, one where he seeks forgiveness from his sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the slave of Allaah testifies to these two matters then his <em>Uboodiyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) becomes correct, he is raised in degrees of goodness and Eemaan, his own self is diminished and he humbles himself for his Lord. This is the perfection of <em>Uboodiyah</em> by which he becomes free of being amazed by himself, of pride and of beautifying actions in order to show off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is The One who gives success and He is The One Who Guides. All praise be to Allaah Alone and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our leader Muhammad, his Family and his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them all.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 344- From Umar bin Abu Salmah who said: I was a young boy in the house of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and my hands used to take food from all over the dish, the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>&#8211; said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O boy! If you eat, then say ‘Bismillaah’ and eat with your right hand and eat what is close to you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Albaani said: ‘In this hadeeth, there is evidence that the Sunnah regarding mentioning the name of Allaah when beginning food is to only say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">بسم الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘<strong>Bismillaah’ (In The Name of Allaah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, there is the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> where the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you eats food, then he should say ‘<strong>Bismillaah</strong>’.  If you forget to say it when beginning then you should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫بسم الله في أوله وفي آخره</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Bismillaah fee awwalihi wa fee aakhirihi</strong>’.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tirmidhi, who authenticated it.  It also has a supporting narration in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth of Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was authenticated by Ibn al-Qayyim in ‘Az-Za’ad’ and was strengthened by al-Hafidh in ‘al-Fath’ where he said ‘It is the most clear hadeeth that has been mentioned regarding the manner of saying Bismillaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said, ‘As for the statement of an-Nawawi in ‘Al-Athkaar’ regarding the manners of eating in which he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The description for saying Bismillaah is the most important thing out of those things which are necessary to know,  it is best to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In The Name of Allaah, The Most Merciful, The Bestower of Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he says ‘Bismillaah’, then this would be sufficient and he would have fulfilled the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr continues: I do not see any specific evidence to support his claim of being better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (al-Albaani) say, there is nothing better than the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> <strong>‘And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad</strong> <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’  Therefore, if nothing has been affirmed regarding saying ‘Bismillaah’ when commencing food except the saying of ‘Bismillaah’ alone, then it is not permissible to add extra wording to that saying of ‘Bismillaah’, nor to imply that there is an extra wording that is better than saying ‘Bismillaah’ alone!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because using this extra wording opposes that which is indicated in the hadeeth,<strong>‘And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad</strong> <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (No. 344)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p><strong>1 – Making the Intention for Umrah:</strong></p>
<h2 align="center">لبيك اللهم بعمرة</h2>
<p align="center">Labbayk Allaahumma bi Umrah</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2 – Saying the Talbeeyah:</strong></p>
<p>Jabir <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> said:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> raised his voice with Tawheed: :</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>اللَّهُمَّ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>،</strong><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>لا</strong><strong>شَرِيكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>،</strong><strong>إِنَّ</strong><strong>الْحَمْدَ</strong><strong>وَالنّعْمَةَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>وَالْمُلْكَ</strong><strong>لا</strong><strong>شَرِيكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَكَ</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong>Labbaykallaahumma labbaik, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulk-laa shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner. [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3 – Making Dua’ When Seeing the Ka’abah</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘if one of you sees the Ka’abah he can raise his hands – due to this being established from Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, but it is not established from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he made a specific Dua’ here – and he can make Dua’ with whatever is easy for him, and if he makes Dua’ with what Umar <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> did then that is good due to it being established from Umar <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu</em>:</p>
<h2 align="center">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْك السَّلَامُ فَحَيِّنَا رَبَّنَا بِالسَّلَامِ</h2>
<p align="center">‘Allaahumma Anta as-Salaam, wa Min kas-Salam fa hayyina Rabbana bis-Salaam’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘O Allaah You are as-Sallam, and from You is peace and security, so grant us life O our Lord with peace and security.’ [2]</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>4 – When beginning the Tawaf at the Hajr al-Aswad [The Black Stone]</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is the Sunnah to say Takbeer [Say: Allaahu Akbar (Allaah is the greatest)] at the Hajr al-Aswad on every circuit due to the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said: the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>made Tawaf of the House upon his camel, and every time he came to the Hajr al-Aswad corner, he would indicate to it with what he had with him in his hand and say Takbeer.</p>
<p>As for saying ‘Bismillaah’ (In the Name of Allaah), then it is authentic from Ibn Umar that he would point to the stone and say;</p>
<p align="center">بسم الله والله أكبر</p>
<p align="center">‘Bismillaah wa Allaahu Akbar’. [3]</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>5 – The Dua’ between the Yemeni Corner &amp; the Black Stone</strong></p>
<p>From Abdullaah bin as-Saib <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>say: between the two corners [the Yemeni corner &amp; the black stone]:</p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong>رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt;&lt;Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!&gt;&gt; [4]</p>
<p><strong>6 – The Dua’ Upon Mount Safa &amp; Marwa</strong></p>
<p>From Jabir <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said: Then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> went out to Safa and when he came close to Safa he recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><strong>إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِنْ شَعَائِرِ </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا وَمَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَإِنَّ </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> &lt;&lt;Verily! As-Safa and Al-Marwah  are of the Symbols of Allaah. So it is not a sin on him who perform Hajj or ‘Umrah of the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) to perform the going between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily, Allaah is All-Recogniser, All-Knower.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">نَبْدَأُ بِمَا بَدَأَ اللَّهُ بِهِ</p>
<p align="center">Nabda Bima Bada Allaahu Bihi, so he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> began at Safa and climbed it until he could see the Ka’abah, and he faced the Qiblah [the Ka’abah], and he singled out Allaah and said the Takbeer three times <strong>الله أكبر الله أكبر الله أكبر</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> [Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar]</p>
<p align="center">Then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>would say</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">لَا إلَهَ إلَّا <strong>الله</strong> وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ ، وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ ، لَا إلَهَ إلَّا <strong>الله</strong> أَنْجَزَ وَعْدَهُ وَنَصَرَ عَبْدَهُ وَهَزَمَ الْأَحْزَابَ وَحْدَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things. He kept His promise, and aided His slave, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers).’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer, Anjaza Waaddahu, wa nasra ‘abdahu wa Hazama al-Ahzaab Wahaddahu’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>would say this three times and would make Dua’ between saying this. Then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>would do the same thing on Marwa as he did on Safa.’ 5<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7 – The Dua’ during the Sa’ee between Safa &amp; Marwa</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p>‘And if he makes Dua’ in the Sa’ee by saying:</p>
<p align="center">رَبِّ اغْفِرْ وَارْحَمْ ، إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الأَعَزُّ الأَكْرَمُ</p>
<p align="center">‘Rabb Ighfir warrham, innaka Anta al-‘Aa’azz al-Akram.’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘O Lord forgive me and have mercy on me, Indeed You are the Most Honourable and the Most Generous.’</p>
<p>Then this is permissible to say due to it being established from a number of the Salaf.’ 6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 371<br />
Seeking Forgiveness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And ask forgiveness for your sin&#8230;</span>&#8221; (47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And seek the forgiveness of Allah. Certainly, Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span>&#8221; (4:106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And declare the freedom of your Rubb from imperfection beginning with His praise, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.</span>&#8221; (110:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">For Al-Muttaqun (the pious) there are Gardens (Jannah) with their Rubb, underneath which rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives). And Allah will be pleased with them. And Allah is All-Seer of the (His) slaves. Those who say: `Our Rubb! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire. (They are) those who are patient, those who are true (in Faith, words, and deeds), and obedient with sincere devotion in worship to Allah. Those who spend (give the Zakat and alms in the way of Allah) and those who pray and beg Allah&#8217;s Pardon in the last hours of the night.</span>&#8221; (3:15-17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span>&#8221; (4:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And Allah would not punish them while you (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) are amongst them, nor will He punish them while they seek (Allah&#8217;s) forgiveness.</span>&#8221; (8:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; &#8211; and none can forgive sins but Allah &#8211; and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know</span>.&#8221; (3:135)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic Ayat on the subject are many and well-known<b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1869.</b>  Al-Agharr Al-Muzani (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Sometimes I perceive a veil over my heart, and I supplicate Allah for forgiveness a hundred times in a day</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1870.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I swear by Allah that I seek Allah&#8217;s Pardon and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1871.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By the One in Whose Hand my soul is! If you do not commit sins, Allah would replace you with a people who would commit sins and seek forgiveness from Allah; and Allah will certainly forgive them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1872.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: We counted Messenger&#8217;s saying a hundred times during one single sitting:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Rabb-ighfir li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa tubb `alayya, innaka Antat-Tawwabur-Rahim. (My Rubb! Forgive me and pardon me. Indeed, You are the Oft-Returning with compassion and Ever Merciful</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1873.</b>  Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone constantly seeks pardon (from Allah), Allah will appoint for him a way out of every distress and a relief from every anxiety, and will provide sustenance for him from where he expects not</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1874.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who says: `Astaghfir ullah-alladhi la ilaha illa Huwal-Haiyul-Qayyumu, wa atubu ilaihi (I seek the forgiveness of Allah, there is no true god except Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, and I turn to Him in repentance),&#8217; his sins will be forgiven even if he should have run away from the battlefield (while he was engaged in fighting for the Cause of Allah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim (on conditions of Al-Bukhari and Muslim for accepting Hadith)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1875.</b>  Shaddad bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best supplication for seeking forgiveness (Syed-ul-Istighfar) is to say: `Allahumma Anta Rabbi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> la ilaha illa Anta, khalaqtani wa ana `abduka, wa ana `ala `ahdika wa wa`dika mastata`tu, a`udhu bika min sharri ma sana`tu, abu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">u laka bini`matika `alayya, wa abu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">u bidhanbi faghfir li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> fa innahu la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta. (O Allah! You are my Rubb. There is no true god except You. You have created me, and I am Your slave, and I hold to Your Covenant as far as I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge the favours that You have bestowed upon me, and I confess my sins. Pardon me, for none but You has the power to pardon).&#8217; He who supplicates in these terms during the day with firm belief in it and dies on the same day (before the evening), he will be one of the dwellers of Jannah; and if anyone supplicates in these terms during the night with firm belief in it and dies before the morning, he will be one of the dwellers of Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1876.</b> Thauban (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) finished his Salat (prayer), he would beg forgiveness three times [by saying, `Astaghfirullah&#8217; (3 times)] and then he would say: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma Antas-Salamu, wa minkas-Salamu, tabarakta ya Dhal-Jalali wal-Ikram. (O Allah! You are the Bestower of security and security comes from You; Blessed are You. O Possessor of glory and honour).&#8221; Imam Al-Auza`i</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">one of the subnarrators) of this Hadith was asked: &#8220;How forgiveness should be sought?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I say: Astaghfirullah, Astaghfirullah (I seek forgiveness from Allah. I seek forgiveness from Allah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1877.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Prior to his demise, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate frequently:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Subhan Allahi wa bihamdihi; Astaghfirullaha wa atubu ilaihi (Allah is free from imperfection, and I begin with praising Him. I beg forgiveness from Allah and I turn to Him in repentance</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1878.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Exalted, has said: `O son of Adam! I shall go on forgiving you so long as you pray to Me and aspire for My forgiveness whatever may be your sins. O son of Adam! I do not care even if your sins should pile up to the sky and should you beg pardon of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam! If you come to Me with an earthful of sins and meet Me, not associating anything with Me in worship, I will certainly grant you as much pardon as will fill the earth.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1879.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O women folk! You should give charity and be diligent in seeking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness because I have seen (i.e., on the Night of the Ascension to the highest heavens) that dwellers of the Hell are women.&#8221; A woman amongst them said: &#8220;Why is it that the majority of the dwellers of Hell are women?&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. In spite of your lacking in wisdom and failing in religion, you are depriving the wisest of men of their intelligence.&#8221; Upon this the woman asked: &#8220;What is the deficiency in our wisdom and in our religion?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;Your lack of wisdom can be well judged from the fact that the evidence of two women is equal to that one man. You do not offer Salat (prayer) for some days and you do not fast (the whole of) Ramadan sometimes, it is a deficiency in religion</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 222<br />
The Superiority of Hastening to Break the Fast, and the supplication to say upon<br />
Breaking it</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1233.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will continue to adhere to good as long as they hasten to break the Saum (fasting)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1234.</b> Abu Atiyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:   Masruq  and  I  visited `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">O Mother of the Believers! There are two Companions of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and neither of them holds back from doing good acts; but one of them hastens to break Saum (fasting) and hastens to perform the Maghrib prayer, while the other delays breaking Saum and delays performing Salat (prayer).&#8221; She asked, &#8220;Who is the one who hastens to break Saum and perform the Maghrib prayer?&#8221; Masruq said, &#8220;It is `Abdullah (meaning `Abdullah bin Mas`ud).&#8221; She said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do so</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1235.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah the Most High says: `From amongst my slaves, the quicker the one is in breaking the Saum (fasting), the dearer is he to me</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1236.</b> `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When the night approaches from this side (i.e., the east) and the day retreats from that side (i.e., west) and the sun sets, then it is time for a person observing Saum (fasting) to break his fast</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1237.</b> Abu Ibrahim `Abdullah bin Abu Aufa (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on a journey and he was observing Saum (fasting). When the sun set, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to a person, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dismount and prepare the ground roasted barley drink for us</span>.&#8221; Upon this he replied, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, there is daylight still.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Get down and prepare barley drink for us</span>.&#8221; He said, &#8220;But it is still daytime.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) again said to him, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Get down and prepare barely drink for us</span>.&#8221; So he got down and prepared a barley liquid meal for him. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) drank that and then said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you perceive the night approaching from that side, a person observing Saum (fasting) should break the fast</span>.&#8221; And he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) pointed towards the east with his hand.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1238.</b> Salman bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you breaks his Saum (fasting), let him break it on dates; if he does not have any, break his fast with water for it is pure</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1239.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to break his Saum (fasting) before performing Maghrib prayer with three fresh date-fruits; if there were no fresh date-fruits, he will eat three dry dates; and if there were no dry date-fruits; he would take three draughts of water</span>.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1454.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Teach me some words so that I may recite them in the morning and in the evening.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite these words: `Allahumma fatiras-samawati wal-ardi, `alimal-ghaibi wash-shahadati, Rabba kulli shai&#8217;in wa malikahu.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) added: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite these words in the morning and the evening and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">when you go to bed</span></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1455.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When it was evening, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to supplicate:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Amsaina wa amsal-mulku lillah, wal-hamdu lillah. La `ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(We have entered upon evening and the whole kingdom of Allah, too, has entered upon evening. Praise is due to Allah. There is none who has the right to be worshiped but Allah, the One who has no partner with Him)</span>.&#8221;</p>

I seek refuge in You from lethargy and the misery of old age. O Allah! I seek Your Protection from the torment of Hell-fire and the punishment of the grave)</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it was morning, he (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) would recite the same, replacing the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">We have entered upon evening and the whole kingdom of Allah, too, has entered upon evening&#8221; with &#8220;We have entered upon morning and the whole kingdom of Allah entered upon morning</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Replace the words &#8220;Amsaina, amsa, hadhihil-lailati, ma ba`daha with Asbahna, asbaha, hadhal-yaumi, ma ba`dahu, respectively.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1456.</b> `Abdullah bin Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite Surat Al-Ikhlas and Al-Mu`awwidhatain (Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas) three times at dawn and dusk.

The Obligation of Supplicating Allah to Exalt His Mention and its Excellence,<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah exalts the mention of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and His angels supplicate Him to do so.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1397.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever supplicates Allah to exalt my mention, Allah will exalt his mention ten times.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1398.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will be nearest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1399.</b> Aus bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Among the best of your days is Friday; so supplicate Allah more often for me in it , for your supplications will be displayed to me</span>.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How will our blessings be displayed to you when your decayed body will have mixed with the earth?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1400.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1401.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not make my grave a place of festivity, and supplicate Allah for me, for your supplication reaches me wherever you are</span>.&#8221;<br />

[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1403.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned but he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1404.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard some one supplicating after his prayer without praising Allah and without supplicating Allah for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). With regard to him, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This man rushed.</span>&#8221; Then he called him and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any one of you have performed Salat (prayer) and wants to supplicate, let him praise Allah first then glorify Him in the beginning and then he should supplicate Allah for me. Then he may supplicate for whatever he likes</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1405.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>Muhammad  Ka`b  bin `Ujrah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to us and we asked him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, we already know how to greet you (i.e., say As-salamu `alaikum), but how should we supplicate for you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `Allahumma salli `ala Muhammadin, wa `ala `ali Muhammadin, kama sallaita `ala `ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidum Majid.

Bashir bin Sa`d said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Allah has commanded us to supplicate for you, but how should we do that?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept silent. We were much perturbed over his silence and we wished he did not asked him this question. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you exalted the family of Ibrahim. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are the Praised, the Glorified,&#8217; and the method of greeting (i.e., Salam) is as you know</span>.&#8221;<br />

Supplication before going to Bed</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth.</b></span><b>&#8221; (3:190,191)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1458.</b>  Hudhaifah and Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate when he went to bed at night: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Bismik-Allahumma ahya wa amut (With Your Name, O Allah, I expire and return to life)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1459.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me and to Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span>Ali&#8217;s wife and the Prophet&#8217;s daughter), &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you go to bed, recite: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) thirty-three times and Tasbih (Subhan-Allah) thirty-three times and Tahmid (Al-hamdu lillah) thirty-three times.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite Tasbih thirty-four times</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite Takbir thirty-four times</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1460.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any of you goes to bed, he should shake off (or dust off) his bedsheet because he does not know what might have fallen on it after he had left it. Then he should recite: `Bismika Rabbi wada`tu janbi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa bika arfa`uhu, in amsakta nafsi farhamha, wa in arsaltaha fahfazha bima tahfazu bihi `ibadakas-salihin [With Your Name, my Rubb, I place my side (upon the bed) and with Your Grace I will raise it up. If You withhold my soul (cause me to die), have mercy on it but if You let it go (let me live), guard it against which You guarded Your pious slaves]</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1461.</b> `A   ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to bed, he would blow upon his hands recite Al-Mu`awwidhat; and pass his hands over his body.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1462.</b> Al-Bara` bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whenever you intend to go to bed, perform Wudu&#8217; as is done for Salat (prayer); and then lie down on the right side and recite: `Allahumma aslamtu nafsi ilaika, wa fawwadtu amri ilaika, wal-ja&#8217;tu zahri ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika, la malja&#8217;a wa la manja minka illa ilaika, amantu bikitabik-alladhi anzalta, wa binabiyyik-alladhi arsalta [O Allah! I have submitted myself to You. I have turned my face to You, entrusted my affairs to You and relied completely on You out of desire for and fear of You (expecting Your reward and fearing Your punishment). There is no resort and no deliverer from (hardships) except You. I affirm my faith in Your Book which You have revealed, and in Your Prophet whom You have sent].&#8217; If you die during the night, you will die in the true religion. Let these words be your last words at night</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1463.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to his bed, he would say: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Al-hamdu lillah-illadhi at`amana wa saqana, wa kafana wa awana, fakam mimman la kafiya lahu wa la mu&#8217;wiya (Praise is due to Allah Who has fed us, provided us drink, satisfied us and gave us protection. Many are those who have no one to provide for them, or give them shelter)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1464.</b> Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) intended to go to sleep, he would place his right hand under his (right) cheek and supplicate: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma qini</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">adhabaka yauma tab`athu `ibadaka (O Allah! Guard me against Your punishment on the Day when You will resurrect Your slaves)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration in Abu Dawud, Hafsah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: Before going to sleep the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would recite this Du`a three times.</p>

Chapter 157<br />
Supplications in Funeral Prayers</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To pronounce four Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar) in the funeral prayer. After the first Takbir, after saying A`udhu billahi minash-Shaitanir-rajim, recite Surat Al-Fatihah. After the second Takbir, send Salam [Allahumma Salli `ala Muhammadin wa `ala ali Muhammadin kama sallaita `ala Ibrahima wa `ala ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid. Allahumma barik `ala Muhammadin wa `ala ali Muhammadin, kama barakta `ala Ibrahima, wa `ala ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid. Then after the third Takbir, invoke supplication for the deceased and for the Muslims as we will mention later on, in sha&#8217; Allah. After the fourth Takbir, supplicate Allah. (Some of the supplications of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), which are to be recited after the third Takbir are mentioned in the following Ahadith:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>935.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Abdur-Rahman `Auf bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) offered a funeral prayer and I memorized his supplication. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prayed:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahummaghfir lahu, warhamhu, wa `afihi, wa`fu `anhu, wa akrim nuzulahu, wa wassi` mudkhalahu, waghsilhu bil-ma&#8217;i wath-thalji wal-baradi, wa naqqihi minal-khataya, kama naqqaytath-thawbal-abyada minad-danasi, wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi, wa ahlan khairan min ahlihi, wa zawjan khairan min zawjihi, wa adkhilhul-Jannata, wa a`idh-hu min `adhabil-qabri, wa min `adhabin-nar [if the dead person is a woman, one should change the ending of certain words in this supplication from hu to ha] (O Allah! Forgive him, bestow mercy upon him, pardon him, accord him a noble provision and make his grave spacious, wash him with water, snow and hail, purify him from sins as You have purified the white garment from soiling, give him a better abode in place of his present one, and a better family in exchange of his present one, and a better spouse in place of his present wife; admit him to Jannah and protect from the trial in the grave and punishment in the Hell).&#8221;</span> (After hearing this supplication of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), Abu&#8217; Abdur-Rahman &#8216;Auf bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I wished I had been that dead man.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>936.</b> Abu Hurairah, Abu Qatadah, and Abu Ibrahim Al-Ash-hali (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) offered a funeral prayer and said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahummaghfir lihaiyina wa maiyitina, wa saghirina wa kabirina, wa dhakarina wa unthana, wa shahidina wa gha&#8217;ibina. Allahumma man ahyaiytahu minna, fa&#8217;ahyihi `alal-Islam, wa man tawaffaiytahu minna, fatawaffahu `alal-Iman. Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahu, wa la taftinna ba`dahu (O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, our present and our absent, our young and our old, our male and our female. O Allah, whosoever of us You keep alive, keep him alive (faithful) to IslÀm, and whosoever of us You cause to die, let him die having Iman. O Allah, do not deprive us of our reward (for being patient) and do not subject us to trials after his death.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>937.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When you pray over the dead, make a sincere supplication for him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>938.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicated in course of funeral prayer: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma Anta Rabbuha, wa Anta khalaqtaha, wa Anta hadaytaha lil-Islam, wa Anta qabadta ruhaha, wa Anta a`lamu bisirriha wa `alaniyyatiha, ji&#8217;naka shufa`a&#8217;a lahu [if the dead person is a man, or laha if the dead person is a woman], faghfir lahu [or laha, if it is a woman] (O Allah, You are its Rubb; You created it; You guided it to Islam; You have taken its life back and You know best its insight and outer condition. We have come as intercessors, so forgive him).&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>939.</b> Wathilah bin Al-Asqa` (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led the funeral prayer of a Muslim man in our presence, and I heard him saying<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahumma inna [name of the dead person] fi dhimmatika wa habli jiwarika, faqihi fitnatal-qabri; wa `adhaban-Nari, wa Anta ahlul-wafa&#8217;i wal-hamdi; Allahumma faghfir lahu warhamhu, innaka Antal-Ghafur-ur-Rahim [If the dead person is a woman, one can change hu in some words here with ha] [O Allah, (so-and-so son of so-and-so) is in Your Protection and inside the surroundings of Your Refuge. Safeguard him from the trial of the grave and the punishment of the Hell. You keep Your Promise and You deserve to be praised. O Allah! Forgive him and be merciful to him. Indeed, You are the Forgiving, the Merciful].&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>940.</b> `Abdullah bin Abu Aufa (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> While offering the funeral prayer of one of his daughters, he recited four Takbir, and after the fourth Takbir he continued standing for a time equal to an interval between two Takbir, praying for her and seeking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for her.&#8221; Then he said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: He (Abdullah) recited four Takbir and remained standing in prayer for some time till we thought that he would recite the fifth Takbir. Then he gave Salam on the right and on the left. When he turned aside, we asked him about it. He replied:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I would add nothing to what I saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) doing,&#8221;</span> or he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 151<br />
Supplication to be made soon after a Person&#8217;s Death</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>919.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) when his eyes were open soon after he died. He closed them (the eyes) for him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When the soul is taken away, the sight follows it.&#8221;</span> Some members of his family began to weep. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not supplicate for yourselves anything but good, for the angels say `amin&#8217; to what you say.&#8221;</span> Then he ü said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah! Forgive Abu Salamah, raise his rank among those who are rightly-guided and grant him a successor from his descendants who remain behind. Grant him pardon and us, too. O Rubb of the worlds. Make his grave spacious for him and give him light in it.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 170<br />
Supplication at the time of Riding</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride. In order that you may mount on their backs, and then may remember the Favour of your Rubb when you mount thereon, and say: `Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could never have it (by our efforts). And verily, to Our Rubb we indeed are to return!&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (43:12-14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>972.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mounted his camel for setting out on a journey, he would recite: &#8220;Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greatest),&#8221; thrice. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Subhanal-ladhi sakh-khara lana hadha, wa ma kunna lahu muqrinin, wa inna ila Rabbina lamunqalibun. Allahumma inna nas&#8217;aluka fi safarina hadh al-birra wat-taqwa, wa minal-`amali ma tarda. Allahumma hawwin `alaina safarana hadha, watwi `anna bu`dahu. Allahumma Antas-Sahibu fissafari, wal-Khalifatu fil-ahli. Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min wa`ta&#8217;is-safari, wa kaabatil-manzari, wa su</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">il-munqalabi fil-mali wal-ahli wal-waladi (Far removed from imperfection is the One Who has made this subservient to us, for we have no power to subjugate it, and certainly to our Rubb shall we return. O Allah, we ask You during this journey of ours for righteousness, piety and such deeds as are pleasing to You. O Allah, make easy for us this journey of ours and make the distance short for us. O Allah, You are our Companion during the journey and the Guardian of the family and the property in our absence. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the hardships of travelling, unhappiness connected with ghastly scenes and evil turns in property and family).</span>&#8221; When he returned, he recited this supplication making addition of these words:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ayibuna, ta&#8217;ibuna, `abiduna, li-Rabbina hamidun (We are those who return; those who repent; those who worship and those who praise our Rubb).&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>973.</b> `Abdullah bin Sarjis (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) proceeded on a journey, he would seek refuge in Allah from the hardships of the journey, and against deviation after guidance, and against the supplication of the oppressed, and occurrences of unpleasant events in the family and property. He would say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min wa`tha&#8217;is-safari, wa kaabatil-munqalabi, wal-hauri ba`dal-kauni, wa da`watil-mazlumi, wa su</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">il-manzari fil-ahli wal-mal.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>974.</b> `Ali bin Rabi`ah reported: In my presence, a beast was brought to `Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) for riding. When he put his foot in the stirrup, he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Bismillah (With the Name of Allah).&#8221;</span> When he had settled himself on its back he recited:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Al-hamdu lillahil-ladhi sakh-khara lana hadha, wa ma kunna lahu muqrinin, wa inna ila Rabbina lamunqalibun. (All praise belongs to Allah Who has made this subservient to us, for we had not the strength to overpower it; and to our Rubb shall we return).&#8221;</span> He then recited thrice:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Alhamdu lillah (Praise be to Allah),</span>&#8221; and then three times:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Allahu Abkar (Allah is Greatest).</span>&#8221; Then he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Subhanaka inni zalamtu nafsi faghfir li, innahu la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta (You are far removed from imperfection I have wronged myself, so forgive me, because none but You can forgive sins).&#8221;</span> Then he smiled. It was asked:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Why have you smiled, O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin (Leader of the Believers)?&#8221;</span> He replied:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) doing as I have done. I (i.e., Ali) asked him (the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) the reason for smiling.</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Your Rubb, Glorious is He, is pleased when His slave seeks His forgiveness.</span> He (the slave) has firm faith that none except Allah Alone can forgive sins)&#8217;.&#8221;<br />

What is to be said at the time of Sleeping</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>814.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Whenever Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to bed, he would lie down on his right side and recite:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahumma aslamtu nafsi ilaika, wa wajjahtu wajhi ilaika, wa fawwadtu amri ilaika, wa &#8216;alja&#8217;tu zahri ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika, la malja&#8217;a wa la manja illa ilaika. Amantu bikitabikal-ladhi anzalta, wa nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta [O Allah! I have submitted myself to You, I have turned my face to You, committed my affairs to You, and depend on You for protection out of desire for You and out of fear of You (expecting Your reward and fearing Your punishment). There is no refuge and no place of safety from You but with You. I believed in the Book You have revealed, and in the Prophet You have sent (i.e., Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)).]&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>815.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed me thus:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whenever you go to bed, perform Wudu&#8217; as you do for Salat then (before sleeping) recite: `O Allah! I have submitted myself to You, I have turned myself to You, committed my affairs to You and sought Your refuge for protection out of desire for You and fear of You (expecting Your reward and fearing Your punishment). There is no refuge and no place of safety from You but with You. I believe in the Book You have revealed and in the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) You have sent.&#8221;&#8217;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If anyone recites these words and dies during the night, he will die on the true Deen, and if he remains alive till the morning, he will obtain good. And make this supplication your last words (before sleeping).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>816.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to offer eleven Rak`ah of optional Salat (prayers) in the latter part of night. When it was about dawn, he would offer two short Rak`ah and then would lie down on his right side till the Mu&#8217;adhdhin (one who calls for prayer) would come to inform him that the congregation had gathered (for prayer).</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>817.</b> Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) lay down for sleep at night, he would place his (right) hand under his (right) cheek and supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Bismika Allahumma amutu wa ahya [O Allah, with Your Name will I die and live (wake up)].&#8221;</span> And when he woke up, he would supplicate: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Al-hamdu lillahil-ladhi ahyana ba`da ma amatana, wa ilaihin-nushur (All praise is due to Allah, Who has brought us back to life after He has caused us to die, and to Him is the return).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>818.</b> Ya`ish bin Tikhfah Al-Ghifari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: My father said: I was lying down on my belly in the mosque when someone shook me with his foot and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Lying down this way is disapproved by Allah.&#8221;</span> I looked up and saw that it was Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>819.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever sits in a place where he does not remember Allah (SWT), he will suffer loss and incur displeasure of Allah; and whoever lies down (to sleep) in a place where he does not remember Allah, he will suffer sorrow and incur displeasure of Allah.&#8221;<br />

Istikhara (Seeking Guidance from Allah), and Consultation</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah, the Exalted, says:</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>718.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to teach us the Istikharah (seeking guidance from Allah) in all matters as he would teach us a Surah of the Qur&#8217;an. He used to say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you contemplates entering upon an enterprise, let him perform two Rak`ah of optional prayer other than Fard prayers and then supplicate: &#8220;Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi `ilmika, wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika, wa as-&#8216;aluka min fadlikal-`azim.

O Allah, if You know that this matter (and name it) is good for me in respect of my Deen, my livelihood and the consequences of my affairs,</span> (or he said),<span style="color:#0000ff;"> the sooner or the later of my affairs then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abbas bin Tamim&#8217;s uncle: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (p.b.u.h) went out to offer the Istisqa&#8217; prayer  and turned (and put on) his cloak inside out. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 120: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the  bowing in the last Raka he used to say: &#8220;O Allah! Save &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a. O  Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah! Save the weak  faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of Mudar and send (famine) years on  them like the famine years of (Prophet) Joseph .&#8221; The Prophet further said,  &#8220;Allah forgive the tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam.&#8221; Abu Az-Zinad  (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in the Fajr  prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 121: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Masruq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with &#8216;Abdullah and he said, &#8220;When the Prophet  saw the refusal of the people to accept Islam he said, &#8220;O Allah! Send (famine) years  on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the time) of (Prophet)  Joseph.&#8221; So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kind of life to  such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals.  Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke  because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You order  people to obey Allah and to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of  your tribe are dying, so please pray to Allah for them.&#8221; So Allah revealed:  &#8220;Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly  visible &#8230; Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall seize You with  a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, &#8220;Al-Batsha (i.e. grasp) happened in the  battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have  all passed . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Dinar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father said, &#8220;I heard Ibn &#8216;Umar reciting the poetic  verses of Abu Talib: And a white (person) (i.e. the Prophet) who is requested to pray for  rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows.&#8221; Salim&#8217;s father  (Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;The following poetic verse occurred to my mind while I was looking  at the face of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down  till the rain water flowed profusely from every roof-g utter: And a white (person) who is  requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows  . . . And these were the words of Abu Talib.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever drought threatened them, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab,  used to ask Al-Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib to invoke Allah for rain. He used to say, &#8220;O  Allah! We used to ask our Prophet to invoke You for rain, and You would bless us with  rain, and now we ask his uncle to invoke You for rain. O Allah ! Bless us with  rain.&#8221;(1) And so it would rain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sharik bin &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Namir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik saying, &#8220;On a Friday a person  entered the main Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah for  rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!&#8217;  &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;By Allah, we could not see any trace of cloud in the sky and  there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains of) Sila.&#8221; Anas added,  &#8220;A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Sila&#8217; Mountain). When it  came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained.&#8221; Anas further said,  &#8220;By Allah! We could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through  the same gate and at that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delivering the Friday&#8217;s Khutba. The man  stood in front of him and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads  are cut off, please pray to Allah to with-hold rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle I raised both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah! Round about us and not on us. O Allah!  On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the valleys and on the places where  trees grow.&#8217; So the rain stopped and we came out walking in the sun.&#8221; Sharik asked  Anas whether it was the same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas  replied that he did not know. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A person entered the Mosque on a  Friday through the gate facing the Daril-Qada&#8217; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing delivering  the Khutba (sermon).

Bless us with rain. O  Allah! Bless us with rain. O Allah! Bless us with rain!&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;By Allah,  there were no clouds in the sky and there was no house or building between us and the  mountain of Silas&#8217;. Then a big cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Silas  Mountain) and when it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained. By Allah!  We could not see the sun for a week. The next Friday, a person entered through the same  gate and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delivering the Friday Khutba and the man stood in front of  him and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off;  Please pray to Allah to withhold rain.&#8217; &#8221; Anas added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised  both his hands and said, &#8216;O Allah!

Rain is  scarce; please ask Allah to bless us with rain.&#8217; So he invoked Allah for it, and it rained  so much that we could hardly reach our homes and it continued raining till the next  Friday.&#8221; Anas further said, &#8220;Then the same or some other person stood up and  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8217; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle I  said, &#8216;O Allah!

The same person came  again and said, &#8220;Houses have collapsed, roads are cut off, and the livestock are  destroyed.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 17, Number 133: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Masruq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day I went to Ibn Masud who said, &#8220;When Quraish  delayed in embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they were  afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died and they ate the  carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Muhammad! You came to order  people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so  invoke Allah I ? So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: &#8216;Then watch  you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.&#8217; (44.10)  When the famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The  statement of Allah, (in Sura &#8220;Ad-Dukhan&#8221;-44) refers to that: &#8216;On the day when We  shall seize You with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of the  battle of Badr.&#8221; Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the  excessive rain. The Prophet said, &#8216;O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8217; So the  clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle I was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on a  Friday when the people stood up, shouted and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is no  rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed; Please pray to Allah  for rain.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said twice, &#8220;O Allah! Bless us with rain.&#8221; By  Allah, there was no trace of cloud in the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with  clouds and it started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the prayer.  When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was raining and it rained continuously  till the next Friday. When the Prophet started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the  people started shouting and said to him, &#8220;The houses have collapsed and the roads are  cut off; so please pray to Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; So the Prophet smiled and  said, &#8220;O Allah! Round about us and not on us.&#8221; So the sky became clear over  Medina but it kept on raining over the outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain  fell over Median. I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet never raised his hands for any invocation  except for that of Istisqa&#8217; and he used to raise them so much that the whiteness of his  armpits became visible. (Note: It may be that Anas did not see the Prophet raising his  hands, but it is narrated that the Prophet used to raise his hands for invocations other  than Istisqa.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the people  were afflicted with a (famine) year. While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba (sermon)  on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The  livestock are dying and the families (offspring) are hungry: please pray to Allah to bless  us with rain.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time  there was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started gathering like  mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw rain-water trickling down his beard.  It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday,  when the same Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The houses have collapsed and the livestock are drowned. Please  invoke Allah for us.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O  Allah! Around us and not on us.&#8221; Whichever side the Prophet directed his hand, the  clouds dispersed from there till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley  of Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from outside who  didn&#8217;t talk about the abundant rain. </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Pillar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Muhammadin kamaa Salayta &#8216;alaa ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali ibraaheema Innaka Hameedun Majeed&#8221;</span> [O Allaah, send your praises upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you sent praises upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Verily, You are Most-Praiseworthy, Most Glorified]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This version of the tashahhud is well known. There are other forms of it as well.You may memorize whichever wording of the tashahhud that you like. However, choose one that is agreed upon. And if you hear someone using a tashahhud that varies from this one, do not condemn him.Tha same could be said about sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) if you have memorized the version mentioned here by the author. There are other ways of saying it as well. And we have stated many times that there exists many ways of doing it. Perhaps all of these ways (of sending salaat on the Prophet) have been gathered together by the great Scholar Ibn Al-Qavvim in his book which is unique in its subject: Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat mentioned here (i.e. above) is known as the Abrahamic Salaat. The most comprehensive form of it is the one that has been agreed upon, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa salaita &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed. Wa Baarik Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This manner of saying it is agreed upon. And there are many other ways. However you should take note that none of the versions of the Abrahamic Salaat that have been recorded by Ibn Al-Qayyim in his afore-mentioned book contain an mention of the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; our master) such as: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Many of our sensitive Muslim brothers, if you don&#8217;t say &#8220;<strong>Sayyidinaa</strong>&#8221; when sending Salaat and just say &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; , will perhaps think bad thoughts about you and say: &#8220;This person doesn&#8217;t have any respect for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">In fact, this very thing actually did happen, for one time a Moroccan man on Hajj told me: &#8220;0 Shaikh! I have attended your lessons from the first class till now while traveling. But I notice about you that when you send Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you say &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217; and I never heard you once say: &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8217; Why is this O Shaikh?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He asked a good question and I clarified the matter to him, thus reducing the irritation found in him since he would become very annoyed whenever he would hear someone send Salaat on the Prophet and not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Muslim common-folk do not make any distinction in matters. Perhaps they think that someone who leaves out the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; does not respect the Prophet and does not love him in the manner that he deserves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">The reply: This is ignorance. It may even be called compound ignorance. Compound ignorance is when someone is ignorant and he doesn&#8217;t know that he is ignorant. If you don&#8217;t know that you don&#8217;t know something then this is ignorance on top of ignorance. So what is it that someone with ignorance attached to him knows? Nothing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our leader (Sayyid). He is the leader of all of mankind &#8211; all of the descendants of Aadam. This is what I worship Allaah with. We must believe this, in accordance with what he has informed us: &#8220;I am the Sayyid (leader) of mankind on the Day of Judgement. I am the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam, and I do not say this to boast&#8221; We are obligated to believe that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in spite of this, when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught the Companions how to send Salaat on him and when he dictated the Abrahamic Salaat to them during the revelation of the ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah and His Angels send Salaat (praises) on the Prophet. O you who believe, send your praises (Salaat) and greetings (Salaam) on him&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this ayah was revealed, the Companions asked: &#8220;0 Messenger of Allaah(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you have already taught us how to send greetings (of Salaam) upon you, but we have been ordered to (also) send praises (Salaat) upon you, so how do we send Salaat on you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this sort of questioning occurred in several different gatherings based on the fact that there are numerous manners of sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam). The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught his Companions to say it like this: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad.&#8221; This does not mean that he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) revoked his status of leadership and that he was no longer a Sayyid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have noted that at times the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn people in certain circumstances who would make statements that were understood to contain exaggeration and extremism with regard to himself. He (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn the one who said: &#8220;You are our Sayyid (leader), son of our Sayyid. And you are the best among us, son of the best among us&#8221; even though he really is the Sayyid (leader) of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he did this because he feared that this man was being afflicted with extremism. Going to extremes with regard to the righteous people is one of the main causes of others being worshipped besides Allaah. So in order to protect the sanctuary of Tawheed, he told him no. He forbade him from (saying) that, saying: &#8220;I am only a slave, so say: &#8216;The slave and messenger of Alhall.'&#8221; This was even in spite of his prior statement in which he announced that he was the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam. However, there is no contradiction between this statement and that statement since each situation warrants its own statement depending on its circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The situation in which the Prophet condemned the man was a situation that warranted such a condemnation and warning, whereas the situation in which he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) announced he was the Sayyid (of mankind) was due to the fact that he was talking about his (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) intercession. So he was clarifying its reality the reality that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we are trying to make here is: Sending Salaat on the Prophet should be done by using one of the versions that have been reported in the texts. You should not add the phrase Sayyidina (our leader) to it even though the Prophet is our Sayyid. I hope that this point is understood. Furthermore, after making this point clear, I would like to reiterate that we must believe and affirm, in accordance with his report, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our Sayyid (leader). However, when sending Salaat upon him, we should not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa.&#8221; Rather we should just say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; since this would be following his example, implementing his teachings, and carrying out his instructions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement stuns some people, which is why I must say again that the scholars have unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for a Muslim who wants to worship Allaah through words of supplication that have been reported in the texts to add, subtract, change or replace any of those words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth, with their intricate memory and understanding of the texts, use as evidence one single report, which others perhaps are not aware of the basis of proof found in it. This report is about the time when the Prophet taught one of his Companions the supplication one should make when going to bed. The supplication contains the following words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Aamantu bi-Kitaabik aladhee anzalta wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;<br />
I believe in Your Book that You revealed and in Your Prophet that You sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion began to repeat this supplication in order to memorize it, but then on one occasion, said: &#8220;&#8230;wa Rasoolik aladhee arsalta&#8221; , i.e. &#8220;&#8230;in Your Messenger that You sent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he do? He replaced the word &#8220;Nabee&#8221; (Prophet) with the word &#8220;Rasool&#8221; (Messenger). This Companion then narrated that: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), tapped my chest and said: &#8220;No, say: Wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear proof that it is not proper for a person who wishes to follow Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and abide by his teachings to add, subtract, change or replace (these supplications) based on his own accord. The &#8220;Messenger&#8221; and &#8220;Prophet&#8221; are two valid titles for Prophet Muhammad. However, we cannot change the supplication from the manner in which it was reported since that is the way the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) stated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) does not speak from his own desire. So these were revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) through revelation from Allaah. Meaning: The legislation of these words of remembrance that are to be said at the time of sleeping came down from the heavrns. So if something was revealed to the Prophet(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and he conveyed it to his, Companions in the same manner in which it was sent down, it would not be proper for the Companions to change that. And we should follow their example, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, there occurs the opening supplication, which is optional, and states: <strong>&#8220;Subhaanak Allaahumma wa bi Hamdika. Wa Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka. Wa Laa ilaaha Ghayruka.&#8221;</strong> [Free from imperfections are You, O Allaah, and all praise is Yours. Blessed is Your Name, Glorified be Your Greatness, and there is no deity worthy of worship besides You]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of &#8220;<strong>Subhaanak Allaahumma</strong>&#8221; is: I absolve You from all imperfections in a manner that befits Your majesty. &#8220;<strong>Wa bi-Hamdika</strong>&#8221; i.e. while praising You. &#8220;<strong>Wa Tabaarakasmuka</strong>&#8221; i.e. blessing can be attained by mentioning You. &#8220;<strong>Wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka</strong>&#8221; i.e. Glorified be Your Greatness. &#8220;<strong>Wa Laa ilaaha Ghayruka</strong>&#8221; i.e. There is nothing that has the right to be worshipped on earth or in heaven except You, O Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>~ the explanation ~</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author, may Allaah have mercy on him, states here that the opening supplication is a recommended act. It is neither a pillar nor a requirement nor a condition. Rather it is supererogatory. He then went on to choose one version of the opening supplication, which is the shortest, amplest, and most comprehensive of these supplications from the perspective of praise, veneration and glorification of Allaah. And it is: <strong>&#8220;Subhaanak Allaahumma wa hi Hamdika. Wa Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka. Wa Laa Ilaaha Ghayruka</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim listed a number of opening supplications in his book Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad. But he preferred this supplication over the numerous other ones of this nature, some of which are longer. This is due to the fact that this concise supplication contains such praise, veneration and glorification for Allaah the likes of which cannot be found in other supplications. Other supplications consist more of requests and invocations whereas this one consists of (purely) glorification, honoring and exaltation (of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author then takes it upon himself to explain this supplication as well as what comes after it. The meaning of: &#8220;<strong>Subhaanak Allaahumma</strong>&#8221; is: &#8220;I absolve You, O Lord, in a manner that befits You, from all imperfections.&#8221;  This is an absolving that befits His majesty, and it is derived from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided in their definitions of absolving Allaah from imperfections. Some people have defined it as negating Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, which is why the <strong>Jahmiyyah and Mu&#8217;tazilah</strong> have negated all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, claiming that they are removing imperfections from Allaah. The reason for this (according to them) is because if one affirms Attributes for Allaah, this leads to likening Allaah to His creation. So, according to them, freeing Allaah from imperfections can only be achieved by negating His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>Ashaa&#8217;irah and the Matooridiyyah</strong> did the same with respect to the textual Attributes. The textual Attributes are those attributes for which the intellect plays no part in affirming. They are only affirmed by way of narrations and textual proofs. According to the understanding of the Ashaa&#8217;irah, affirming these attributes literally goes against removing imperfections from Allaah. So as a result they resorted to <strong>taweel</strong> (misinterpretation). They did not negate the Attributes as others did. Rather, they claimed that what was literally stated in these texts was not what Allaah intended. So therefore, interpreting them them with other than their literal meanings is binding based on the claim of removing imperfections from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will notice that everyone who negates or distorts the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes claims to be removing imperfections from Allaah by what they do. When the first group negated Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, they did not intend disrespect for Allaah. Rather, according to their claim, they only intended to remove imperfections from Him. But where is this removal of imperfections? They went astray in this regard. Why did they go astray? Because they looked for guidance in other than Allaah&#8217;s Book. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever searches for guidance in other than the Book of Allaah and in other than what the Messenger brought, will no doubt go astray</span>. <strong>This is a principle</strong>. Whoever looks for guidance and truth in other than what the Messenger of Allaah came with will be misguided as recompense for turning away (from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah). This is since guidance, correctness and truth is restricted to only that which the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we want to know the true manner of removing Allaah, from imperfections in a manner that befits His majesty, we should read Allaah&#8217;s statement: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing like Him (in comparison), and He is the All Hearer, the All-Seer</span>.&#8221; [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is there a greater example of removing imperfections from Allaah than this? Allaah affirms Attributes for Himself but negates any comparisons in those Attributes that He has affirmed. This is what is meant by <strong>tanzeeh</strong> (removing imperfections from Allaah). It is that you affirm for Him what He has affirmed for Himself from complete Attributes, perfect Names and flawless Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affirm for Him what He has affirmed for Himself. Then negate any comparisons to what He has affirmed (for Himself) since no one can describe Allaah who is more knowledgeable than Him. Also affirm for what His trusted Messenger has described Him with and negate my comparisons to what he (peace be upon him) has affirmed, since no one can describe Allaah from His creation who is more knowledgeable than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how Allaah has guided the people of truth and the callers to truth. So they know how to remove imperfections from Allaah without negating His Attributes, distorting their meaning, making comparisons to them or likening them to His creation. This is the point the author is trying to make when he says: &#8220;I absolve You from all imperfections, my Lord, in a manner that befits You.&#8221; This is the type of removing of imperfections from Allaah that befits His majesty, which has been derived from the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa bi-Hamdika&#8221;</strong> means: &#8220;while praising You.&#8221; So this consists of removing imperfections from Allaah while at the same time praising Him. But on the other hand, if you have negated Allaah&#8217;s Perfect Attributes, how can you then praise Him?! If you have negated the Attribute of Mercy from Allaah, how can you praise Him? You say that it is impossible for Allaah to have Mercy and that Love is something impossible for Allaah. He is neither loved nor does He love. How then can you praise him when you negate Mercy from Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You heard previously the qudsee hadeeth about Al-Faatihah in which it is stated: &#8220;And when the servant says: <strong>Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem</strong>&#8216;, Allaah says: &#8216;<strong>My servant has extolled Me</strong>.&#8221; As for the one who negates the Attribute of Mercy from Allaah, it is not possible for Him to praise Allaah, since praising Allaah can only be achieved through His exemplary Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa Tabaarakusmuka&#8221;</strong> means: Blessing is achieved by mentioning You. Your Name is removed from any imperfections and blessing is achieved through mention of Your Name. This is how the author (Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab) has explained it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa Ta&#8217;aala jadduka&#8221;</strong> means: Glorified be Your greatness grandness. The word &#8220;<strong>jadd</strong>&#8221; here takes on the meaning of grandness and self sufficiency. So it means: &#8220;Glorified be Your Grandness and self-sufficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that: &#8220;No one on earth or in heaven is worshipped with due right except for You, O Allaah.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;<strong>with due right</strong>&#8221; must be mentioned when explaining the meaning of &#8220;Laa Ilaaha illaaAllaah&#8221;. You must include &#8220;due right&#8221; or &#8220;rightfully&#8221; or else the meaning will be wrong. If you were to say: &#8220;There is no one worshipped in the heavens or on the earth except for You&#8221; we would be contradicting reality since those who are worshipped are many. But the one who is worshipped after all others have been negated is the One who is worshipped in truth or with &#8220;due right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one worshipped on earth or in heaven with due right except for You. As for those who are worshipped in the heavens and the earth, the worship of them is futile and invalid. The sun and the moon are worshipped but worshiping them is invalid. Trees are worshipped. Many of the large trees with many branches (known as dawhaat) are still worshipped today. This goes also for stones, tombs and shrines. The worship of these things is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also applies to the worship of Jinn and the worship of graves. Every time something is worshipped, it becomes known as a &#8220;god&#8221; according to the language. It is not called Allaah, but rather a &#8220;false&#8221; god. The term &#8220;god&#8221; is general and encompasses the One who is worshipped with due right as well as those that are worshipped wrongfully. The word &#8220;Allaah&#8221; is specifically reserved for the One who is worshipped with due right &#8211; the Creator of the heavens and the earth. There is no one worshipped in the heavens or the earth (with due right) except for you, O Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">By Shaykhul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated &amp; Compiled  by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wasallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ذَاقَ طَعْمَ الإيمانِ : مَنْ رَضِيَ بالله ربًّا، وبالإسلام دينًا، وبمحمَّدٍ رَسُولاً</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The <strong>sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em></strong> has been tasted by he, whomever is pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Islaam as a religion and Muhammad as a Messenger.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">مَنْ قَالَ حِيْنَ يَسْمَعُ النِّدَاءَ رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا، وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ رَسُولاً، وَبِالإِسْلاَمِ دِينًا. غُفِرَ لَهُ ذَنْبُهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Whoever says, when he hears the call to prayer, I am pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger and Islaam as a religion, then his sin will be forgiven.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The levels of the religion revolve around these two <em>Ahadeeth</em> and they end with these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed these two <em>Ahadeeth</em> include being pleased with the <strong><em>Ruboobeeyah</em> </strong>(Lordship) of Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em>, and His <strong><em>Ulooheeyah</em> </strong>(worshipping Him), being <strong>pleased</strong> with His Messenger and having <strong>obedience</strong> to him, and being <strong>pleased</strong> with Allaah&#8217;s religion and having <strong>submission</strong> to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>four aspects</strong></span> combined, then he truly is a <strong><em>Siddeeq</em> </strong>(truthful) person. It is an easy claim and statement to say, but it is from the most difficult matters in reality and in being tested, especially if what occurs opposes the desires of the soul and the intent of that becomes clear that being pleased was stated with just the tongue, so it was upon the tongue and not with ones actions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Therefore, being pleased with Allaah&#8217;s <strong><em>Ieelaheeya</em> </strong>(meaning the One who is worshipped):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">includes being pleased with loving Him alone, being fearful of Him, having hope in Him, and turning repentantly to Him, and having devotion for Him,  andstrength of intention and having all love for Him,  the person being pleased does everything to please his beloved, and this includes His worship and having sincerity for Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Being pleased with His Ruboobeeyah (Lordship):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes being pleased with what Allaah has planned and disposed for His slave. Being pleased with Allaah&#8217;s <em>Ruboobeeyah</em> also includes singling Allaah out alone for having trust and reliance upon Him, and seeking assistance with Him, trusting Him, having reliance upon Him, and that a person is pleased with everything that Allaah does to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: includes being pleased with what He commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: includes being pleased with what He destined for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many people who are pleased with Allaah as a Lord and they do not desire any other Lord except Him, however, they are not pleased with Him with being the only <em>Wali</em> (Guardian) and being the only Helper. But they have loyalty to <em>Awaliyah</em> other than Allaah, thinking that they are bringing you closer to Allaah, and that being loyal to them is like being loyal to those who are close to the king, and this is specific Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Tawheed is that a person does not take any one other than Allaah as an <em>Awaliyah</em>, and the Qur&#8217;aan is full of the description of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> that they took <em>Awaliyah</em> other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not the loyalty that one has for Allaah&#8217;s Prophets, His Messengers and His believing slaves, since this is from the completion of <em>Eemaan</em> to have loyalty to His Prophets, and this is in fact complete loyalty for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, having loyalty for His <em>Awaliyah</em> is one colour and taking a <em>Wali</em> other than Allaah is a different colour. Whoever has not understood the distinction and criterion between them, then he must study Tawheed from its foundation, since this issue is a foundation of Tawheed and its base principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many people who desire to take someone other than Allaah as a judge to whom they can take their judgements to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With whom they could debate, and be pleased with his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three levels are the pillars of Tawheed; that none other than Allah is taken as a Lord, or as a deity and none other than Him has a command.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Being pleased with His Prophet:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for being pleased with His Prophet as a Messenger: then this includes having prefect obedience to him, and complete submission to him, whereby the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; is foremost to a person than his own self.  So he does not take guidance except from the places of the Messenger&#8217;s speech,  he does not turn for a judgement except to him, and no one gives a judgement above his,  and he totally is not pleased with someone else&#8217;s judgement, not in anything from the <em>Asmaa</em> (Names) of Allaah and His characteristics and His actions, nor in anything from the perception and sense of the reality of <em>al</em> <em>Eemaan</em> and its different  levels,  nor in anything from the <em>Ahkam</em> (rulings) apparent and hidden, and a person is not pleased with a ruling regarding these things from someone other than the Messenger, and he is not pleased except with his ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If however a person is incapable of following the Messenger&#8217;s judgement, then him having someone else&#8217;s judgement then this is from the view of forceful nourishment for a person who cannot find that which would sustain himself with except from dead flesh and blood.  The best that can be said about this situation is that it is like using dust, which is used for <em>Tayummum</em> (dry ablution) when a person is incapable of using water for purification.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Being pleased with His Deen (Religion):</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for being pleased with the <em>Deen</em>, so if the <em>Deen</em> says something or gives a ruling or commands or prohibits then a person should be completely pleased with it. There does not remain any opposition and resistance in his heart from its ruling, and he submits to it with total submission.  Even if it opposes what his own self intends, or his desires, or the statement of the one whom he blindly follows, or his Shaykh or his sect, this is where all the people desert you except the <em>Ghuraba</em> (those who adhere to the <em>Sunnah</em>) in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware of feeling distressed and lonely of being isolated and alone [i.e. Since the people abandon you for holding on to the Sunnah, being from the <em>Ghuraba</em>.]  since indeed it is -and I swear by Allaah- the distinction of honour and companionship with Allaah and His Messenger and it is the soul of being close to Allaah.  And being pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger and Islaam as a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ 2/170-172]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Different Wordings of the Hadeeth</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; From Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri saying that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahualayhiwasallam–</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(مَنْ قَالَ: رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ نَبِيًّا وَجَبَتْ لَهُ الْجَنَّةُ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet, then Paradise becomes obligatory for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in SilsilahSaheehah 334 &amp;Saheeh Abu Dawood 1368]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 &#8211; From Aamir bin Sa’ad bin Abee Waqas from his father from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahualayhiwasallam –</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(مَنْ قَالَ حِينَ يَسْمَعُ الْمُؤَذِّنَ: وَأَنَا أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَسُولًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says when he hears the <em>Mu’adhin</em> (the caller to the prayer): <em>Wa Ana Ashhaduanala  </em><em>ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareekalahu wa Ashhaduanna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu Radeetu Billaahi Rabban wa BilIslaami Deenan wa Bi Muhammad </em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam Rasoolan.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, with Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Messenger’) Then his previous sins are forgiven.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh Abu Dawood 537]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; From al-Munaydhir a Companion of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he used to be in Africa who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قال إذا أصبح :&#8221; رضيت بالله ربا و بالإسلام دينا و بمحمد نبيا &#8220;،فأناالزعيم لآخذن بيده حتى أدخله الجنة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says in the morning: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet,’ then I am a guarantor that I will indeed definitely take him by his hand until I can enter him in to Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in At-Targheeb by al-Mundhari, Tabarani &amp; Albaani in Silsilah Saheehah 2686 and he said the Hadeeth is <em>Thaabit</em> (Established)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ayni said in his explanation of Abu Dawood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord’ means: I am convinced by Him, He is sufficient for me, and I do not require anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying:  ‘and with Muhammad as the Prophet,’ means: that I am content with Muhammad as a Messenger to me and to all the other Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying:  ‘Islaam as the Religion’ means: I am content with Islaam as a religion, meaning I do not desire another way other than Islaam, and I do not follow except that which is in agreement with the <em>Sharia’</em> of Muhammad <em>– alayhi as-Salaam-</em> or that I do not desire other than Islaam as a <em>Deen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[SharhAbeeDawood by al-Ayani 2/484]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ayni continues in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said what is the intent of the saying: ‘as a <em>Deen’</em>, I say: the meaning of <em>Deen</em> here is Tawheed; … . . as in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومَنيَبتَغ غَيرَ الإِسلاَم دينا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam&gt;&gt;[Ala-Imran: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Means: Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> from Umar who said: ‘While we were with the Messenger of Allaah that day, all of a sudden a man came to visit whose clothing was exceedingly white…..’ to the end of the <em>hadeeth</em>. So here the Messenger of Allaah generalized the ‘<em>Deen’</em> upon ‘Islaam, <em>Eemaan</em> (faith) and <em>Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship)’  due to his saying: Indeed that was Jibraeel who came to you to teach you your <em>Deen</em>.’ He taught them these three things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sometimes the <em>Deen</em> is stated for the three things which Jibraeel <em>– Alayhi as-Salaam –</em> inquired about, and sometimes it is stated for Islaam as is in the saying of Allaah Tala’a:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">اليَومَ أكمَلتُ لَكُم دينَكُم وَأتمَمتُ عَلَيكم نعمَتيوَرَضيتُ لَكُمُ الإسلاَمَ دينا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&gt;&gt;[al-Maidah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘SharhAbeeDawood’ by al-Ayani 2/486-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Saying it three times is not Authentic</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong><strong> &#8211; </strong>From Abee Salaam the servant of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no Muslim or human or slave who says when the morning comes and when the evening approaches, <strong>three times</strong>: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet, except that it is a right upon Allaah that he will please him on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’ and in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Albaani declared it <strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong> in Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah no. 5020]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong><strong> &#8211; </strong>‘who says when the morning comes and when the evening approaches, <strong>three times</strong>: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet.’ except that it is a right upon Allaah that he will please him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Albaani declared it <strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong> in ‘Da’eef al-Jamia’ as-Sagheer’ No. 5734]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">[ This hadith was transmitted by Sahih Muslim]<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbâs reports that he once stayed the night as a guest of Maymûna, who was his aunt, and the Prophet, may Allâh bless him and grant him peace. They slept on their blanket lengthways, and he slept at the end, crossways. After they had all slept for a while, the Prophet rose in the middle of the night to pray the tahajjud prayer, and Ibn ‘Abbas joined him.</p>
<p>They both did wudû’, and he prayed eleven rak&#8217;ats with the Prophet. Then they both went back to sleep again until dawn. Bilâl called the adhân and the Prophet did another two short rak’ats, before going into the mosque to lead the Dawn Prayer.</p>
<p>Ibn ‘Abbâs said that one of the du’âs that the Prophet made during this night was:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b> ( from Rites of Hajj and Umrah &#8211; by Shaik Nasiruddin Albanee )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;<strong>This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door</strong>. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed, although it was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (i.e. that was not narrated in a saheeh hadeeth, as the ahaadeeth that were narrated concerning this were deemed to be da’eef or weak). Rather it was narrated from some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). So is iltizaam (clinging) Sunnah? When should it be done – upon arrival or when about to leave, or at any time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this difference of opinion among the scholars is that it is not narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to do that when they arrived in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fuqaha’ said: He (the pilgrim) should do that when about to leave, and should cling to the multazam, which is the area between the corner where the Black Stone is located and the door…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, there is nothing wrong with iltizaam (clinging to the Ka’bah in this area) so long as that does not involve annoying others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/402, 403.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would supplicate:<i> &#8220;O Allaah! I ask You for guidance, piety, safety and well-being, and contentment and sufficiency.&#8221;</i> [<b><i>Allaahumma innee as&#8217;alukal-hudaa wat-tuqaa wal-&#8216;afaafa wal-ghinaa</i></b>].1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is from the most comprehensive and beneficial <i>du&#8217;aas</i> (supplications), since it includes asking Allaah for well-being with regards to both the Religion and the world. Thus, <i>al-hudaa</i> (the guidance) is beneficial knowledge, and <i>at-tuqaa </i>(i.e. <i>taqwaa</i> or piety) is righteous actions and leaving-off what Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden; and this is (asking) for correctness and well-being of a person&#8217;s Religion. For indeed, the Religion comprises of beneficial knowledge and recognising the truth &#8211; which is guidance &#8211; and standing firm upon obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; and this is piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>al-&#8216;afaafa</i> (well-being and safety) and <i>al-ghinaa</i> (contentment and sufficiency) comprises of being safe from (the harms of) the creation and that the heart is not attached to them. And it also comprises of being contented with Allaah and what He provides, and seeking whatever will cause the heart to be satisfied with Him. So with this, happiness in this worldly life is completed, and the heart tastes true sweetness and delight &#8211; and this is a goodly life. So whosoever is granted the provisions of guidance, Piety. well-being and contentment has indeed achieved true happiness, and has acquired all that could be possibly sought after, as well as being saved from all that is dreadful and frightening.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWLEDGE AND HUMILITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever seeks knowledge for actions, then his knowledge makes him humble and fearful, and causes him to weep at (the deficiencies in) himself. But whosoever seeks knowledge for the sake of merely teaching, giving verdicts, in order to brag, or to show-off; becomes foolish, arrogant and looks down in contempt at the people, and is destroyed by pride, and the people hate him. <b>&#8220;Truly he succeeds who purifies his soul, and he fails who corrupts it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shams 99:4-5]. Meaning that it is corrupted with sin and disobedience.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>REMEMBERING THE GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaadee &#8216;Iyaadh (d.591H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; relates: &#8220;Mu&#8217;sab ibn &#8216;Abdullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Maalik (d.179H) would mention the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his colour would change and he would have to lean down, and those in his gathering would feel disturbed. So one day, on being asked about this, he said: If you had seen what I have seen, you would not have rejected what you had seen. I have seen Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir (d.130H) &#8211; and he was the leader of the Reciters &#8211; that he would never be asked about a <i>hadeeth</i> (Prophetic narration), except that he would weep, until we had mercy upon him. And I have seen Ja&#8217;far ibn Muhammad (d.148H) who used to smile alot. Yet whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would turn pale. I have never seen him narrating the <i>hadeeth</i> of the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, except in a state of purification. And when times deteriorated, I never saw him except in one of three conditions: Either Praying, observing silence, or reciting the Qur&#8217;aan. He never uttered a word having no significance, and he was one of the Scholars and worshippers who had great fear of Allaah. Whenever &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim (d.126H) mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, he turned pale, as if the blood had been drained from his face, and his tongue dried-up due to reverence for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. I went to &#8216;Aamir ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn az-Zubayr (d.123H), and whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would weep so much, until he was unable to weep any longer. I saw az-Zuhree (d.124H) &#8211; and he was from the kindest of people, and closest to them &#8211; that when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would not be able to recognise you, nor would you be able to recognise him. I came to Safwaan ibn Sulaym (d.132H) &#8211; and he was one of the <i>mujtahid</i> Scholars and worshippers &#8211; that whenever he mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> he would weep, and he would not stop weeping, to the extent that the people would have to get up and leave him.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the likes of such weeping souls that we have inherited the knowledge of our Religion!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong><strong> Why the Devil is called Shaytan ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned&#8217;), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, &#8220;The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,&#8217; when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan).&#8221; Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan&#8217;. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I asked him , `Are there human devils&#8217; He said, (Yes.)&#8221; Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I said, `What is the difference between the black dog and the red or yellow dog&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The black dog is a devil.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, &#8220;By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2] What does Isti`adhah mean</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[4] The Meaning of Ar-Rajim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rajim means, being expelled from all types of righteousness. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps Rujuman (as missiles) to drive away the Shayatin (devils)) (67:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness) (37:6-10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several similar Ayat. It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people&#8217;s hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Virtues of the Isti`adhah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah&#8217;s help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant&#8217;s meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy &#8211; Satan &#8211; become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy &#8211; disbelievers &#8211; gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[6] Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur&#8217;an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur&#8217;an. In support of `Ata&#8217;s statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.&#8221; Then this will suffice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Seeking Refuge before reciting the Qur&#8217;an</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).) meaning, before you recite the Qur&#8217;an. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms)) (5:6) meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir (saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;; Allah is Greater) and would then supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks. Blessed be Your Name, Exalted be Your sovereignty, and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say thrice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge with Allah, the Hearing, the Knowing, from the cursed Satan, from his coercion, lures to arrogance and poems.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The four collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi considered the most famous Hadith on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said that his father said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah started the prayer, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Greater, truly the Greatest (thrice); all praise is due to Allah always (thrice); and all praise is due to Allah day and night (thrice). O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed Satan, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.).&#8221; `Amr said, &#8220;The Hamz means asphyxiation, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221; Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata&#8217; bin As-Sa&#8217;ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, &#8220;Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;) They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying&#8217; He said, `I am not insane.&#8221;&#8217; Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> </b>1 – Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr al-Assqalani (d.852 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the statement: ‘The saying of Allaah Azza wa Jal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدۡنِي عِلۡمٗا</p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Rabbi Zidni Ilma&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;O my Lord increase me in knowledge&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clear proof of the Excellence of knowledge. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is because Allaah Ta’ala did not order the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> with request for increase in anything except for an increase in knowledge.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Fath al-Bari’ 1/141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">2 – Umm Salma <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radhi Allaahu anha</i><i>&#8211;</i> said, the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to say in the supplication in the morning prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">اللهم إني أسألك علماً نافعاً، ورزقاً طيباً، وعملاً متقبلاً</p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Allaahumma innee assaluka ilman nafia, wa rizzqan tayyeebun, wa amalan mutaqabilan,.’</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘O Allaah indeed I ask You for beneficial knowledge, and a good <i>Halal</i> provision, and actions which are accepted.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">[Collected by Tayalisee, Tabraani &amp; regarded Hasan by Hafidh Ibn Hajr]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">3 – From Anas bin Malik <i>&#8211; Radi Allaahu anhu –</i> that he heard the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> supplicating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">اللهم انفعني بما علمتني وعلمني ما ينفعني وارزقني علما تنفعني به</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allahumman fa’nee bi-maa ‘allam-ta-nee wa ‘allim-nee maa yanfa’u-nee war zuq-nee ‘ilman yanfa’u-nee</strong></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">[Collected by al-Hakim, Bayhaqi, Tabraani &amp; authenticated by Albaani in Silsilah No. 3151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">4 – Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِي ٱلدُّنۡيَا حَسَنَةٗ وَفِي ٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ حَسَنَةٗ وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&lt;&lt; O our Lord give us good in this <i>Dunyaa</i>, and good in the Hereafter and save us from the punishment of the fire  &gt;&gt;</strong> </span>[2:201]</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;" align="left">Al-Hasan said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<i>al-Hasana</i> (good) in the <i>Dunyaa</i> is knowledge and worship, and in the Hereafter it is Paradise.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;" align="left">Sufyan said: ‘<i>al-Hasana</i> (good) in the <i>Dunyaa</i> is knowledge and good provision, and in the Hereafter Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">[From: ‘Lattaif al-Ma’arif p.302]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">5 – Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Jafar said: ‘I heard Ibn Khuzaimah while he was asked: ‘Where did you get this knowledge from?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">He answered: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">ماء زمزم لما شرب له</p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘<i>Zam Zam</i> water is what it is drank for.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="left">So, when I would drink <i>Zam Zam</i> water <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I would ask Allaah for beneficial knowledge.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">[From: ‘Tadhkiratul Huffadh’ 2/721]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Al-Hakim said: ‘I drank <i>Zam Zam</i> water and I asked Allaah that he grant me the ability to compile works of books in a good way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">[From: ‘Tadhkiratul Huffadh’ 3/1044]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr said: ‘Once I drank <i>Zam Zam</i>, and I supplicated to Allaah, at that time I was at the beginning of studying Hadeeth, I asked Allaah to grant me the status of Dhahabi in memorising Hadeeth.  Twenty years later I went to perform Hajj, and I found in myself the ability to surpass that rank, so I asked Allaah for a higher rank than before, and I hope that Allaah grants me that rank.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">[From: ‘Juz hadeeth (Mau Zam Zam lema shuriba lahu)’ p.191 &#8211; 192]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reality of the issue is that a slave of Allaah is in dire need of asking someone for knowledge and guidance, seeking and asking, then he remembers Allaah and of his dire need of Allaah, then Allaah guides and shows him.  Just as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">يا عبادي كلكم ضال إلا من هديته فاستهدوني أهدكم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘O My worshippers! All of you are astray except the one whom I have guided, so seek guidance from Me and I will guide you.’</span><br />
[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left">And just as the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ جَبْرَائِيلَ وَمِيكَائِيلَ وَإِسْرَافِيلَ. فَاطِرَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ. عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ. أَنْتَ تَحْكُمُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ. اهْدِنِي لِمَا اخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِكَ إِنَّكَ تَهْدِي مَنْ تَشَاءُ إِلَى صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘O Allaah, Lord of Jibraeel, Mikael and Israfeel, You are the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One who has all knowledge of the unseen and what is visible.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam &#8211; The <strong>salaah</strong> and <strong>salaam</strong> of Allaah be upon His Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>salaah</strong> of Allaah upon Prophet Muhammad is His Praise of the Prophet before the angels who are close to (but below) Allaah, the Most High, who istawaa (ascended) upon His &#8216;Arsh (Throne), which is above the seven heavens, in a manner that suits His Majesty. The angels also praise the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>salaam</strong> is Allaah’s safeguarding of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam) from deficiencies and any kind of evil, and the protection of the Message with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim says &#8220;sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam&#8221;, he invokes Allaah to grant His Praise and Security to Prophet Muhammad and the protection of the Message of Islam which was revealed to him (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam).</p>

<p>Also mentioned in Hisn al Muslim &#8211; Sahih At-Tirmidhi 3/142 and AbuDawood.<br />
Also mentioned  in  Saheeh Al-Kalimaat At-Tayyib &#8211;  Hadeeth No # 21</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The following notes has been taken from  &#8220;<span style="color:#666699;">More than 1000 Sunan Every Day &amp; Night</span>&#8221; published by Dar-us-Salaam</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(*)</span> There are two opinions on how this should be pronounced:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The first opinion is that the word should be pronounced as <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shiraki</span>, which means plots and plans. So, this part of the supplication would read, &#8220;<em>I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul and from the evil and plans of Shaytaan</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The second opinion, which seems to be the strongest, is that it should be pronounced as <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shirki</span>; this refers to whatever the Shaytaan is calling you towards, in terms of acts of worship, which result in associating partners with Allah. It doesn&#8217;t meant that Shirk is being commited by Shaytaan himself. On the contrary it is the person who commits the shirk in obedienec to Shaytaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For a more detailed explanation, refer to TuhfatAl-Ahwadee, Volume 9, Hadeeth 3452, by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Mubaarakpuri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(**)</span> Shaykh Al-Albanee mentioned that the last part,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..is from another narration is Sunan At-Tirmidhi, narrated by Abdullah bin Ammaar, and is not mentioned as part of this supplication, which is also from Sunan At-Tirmidhee, but narrated by Aboo Hurayrah.</p>

<span style="color:#808080;">al-Shaykh ‘Abd al- ‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Vol. 11, pp. 188-190 &#8211; <a style="color:#808080;" href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1804&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></span></p>
<p>From ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin ‘Abdullah Ibn Baz to those who receive this among Muslims. May Allah guide all Muslims and increase their knowledge and faith, amen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!) It gives me pleasure to remind my Muslim brothers that &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is of the Sunnah for a Muslim to say after each obligatory Salah, whether one is the Imam (the one who leads the congregational Salah), Ma&#8217;mum (a person being led by an Imam in Prayer) or Mufarid (a person who performs prayer alone) to say, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>three times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>أَسْـتَغْفِرُ الله </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><br />
&#8220;Astagfir Allah&#8221; </strong></span>[#1]<br />
(I ask Allah forgiveness)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> and then say,</p>
<p><strong>اللّهُـمَّ أَنْـتَ السَّلامُ ، وَمِـنْكَ السَّلام ، تَبارَكْتَ يا ذا الجَـلالِ وَالإِكْـرام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahumma Anta Al-Salam Wa Minka Al-Salam, Tabarakta Wa Ta’alayta Ya-dhal-Jalali Wal-Ikram&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">[#1]</span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(O Allah, You are Al-Salam [the One Who is free from all defects and deficiencies] and from You is all peace, blessed are You, Possessor of majesty and honor!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one is Imam, one should turn facing the people. The Imam, those praying behind him, or a person offering Salah individually should say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, alone, without any partner. To Allah belong all sovereignty and praise. He is Omnipotent over all things.

None has the right to be worshipped except Allah and we are sincere in faith and devotion to Him although disbelievers detest it. Oh Allah! Oh Allah! None can prevent what You willed to give and none can grant what You have willed to prevent, and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone, as from You is all wealth and majesty).</p>
<p>After offering Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer and Fajr (Dawn) Prayer one should say along with what is mentioned previously,</p>
<p>After completing the prayer:</p>
<p><strong>لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحَدْهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in Qadeer</strong></span></p>
<p>[None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, Who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise . He brings life and He causes death , and He is Able to do all things.]</p>
<p>After that, one is to say each of the following supplications <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>thirty three times</strong></span>;</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Subhana Allah&#8221; </strong></span>(Glory is to Allah),</p>
<p><strong>(b) &#8220;</strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; </strong></span>(praise is due to Allah) and</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; </strong></span>(Allah is the Great),</p>
<p>and then <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>complete the hundred</strong></span> by saying,</p>
<p><strong>لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحَدْهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in Qadeer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended for the Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite these supplications <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>audibly</strong> </span>after each obligatory Salah in a low voice without disturbing others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported in the two Sahih on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>that raising one&#8217;s voice in supplication after concluding the obligatory Salah was during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;I used to know when they finished the Salah by this (supplications as they were said aloud) if I heard them.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on Adhan, no. 841; Muslim, Sahih, Book on Masjids and places for Salah, no. 583; Al-Nasaa&#8217;y, Sunan, Book on Sujud-ul-Sahw, no. 1335; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 1003; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 1, p. 367.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not permissible to say these supplications collectively</span>. Each worshipper should recite them individually without observing the voice of others, because reciting supplications collectively is Bid’ah and has no basis in the divine Shari’ah (law) of Allah.</p>
<p>It is recommended for Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span> (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Foot stool, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255<strong>)  </strong>[#3]  <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>inaudibly</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Iklas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 112),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Falaq </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 113), and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Nas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 114)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">inaudibly</span> </strong>after each obligatory Salah and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>repeat them three times</strong> after the Maghrib (Sunset) and Fajr (Dawn) Salahs</span>. [#4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is preferable, for the authenticity of what we have mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, His companions, and those who follow him rightfully till the Day of Judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Source : Tafseer Ibn Kathir of Surah Al-Kahf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> And never say of anything, &#8220;I shall do such and such thing tomorrow.&#8221; Except (with the saying), &#8220;If Allah wills!&#8221; And remember your Lord when you forget and say: &#8220;It may be that my Lord guides me to a nearer way of truth than this.&#8221;</span> &#8211; Surah Kahf: (23, 24 ayah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) declared Allah&#8217;s Oneness and proclaimed to be the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and revelation of Divine Message, the disbeliveers of Makkah sent some men to Jewish rabbis in al-Medina and said: &#8220;Ask them (the rabbis) about Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam), and describe him to them, and tell them what he is saying.They are the people of the first Book, and they have more knowledge of the Prophets than we do.&#8217; So they set out for al-Medina, they asked the Jewish rabbis about the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). They described him to them and told them some of his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rabbis said: &#8216;Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story? For there is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who traveled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story? And ask him about he Ruh (soul or spirit) what is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.&#8217; So, the men came back to Makkah and said: &#8216;O people! We have come to you with a decisive solution which will put an end to the problem between you and Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). The Jewish rabbis told us to ask him about some matters,&#8217; and they told them what they were. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and said: &#8216;O Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) tell us,&#8217; and they asked him about the things they had been told to ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;I will tell you tomorrow about what you have asked me.&#8221; But he (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) did not say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) never spoke anything except with revelation. So, he waited for the revelation from Allah but fifteen days passed away without any revelation concerning those matter which the disbelievers asked, neither did Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) come to him. The people of Makkah started to doubt him and said: &#8216;Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) promised to tell us the next day and now fifteen days have gone by and he has not told us anything in response to the questions we asked.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) felt sad because of the delay in revelation and was grieved by what the people of Makkah were saying about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) came with the revelation of Soorah al-Kahf, which contained answers to the questions and also the above mentioned verse explaining the correct etiquette when determining to do something in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Determining to do something in the future should always be attributed to the Will of Allah, Who is the Knower of the Unseen and Who Alone Knows what was and what is yet to happen and what is not to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Abu Hurayrah (radhiyallahu anhu), who said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Sulaiman Ibn Dawood (alaihimus-salaam)</strong> said: &#8216;Tonight I will go around to all my seventy wives (according to some reports it is ninety or one hundred wives) so that each one of them will give birth to a son who will fight for the sake of Allah.&#8217; It was said to him, (according to one narration, an Angel said to him), say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217; But he did not say it. He went around to the women but none of them gave birth except for one, who gave birth to a half-formed child.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;By the One, in Whose Hands is my soul, had he said, &#8216;If Allah wills,&#8217; he would not have broken his oath, and that would have helped him to attain what he wanted.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (vol. 3, no. 1275)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if one determines to do something in the future or even takes an oath, he should say, &#8216;If Allah Wills&#8217; or &#8216;Insha&#8217;Allah.&#8217; If one forgets to say &#8220;Insha&#8217;Allah&#8221; then he should say when he remembers it even if it is a year later, as Ibn Abbas (radhiallahu anhu) explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Du`a&#8217; during Sujud for worldly matters</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Is it permissible to supplicate during Sujud (prostration) for worldly matters?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) for the praying person is to start Sujud with the Adhkar (invocations) reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Subhana Rabbiya Al-A`la</span></strong> (Glory be to my Lord, the Most High)&#8221; <span style="color:#0000ff;">ten times</span> as this is the perfect number of glorification. Scholars maintain that the less perfect number of glorification is three time, and what is sufficient is one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is supported by the evidence reported by the Five Compilers of Hadith (Imams Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah) save Al-Tirmidhy on the authority of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) in the Hadith about his Salah (Prayer) with the Prophet (peace be upon him) at night, in which he said: I offered Salah along with the Prophet (peace be upon him). In his Ruku` (bowing), he would say: &#8220;Subhana Rabbiya Al-`Azhim (Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great),&#8221; and in his Sujud, he would say: &#8220;Subhana Rabbiya Al-A`la.&#8221; It was reported on the authority of `Uqbah ibn `Amir that he said: When the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High, was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Make it in your Sujud.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence that the perfect number of glorification is ten times is what was reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y from Sa`id ibn Jubayr on the authority of Anas that he said: After the Messenger&#8217;s (peace be upon him) passing away, I have not prayed behind anyone whose Salah is more similar to the Messenger&#8217;s Salah (peace be upon him) than this boy, meaning `Umar ibn `Abdul-`Aziz. We estimated the number of the glorifications that he made during his Ruku` to be ten and in his Sujud also to be ten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if &#8211; after that &#8211; a person adds a Du`a&#8217; Ma&#8217;thur (supplication based on transmitted reports) or Adhkar prescribed in Sujud, this is good.</p>
<p>This includes saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Subbuhun quddusun Rabbul-mala’ikati war-ruh</span></strong> (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the Angels and the Ruh (Gabriel)&#8221;,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika. Allahumma ighfir li</span></strong> (Glory be to You, O Allah, our Lord, and praise be to You, O Allah, forgive me)&#8221;,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Allahumma ighfir li dhanbi kullahu, diqqahu wa-jillahu, wa-awwalahu wa-akhirahu, wa-`alaniyatahu wa-sirrahu</strong></span> (O Allah forgive me all my sins, slight and grave, first and last, open and secret thereof).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><span style="color:#666699;text-decoration:underline;">It is permissible for people to ask their Lord for whatever they need</span></strong></span>, as asking Allah and humiliating oneself to Him is in conformity with the meaning of Al-Uluhiyyah (Allah&#8217;s Exclusive Right to be worshipped) and answering the seekers accords with the meaning of Al-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Allah&#8217;s Lordship). Whenever a person perceives this, the light of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and Iman (faith/belief) will fill their hearts and they will resort to their Lord in all their worldly and religious affairs. In this case, a person is given glad tidings and should hope for the best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sujud is a position where Du`a&#8217; (supplication) is more likely to be answered, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: As for Sujud, strive hard in Du`a&#8217; therein because it is more likely that your Du`a&#8217; will be answered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Precious Gem: You are my Protector in this Life and in the Hereafter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">Source: Al-Fawaaid – A COLLECTION OF WISE SAYINGS – Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim,</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Rendered into English by: Bayan Translation Services</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Allah says that Yusuf (Joseph, peace be upon him) said, which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You are my Wali (Protector, Helper, Supporter, Guardian, etc.) in this world and in the Hereafter, cause me to die as a Muslim (the one submitting to Your Will), and join me with the righteous.&#8221; </span>(Yusuf, 12: 101)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">أَنتَ وَلِيِّي فِي الدُّنُيَا وَالآخِرَةِ تَوَفَّنِي مُسْلِمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anta waliyyee fid-dunya wal-akhirati tawaffanee musliman waalhiqnee bissaliheen </span>(Yusuf, 12: 101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This    supplication    combined    the    acknowledgment    of monotheism, submission to Allah, showing one&#8217;s need for Him, being free of taking any supporters other than Him, expressing that dying while being a Muslim is the greatest aim of any servant. This entails acknowledging that we are in the hands ofAllah and not in the hands of any servant, confessing the truth of the Resurrection, and asking to join with the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The below is take from Tafseer Ibn Kathir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yusuf begs Allah to die as A Muslim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the invocation of Yusuf, the truthful one, to his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored. He invoked Allah after His favor was complete on him by being reunited with his parents and brothers, after He had bestowed on him prophethood and kingship. He begged his Lord the Exalted and Ever High, that as He has perfected His bounty on him in this life, to continue it until the Hereafter. He begged Him that, when he dies, he dies as a Muslim, as Ad-Dahhak said, and to join him with the ranks of the righteous, with his brethren the Prophets and Messengers, may Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be on them all. It is possible that Yusuf, peace be upon him, said this supplication while dying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that `A&#8217;ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that while dying, the Messenger of Allah was raising his finger and said &#8211; thrice, ثَلَاثًا (<strong>O Allah to Ar-Rafiq Al-A`la</strong> ﴿the uppermost, highest company in heaven﴾.)</span> It is also possible that long before he died, Yusuf begged Allah to die as a Muslim and be joined with the ranks of the righteous.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawaa noor &#8216;ala adarb tape no321</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah extend your life! This is the questioner, Abu Abdullah, he says in the first question, If a person sees what amazes him, does he say Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah!), or Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah Laa Quwwata illah billah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah, there is no strength except with Allah) and are they all correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises are due to Allah, Lord of the worlds and prayer and salutation upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, his companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person sees that which amazes (pleases) him, pertaining to his wealth, then he should say <strong>Maashaa Allah Laa Quwwata illa billah</strong>, just as in the story of the companion of the two gardens, when his companion said to him: It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: That which Allah wills there is no power except with Allah. This is if he sees something amazing (pleasing) with his wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he sees it in other than himself then he should say <strong>Barakallahu Alaihi </strong>(May Allah bless it for him) or a statement similar to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he sees something that amazes (pleases) him from the matters of the Dunya (world) he should say: <strong>Labbaik, Innal Aish, Aishul Aakhirah</strong>, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam ) used to say. So he says Labbaik meaning an answer to you then he said verily the (real) life is the life of the hereafter. He makes it firm within himself at the same instance that the Dunya and whatever is within it does not remain and there is not any life in it but verily the real life is the life of the hereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us that He tests and tries His servants, just as He said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and As-Sabirin (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).)</strong> (47:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, He tests them with the bounty sometimes and sometimes with the afflictions of fear and hunger. Allah said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear.) (16:112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frightened and the hungry persons show the effects of the affliction outwardly and this is why Allah has used here the word `Libas&#8217; (cover or clothes) of fear and hunger. In the Ayat above, Allah used the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(with something of fear, hunger,) meaning, a little of each. Then (Allah said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(loss of wealth,) meaning, some of the wealth will be destroyed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lives) meaning, losing friends, relatives and loved ones to death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and fruits,) meaning, the gardens and the farms will not produce the usual or expected amounts. This is why Allah said next:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then explained whom He meant by `the patient&#8217; whom He praised:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</strong> meaning, those who recite this statement to comfort themselves in the face of their loss, know that they belong to Allah and that He does what He wills with His servants. They also know that nothing and no deed, even if it was the weight of an atom, will be lost with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. These facts thus compel them to admit that they are Allah&#8217;s servants and that their return will be to Him in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are those on whom are the Salawat (i. e., who are blessed and will be forgiven)</strong> from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy,) meaning, Allah&#8217;s praise and mercy will be with them. Sa`id bin Jubayr added, &#8220;Meaning, safety from the torment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and it is they who are the guided ones.)</strong> `Umar bin Al-Khattab commented: &#8220;What righteous things, and what a great heights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They are those on whom are the Salawat from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy) are the two righteous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and it is they who are the guided ones) are the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heights means more rewards, and these people will be awarded their rewards and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several Ahadith that mention the <strong>rewards of admitting</strong> that the return is to Allah by saying:(&#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;) when afflictions strike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, Imam Ahmad reported that Umm Salamah narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, Abu Salamah came back after he was with Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger recite a statement that made me delighted. He said:(No Muslim is struck with an affliction and then says Istirja` when the affliction strikes, and then says: `O Allah! Reward me for my loss and give me what is better than it,&#8217; but Allah will do just that.) Umm Salamah said: So I memorized these words. When Abu Salamah died I said Istirja` and said: &#8220;O Allah! Compensate me for my loss and give me what is better than it.&#8221; I then thought about it and said, &#8220;Who is better than Abu Salamah&#8221; When my `Iddah (the period of time before the widow or divorced woman can remarry) finished, Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked for permission to see me while I was dyeing a skin that I had. I washed my hands, gave him permission to enter and handed him a pillow, and he sat on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked me for marriage and when he finished his speech, I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! It is not because I do not want you, but I am very jealous and I fear that you might experience some wrong mannerism from me for which Allah would punish me. I am old and have children.&#8221; He said: (As for the jealousy that you mentioned, Allah the Exalted will remove it from you. As for your being old as you mentioned, I have suffered what you have suffered. And for your having children, they are my children too.) She said, &#8220;I have surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her and Umm Salamah said later, &#8220;Allah compensated me with who is better than Abu Salamah: Allah&#8217;s Messenger .&#8217; [ Muslim reported a shorter version of this Hadith]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Taken from the ‘Original <em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>‘</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">By<em> Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah ,</em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to say: ‘If one of you finishes from the [last] (1) <em>Tashahud</em>; then he should seek refuge (2) with Allaah from four things; [he says:<br />
‘O Allaah I seek refuge with You] from the punishment of the Hell-Fire, and from the punishment of the grave, and from the <em>Fitna</em> of life and death, and from the evil of the <em>Fitna</em> (trials) of the <em>Maseeh ad-Dajjal</em>.’ [then he makes <i>Dua’</i> for himself with that which appears apparent to him (3)] [He <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> would make <i>Dua’</i> with it in <i>Tashahud</i>] (4) [He <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to teach it to his Companions <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhum</i><i>&#8211;</i> just as he would teach them a <i>Soorah</i> from the <i>Qur’aan</i>.](5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>_________________</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albani’s footnotes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The benefit of this extra wording is the legislation of this ‘seeking refuge’ in the last <em>Tashahud</em> rather than the first <em>Tashahud</em>; this is in contrast to what Ibn Hazm said in ‘al-Muhalla’ (3/271) and Ibn Daqeeq al-Eid followed him in this, whereby he said: ‘The chosen way is to make <em>Dua’</em> in the first <em>Tashahud</em>, like making <em>Dua’</em> in the last <em>Tashahud</em>, due to the general authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you makes <em>Tashahud</em>; then he should seek refuge with Allaah from …’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Talkhees’ (3/507):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And he commented that it is in ‘as-Saheeh’ (al-Bukhari) from Abu Huriara with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you finishes from the last <em>Tashahud</em>; then he should seek refuge with Allaah from …’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim said in ‘Za’ad’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not seek refuge in the first <em>Tashahud</em> – from the punishment of the grave and punishment of the Fire …. Etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever recommended saying it, (in the last <em>Tashahud</em>) had understood this standing from the general texts, but the absolute texts indeed correctly clarified its position, and restricted it to the last <em>Tashahud</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Fath’ (2/253) after bringing the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So in this hadeeth this ‘seeking refuge’ is specified to after finishing the <em>Tashahud</em>; and this <em>Dua’</em> precedes all other <em>Duas</em>. As for when the person praying is given the permission to choose which <em>Dua’</em> he wants to supplicate with, then this is after the ‘seeking refuge’ and before giving the <em>Salams</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albani): ‘And the extra wording is at the end of the hadeeth – ‘then he makes <em>Dua’</em> for him-self with what he wants.’ And this is a text to show that seeking refuge is in the second <em>Tashahud</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) This shows clearly that <strong>seeking refuge is obligatory</strong> and some of the Ahl-ul-Dhahir hold this opinion – and from them is Ibn Hazm (3/271)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said (2/256):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Some of the people claimed that there is a consensus that it is not obligatory, however there is a problem with this; because AbdurRazaq narrated with an authentic <em>Isnaad</em> from Tawwoos, indicating that he holds the <strong>‘seeking refuge’ to be obligatory</strong>. This was when he asked his son; if he had said it after the <em>Tashahud</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his son replied: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawwoos ordered him to repeat the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albani): Indeed Muslim narrated this in his ‘Saheeh’ (2/94) as it came from Tawwoos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn Hazm was over generalizing when he said that you should also say it in the first <em>Tashahud</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mundhir said: if it was not for the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood whereby he narrated that: ‘then the person has a choice of what to make <em>Dua’</em> with’ then I would have said it was obligatory.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albani): This choice of making <em>Dua’</em> excludes ‘seeking refuge from these four things’, so due to the evidence this choice of making Dua’ becomes restricted, to be said after finishing ‘seeking refuge from these four things’ – has as preceded – ; <strong>so the truth is that it is obligatory, and Allaah knows best.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) From the hadeeth of Abu Huraira <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> collected by Muslim, Abu ‘Awaanah, Ibn Majah and Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) From the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Abbas <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> collected by Abu Dawood and this sanad is Hasan, its narrators are all narrators of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) From the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Abbas <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> collected by Malik and Muslim, and from him Abu Dawood, Nisae’ and Tirmidhi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[&#8216;Original Sifat as-Salah&#8217; vol. 3/p.998 – 1001]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Taken from Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">It is recommended to supplicate often during all times, especially during the month of Ramadan, in the last ten nights, and during the odd nights of it even more so. It is recommended that one say the following supplication a lot:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">This is due to what Imam Ahmad recorded from Aishah that she said &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If I find the Night of Al-Qadr what should I say?&#8221; He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi  wa sallam) replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Say : &#8220;O Allah! Verily You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.&#8221; [Ahmad 6:182]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#808080;">At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasai and Ibn Majah have all recorded this Hadith . At-Tirmdhi said &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan Sahih&#8221; . [Tahfat Al-Ahwadhi 9:495, An-Nasai in Al-Kurba 6:218, and Ibn Majah 2:1265]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#808080;">Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak (with a different chain of narration) and he said that it is authentic according to the criterial of the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muqbil</strong> ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said in ‘<em>al-Jaami &#8216;us-Saheeh mimmaa laisa fis-Saheehayn</em>’ (2/505-506): &#8220;<span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Three Whose Supplications Are Not Rejected</strong></span>&#8220;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Maajah</strong>&#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said (vol. 1, p. 557): `Alee ibn Muhammad narrated to us: Wakee` narrated to us from Sa`daan al-Juhanee: from Sa`d, Aboo Mujaahid at-Taa·ee &#8211; and he was reliable: from Aboo Mudillah &#8211; and he was reliable: from Aboo Hurairah, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>Sallalaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">There are three whose supplication is not rejected: the just ruler, the fasting person <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>until he breaks his fast</strong></span>, and the supplication of the oppressed person: Allaah will raise it up under the clouds on the Day of Resurrection, and the gates of heaven will be opened for it, and He says: ‘By My Might, I shall certainly aid you, even if it be after a time.’</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Imaam Ahmad</strong> <em>-rahimahullaah-</em> reported (vol. 2. pp. 304-305): Aboo Kaamil and Abun-Nadr narrated to us, both saying: Zuhayr narrated to us: Sa`daan at-Taa·ee narrated to us. Abun- Nadr said: Sa`d, Aboo Mujaahid: Abul-Mudillah, the freed slave of the Mother of the Believers, narrated to us that he heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! When we see you our hearts become tender, and we are from the people of the Hereafter; but when we depart from you this world attracts us, and we smell the women and the children.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If you were</span> &gt;&gt;, or he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If you were to be , in every state, upon the condition which you are upon when you are with me then the Angels would shake hands with you, and they would visit you in your houses; and if you did not commit sins, then Allaah would bring a people who committed sins so that He could forgive them</span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We said: O Messenger of Allaah! Tell us about Paradise: What is its structure?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">One brick of gold, and the next brick of silver, and its mortar is fragrant musk. Its pebbles are pearls and rubies. Its soil is saffron. Whoever enters it will enjoy bliss, and will never be unhappy. He will live forever, and he will not die. His clothes will not wear out, and his youth will not pass away. There are three whose supplication is not rejected: The just ruler, and <strong><span style="color:#993300;">the fasting person</span></strong> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>until he breaks his fast</strong></span>, and the supplication of the oppressed: it is carried upon the clouds, and the gates of heaven will be opened for it, and the Lord -the Mighty and Majestic- says: ‘By My Might! I shall certainly aid you, even if it be after a time.’</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>Saheeh</em> hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said in ‘as-Saheehah’ (2/657/no. 969):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a weak chain of narration, on account of this Abul- Mudillah. adh-Dhahabee said: ‘He is hardly known. No one narrates from him besides Aboo Mujaahid’, and there occurs in ‘at-Taqreeb’: ‘Maqbool (Acceptable when supported)’, and the rest of the narrators of the chain of narration of the hadeeth are reliable, narrators of al-Bukhaaree. I say: <span style="color:#993300;">However it is a ‘hasan’ or a ‘Saheeh’ hadeeth, on account of its previous witnesses and others&#8230;”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadeeth from Ibn Abbas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> made Qunoot for a month continuously in the Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha and morning prayer and at the end of every prayer after he said ‘<em>Sami Allaahu liman hamida’</em> in the last Rakat of that prayer, he would make Dua’ against the tribes of Bani Sulaym and those tribes of Dhakwaan and Usayatah who lived with Bani Sulaym, <strong>and those behind the Messenger would say Ameen.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Daawood in his ‘Sunnan’ no. 1443 in ‘the chapter of al-Qunoot in the Prayer’ and Shaykh Albani declared the hadeeth to be Hasan and he brings a research for the hadeeth in ‘Irwaa al-Ghaleel’ (2/163)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mundhir said in ‘al-Awsat’ (5/216) that <strong>Imam Malik</strong> used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam should make Qunoot from the middle of Ramadan and curse the Kuffar and those behind him should say Ameen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘al-Mudouwanah’ (1/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Imam makes Dua’ and those behind him say Ameen’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Mas’ail Ahmad li Abee Daawood p.67, Ishaaq also said this, as was mentioned by al-Marwaazi in ‘Qayam al-Layl’ 303]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Uthaymeen</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If we say that there is a Qunoot in the five daily prayers, then if the Qunoot is in a prayer that is read aloud, in this case it is known that the Qunoot is read out aloud, and if it is in a silent prayer then it is still read out aloud, as is established in the Sunnah: namely that the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to read the Qunoot and the people used to say Ameen behind him, and it would not have been possible to say Ameen except if he was reading it out aloud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This establishes the fact that the Sunnah is to read the Qunoot aloud even if it is in the silent prayers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Sharh al-Mumtaa’ (4/47)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is there any supplication reported from the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam and the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, at the time of breaking the fast? Should the fasting person repeat what the Mu’aththin says, or continue breaking his fast?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supplication at the time of fasting is most likely to be answered, because it is at the end of an act of worship, and in most cases, a human self is at its weakest point just before he breaks his fast. The weaker a person is physically, and the more tender-hearted, the greater is his feeling of repentance and humility towards Allaah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supplication which is reported from the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam is:</p>
<blockquote><p>اللهم لك صمت و على رزقك أفطرت</p>
<p><em>(Allaahumma Laka Sumtu Wa ‘Ala Rizqika Aftartu.)</em></p>
<p>“Oh, Allaah! For Your sake I have fasted and with Your sustenance I have broken my fast.”[1]</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he broke his fast, the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>ذهب الظمأُ، وابتلت الروق و ثبت الأجر إن شاء الله</p>
<p><em>(Thahabath-Thama’u Wabtallatil-‘Urooqu Wa Thabatal-Ajru In Sha’ Allaah.)</em></p>
<p>“Thirst has gone, the arteries are moist, and the reward is sure, if Allaah wills.”[2]</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although there may be some weakness in these two Ahadith, some of the Scholars have declared them to be Hasan; and in anycase, if you supplicated using these words or any others words that came to your heart when breaking your fast, then it is most likely to be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for answering the Mu’aththin when a person is breaking his fast, it is lawful, because of the saying of the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote><p>إذا سمعتم المؤذن فقولوا مثل ما يقول</p>
<p>“If you hear the Mu’aththin, then say what he says.” [3]</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">applys to all situations, except those which there is some evidence to show otherwise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Supplication for the Best of Both Worlds</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Taken From the articles &#8220;<strong>Reflections</strong>&#8221;<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, <strong>Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> relates that the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> would supplicate:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em> &#8220;</em>O Allaah! I ask You for guidance, piety, safety and well-being, and contentment and sufficiency<em>.&#8221;</em></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">[Allaahumma innee as&#8217;alukal-hudaa wat-tuqaa wal-&#8216;afaafa wal-ghinaa].</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sahih Muslim (no.2721)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>du&#8217;aa</em> (supplication) is <strong>from the most comprehensive and beneficial <em>du&#8217;aas</em> (supplications),</strong> since it includes asking Allaah for well-being with regards to both the Religion and the world. Thus, <em>al-hudaa</em> (the guidance) is beneficial knowledge, and <em>at-tuqaa </em>(i.e. <em>taqwaa</em> or piety) is righteous actions and leaving-off what Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden; and this is (asking) for correctness and well-being of a person&#8217;s Religion. For indeed, the Religion comprises of beneficial knowledge and recognising the truth &#8211; which is guidance &#8211; and standing firm upon obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; and this is piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-&#8216;afaafa</em> (well-being and safety) and <em>al-ghinaa</em> (contentment and sufficiency) comprises of being safe from (the harms of) the creation and that the heart is not attached to them. And it also comprises of being contented with Allaah and what He provides, and seeking whatever will cause the heart to be satisfied with Him. So with this, happiness in this worldly life is completed, and the heart tastes true sweetness and delight &#8211; and this is a goodly life. So whosoever is granted the provisions of guidance, Piety. well-being and contentment has indeed achieved true happiness, and has acquired all that could be possibly sought after, as well as being saved from all that is dreadful and frightening.&#8221; [<em>Bahjatul-Quloobul-Abraar </em>(p.198)]</p>
