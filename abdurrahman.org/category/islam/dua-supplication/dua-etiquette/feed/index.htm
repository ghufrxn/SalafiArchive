										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be in a state of humbleness/Calmness in Hope &amp; fear While making Du&#8217;a</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>[Aurah Al-Anbiyah 21:90, Muhsin Khan Translation]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Dar-us-salam Publication</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:left;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">﴿وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَباً وَرَهَباً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(and they used to call on Us with hope and fear,)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said, &#8220;<strong>Hoping for that (reward) which is with Us and fearing that (punishment) which is with Us</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:left;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">﴿وَكَانُواْ لَنَا خـشِعِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>and they were Khashi`in before Us</strong>.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means, <strong>sincerely believing in that which was revealed by Allah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said: <strong>&#8220;Truly believing.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Al-`Aliyah said: <strong>&#8220;Fearing.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sinan said: <strong>&#8220;Khushu` means the fear which should never leave our hearts.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also reported from Mujahid that the <strong>Khashi`in are those who are humble</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said, <strong>&#8220;The Khashi`in are those who humble themselves before Allah.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these suggestions are close in meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated that:He heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three men, amongst those who came before you, set out until night came and they reached a cave, so they entered it. A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: &#8216;Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon, one of them said: &#8216;O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock&#8217;. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape.</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">The next said: &#8216;O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.&#8217; The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out.</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: &#8216;O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.&#8217; The rock slipped aside and they got out walking freely&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on some people who sway from right to left and backwards and forwards while reciting the Qur&#8217;an? Please advise, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Swaying while reciting the Qur&#8217;an is one of the habits that should be abandoned. It contradicts the etiquettes required when reciting the Qur&#8217;an. When reciting or listening to the Qur&#8217;an, a person should listen carefully and not play with things so that the listener and the reciter ponder over the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an and their hearts be submissive to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Scholars mentioned that this is one of the habits of the Jews when reciting their Book, and we are forbidden to imitate them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having Sincerity for Allaah During Supplication</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great acts of worship the Muslims increase upon and show great concern for during the Hajj is Dua’, which is the most important form and best type of worship. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- described in the authentic hadeeth that Dua’ in itself is worship due to its great status and lofty nature. This is why there are many texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah showing the great importance and high status of Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts comprise praise for making Dua’, encouragement to make Dua’ and inspire different ways to make Dua’, sometimes with a command to make Dua’, sometimes explaining its position and status, sometimes praising the people who make Dua’ and sometimes mentioning the great and different types of reward for those who make Dua’ and warning against those who neglect to make Dua’ or refuse to do so out of haughtiness or arrogance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good doers.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Araaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me and do not believe in My Oneness,] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What increases the pilgrims in their concern for Dua’ and strengthens them in it during the Hajj is that they have combined the virtue and honour of the place they are in with the virtue and honour of the time period they are in, along with what descends upon their hearts of gentleness, humility and turning towards Allaah, especially on the Day of ‘Arafat which is the greatest and most noble of days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed it is known that on the evening of ‘Arafat Eemaan, mercy, light and blessings which cannot be expressed descend upon the hearts of the pilgrims.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- regarding the great matter of Dua’ on the Day of ‘Arafat and in explanation of its excellence, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> ‘The best of Dua’ is the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘… and from the Fiqh of the previous hadeeth is that the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat is better than all other Dua’. Also, in this hadeeth, is evidence that the Dua’s on the Day of ‘Arafat are all, generally, answered.’</strong></span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Hajj there are specific places at which it is necessary for the Muslim to stop. It is appropriate to make Dua’ at these places emulating the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, as it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would stop there, face the Qiblah and supplicate to Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There are six places in particular:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) In ‘Arafat &#8211; as previously mentioned.<br />
(2) In the places of al-Haraam where the Hajj rites take place, as Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then when you leave ‘Arafat, remember Allaah at Mash&#8217;ar-il-Haram</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah:198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3,4) On as-Safa and al-Marwa as is established in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Jaabir -RadhiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to stand on as-Safa he would say Allaahu Akbar three times and would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would do that three times and make Dua’ and would do likewise on al-Marwa.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5,6) After the stoning the two Jamaraat (the small one and medium one) as it is established in Saheeh Bukhari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Umar –Radhi Allaahu anhu- used to stone the small Jamaarah with seven small pebbles and used to recite Takbeer on throwing each stone. He then, would proceed further until he reached level ground, where he would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the medium Jamaarah similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the big Jamaarah from the middle of the valley but he would not stay by it. Ibn Umar used to say: ‘This is what I saw the Messenger of Allaah doing.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the six places where it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-stood, made Dua’ and raised his hands. Dua’ is a great matter and has a high status in Hajj. Generally, Dua’ has an innate nature in all aspects of worship, it is the spirit and essence of worship and it is established from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said: ‘Dua’ is worship.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If making Dua’ has distinguished status and a high rank then it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have a great concern for the significance of Dua’. He should understand that he is bound by its conditions and should be refined by its manners. He should be on-guard to avoid any actions that would prevent a Dua’ from being answered and he should be aware of the times when Dua’ is most likely to be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important matter in this great act that is necessary for the Muslim to check, is that his Dua’ is solely and sincerely for Allaah – Azza wa Jal. So he does not make Dua’ except to Allaah, he does not seek aid except from Allaah, nor does he request assistance, support and help or cure except from Allaah. This is because Dua’, as previously mentioned, is worship and directing any act of worship to other than Allaah is Major Shirk which takes a person outside of Islaam. We seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And invoke not besides Allaah any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will. And He is The Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful &gt;&gt; [Yunus : 106-107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilâh (god), for whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! the disbelievers will not be successful &gt;&gt; [al-Muminoon:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah &gt;&gt;[Jinn : 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, there are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of making Dua’ is what Allaah Ta&#8217;ala mentioned in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good – doers &gt;&gt;[al-‘Aaraaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Dua’, the Muslim combines bringing presence of the heart and the feeling of dire need of what is sought with the Dua’. He does this causing it to coincide with the best times for Dua’ along with Khushoo’ (humility) in the heart, subservience to his Lord, submission to Him, imploring Him, having graciousness, having faced the Qibla in a state of purification, raising his hands to Allaah, beginning with praise and exaltation of Allaah and joining this with prayer upon Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who is His slave and Messenger. After this, he puts forward, to Allaah, his requests of repentance and forgiveness, then beseeches Allaah, earnestly asking of Him with total subservience to Him, supplicating to Him with fervent desire and dread and seeking closeness to Him with His Names, Attributes and Tawheed. He makes this Dua’ with sincerity and so this Dua’ is not about to ever be rejected. This is especially so if all of this coincides with supplications the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- taught as well as the best times and places for the answering of supplications along with the greatest Name of Allaah, whereby if He is asked He bestows and if He is called with it, He answers the supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the supplications established in the books of Sunnah is: that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- heard a man saying: ‘O Allaah. I ask of You, whereby I testify that You are Allaah, there is no god except You, The One, The SelfSufficient, Who is not begotten nor does He beget and there is none that resembles Him.’ So the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed you have asked Allaah with His greatest name which if He is asked by, He bestows, and if He is supplicated to with it, He answers.’[8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the kind of permissible <strong>Tawassul</strong>: that a person asks someone to supplicate to Allaah, The Most High, for him, if it is hoped for that this person’s supplication will be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it should be that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">the person requesting someone to supplicate Allaah for him intends to benefit himself and his brother, the one from whom he asked the supplication, so that the request is not solely for his own interest</span></strong>. Since if you want to benefit your friend as well as yourself, then this will end up as something good for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because when a man supplicates to Allaah for his brother in his absence, the angel says: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Aameen, and for you the same</span></em>.” Similarly when someone supplicates Allaah for his brother, then he is from those who do good by virtue of this supplication, and Allaah loves those who do good.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Incorrect and Futile Tawassul and its Types</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 58:</strong> Having known the Correct <em>Tawassul</em> and its Types, then it is inevitable for us to know the Incorrect <strong>Tawassul</strong> and its Types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The incorrect and futile Tawassul is to use an unprescribed way, something which is not affirmed as a legal way by Sharee’ah, as a means of nearness to Allaah, The Most High. Since Tawassul in this manner is from nonsense and falsehood that contradicts the intellectual and textual proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is that a person uses the<span style="color:#000000;"> <strong>supplication of a deceased man as Tawassul to Allaah</strong></span> (عز و جل). He asks this deceased person to supplicate to Allaah for him. Then this is not a correct and prescribed means. Rather it is foolishness on the part of the one who asks this deceased man to supplicate to Allaah for him. Since once he dies, the actions of the deceased cease to exist, and it is impossible for him to supplicate to Allaah for anyone. Even the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not possible that he supplicates to Allaah for anyone after his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) death. For this reason, the companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) did not use as Tawassul to Allaah by asking the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to invoke Allaah for them after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, when the people suffered a drought at the time of ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (رضي الله عنه), he said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Allaah we used to ask Your Prophet to supplicate on our behalf to You and You would bless us with rain, and now we ask the uncle of our Prophet [i.e. al-‘Abbaas (رضي الله عنه)] to supplicate to You on our behalf, so bless us with rain</span></em>.” So al-‘Abbaas (رضي الله عنه) stood up and supplicated to Allaah (عز و جل). Had the matter of asking the deceased’s supplication to Allah been a permissible and correct way, then ‘Umar and those with him from the companions would have asked that from Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Since the response to his supplication is more likely to take place than that of ‘al-‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib (رضي الله عنه). What is important, therefore, is that Tawassul to Allaah by means of asking supplication from the deceased is false and impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the incorrect type of Tawassul is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to seek nearness to Allaah by means of the status of the Prophet</strong></span> (صلى الله عليه و سلم), saying: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Allaah, I ask you by the rank of Your Prophet [to grant me] such and such.</span></em>” This is since the status of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is not something of benefit to you. It is only beneficial to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but as regard to you then it is of no benefit to you that you use as Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High. And as we have mentioned, Tawassul is seeking the correct means that is fruitful. So, what is of benefit to you in that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has an honourable status with Allaah? And if you want to make correct Tawassul to Allaah, then say: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah, I ask You by my Eemaan in Your Prophet, or by my love of Your Prophet”</span></em> or the like, then this is from the correct and beneficial means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Taken from the  ‘Original <em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>‘ By Shaykh Muhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</strong><br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to raise his hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">_________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Summary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani mentions the Narration of Anas bin Malik when the Qur’aanic recitors were killed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas said: I never ever saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>painfully agitated about anything as I saw him agitated over them. Indeed I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in the early morning prayer raising his hands and he supplicated against those who killed them.  [And in another narration: supplicating against them.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (3/137)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Isnaad</em> is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tabraani narrated in ‘Sagheer’ also from Anas with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> whenever he would pray the early morning prayer, he would raise his hands supplicating against them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This portion was narrated by al-Bayhaqi (2/211) and Nawawi (3/500) said: ‘Its <em>Isnaad</em>is <em>Saheeh</em> or <em>hasan</em>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a recommendation in this hadeeth of raising the hands while supplicating the<em>Qunoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Farj the freed slave of Abu Yusuf said: ‘I saw my master Abu Yusuf, if he would enter into the <em>Qunoot</em> for the <em>Witr</em> he would raise his hands in the <em>Dua</em>.’ From ‘Sharh al-Hidayah’ (1/306)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Ahmad holds this opinion and so does Ishaaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The raising of the hands is established from the Ameer-ul-Mumineen Umar bin al-Khattab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> as is narrated by Bukhari in ‘Rafa’ al-Yadain’ (23), Ibn Nasr (134) and al-Bayhaqi (2/212) on the authority of Abu Uthmaan an-Nahdi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar would perform the <em>Qunoot</em> with us in the early morning prayer, and would raise his hands, so much that the side of his body under his arms would be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for wiping the hands on the face after ending the <em>Dua’</em> in the prayer, then this is not established with an authentic narration, nor an authentic statement, nor by analogy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>Bida’</em>, as for outside the prayer, then it is not authentic, and everything that is narrated regarding this is weak, some of it is more severe in its weakness than other narrations; I have researched it in ‘Da’eef Abi Dawood’ (262) and ‘al-Hadeeth as-Saheehah’ (597), this is why al-Izz bin Abdus-Salaam said in some of his <em>Fatawa</em>: ‘None does this except an ignorant person.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is foremost that it should not be done, and restricting to what the Salaf <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> did, of raising the hands in the <em>Dua’</em> without wiping the face in the prayer. And success lies with Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘the Original Sifat as-Salah’ vol 3 p.957-959]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Raising of the hands in the <em>Qunoot</em> for a problem afflicting the Muslims is established from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he made <em>Dua’</em>against the <em>Mushrikeen</em>, those who killed seventy of the recitors of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was narrated by Imam Ahmad (3/137) and by Tabraani in ‘as-Sagheer’ (p.111) from the hadeeth of Anas with an authentic chain, and it is also established from Umar and others in the <em>Qunoot</em> of <em>al-Witr</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Irwaa al-Ghaleel’ (2/181)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>41- The Ruling of Raising the Hands in the <em>Dua’</em> of </strong><em><strong>al-Witr</strong><br />
</em>By Shaykh, <em>Allaama Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling of raising the hands in <em>al-Witr</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Raising the hands in the <em>Qunoot</em> of <em>al-Witr</em> is legislated; because the <em>Qunoot</em> is from the same type as the <em>Qunoot</em> when new hardships occur for the Muslims, and this is indeed established by the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, that he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> raised his hands when he made <em>Dua’</em> in the <em>Qunoot</em> when new hardships occur for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was collected by al-Bayhaqi <em>–Raheem’ullaah-</em> with a authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqalaat Mutafariqa’ vol.30 p.51 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Some <em>Athaar</em> of the Companions regarding raising the hands in <em>al-Qunoot<br />
</em></strong>Collected by Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) From Abu Uthmaan who said: ‘Umar used to read the <em>Qunoot</em> with us after <em>Rukoo’</em>and he would raise his hands so much so that the side of his body would be seen, and his voice could be heard from the back of the <em>Masjid</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah (3/316), Bayhaqi (2/212) &amp; Ibn al-Mundhir (5/213)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) From Ibn Abbas that he prayed the <em>Qunoot</em> with the people at <em>Fajr</em> in Basrah, and he raised his hands so much so that the side of his body was raised up.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Saheeh – Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah (2/316)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c) From Ibn Mas’ood that he used to raise his hands in the <em>Witr</em> then after that he would lower them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hasan – Collected by Abdur Razzaq (4/325)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah.<br />
</em></span><span style="color:#808080;"><em>By Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani.<br />
</em></span><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2654 – From Abu Hurairah from the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Whoever does not supplicate (make <em>Dua’</em>) to Allaah, then Allaah is angry with him.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari in ‘Adab al-Mufrad’, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim, Ahmad, Ibn Abi Shaybah, al-Bayhaqi in ‘ash-Shawba’ and by Tabaraani. Albani declared it <em>Hasan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani brought a supporting hadeeth from an-Nu’maan <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>, the wording of which was: ‘<strong><em>Dua’</em> is worship</strong>’ then the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>And your Lord said:<span style="color:#008000;"> ‘Call on Me, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and ask Me for anything) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will respond to your </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(invocation)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Verily! Those who scorn My worship </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness,]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span></strong></span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by the collectors of the <em>Sunnan</em> and by other than them. Ibn Hibban, al-Hakim and Dhahabi authenticated it, as well as others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is researched in ‘Ahkaam al-Janaiz’, ‘Saheeh Abi Dawood’ and in ‘Rowda al-Nadeer’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani comments:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And there is no doubt that staying away from Allaah’s <em>-Ta’ala-</em> worship due to arrogance and not making <em>Dua’</em> to Him necessitates Allaah’s anger upon the one who does not make <em>Dua’</em> to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth [of Nu’maan] is a strong support for the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah due its meaning and not from its chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the <strong>ignorant Soofis</strong> have neglected these Ahadeeth or have pretended to neglect them.  They claim that making <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah is inappropriate behaviour with Allaah, they have become affected with an <em>Israeeli</em> narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#ff0000;">‘His knowledge of my condition spares me from asking from Him.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So they were ignorant that when the slave of Allaah makes <em>Dua’</em> to His Lord <em>–Ta’ala-</em> it is not the case that the slave of Allaah is informing Allaah <em>–Subhanahu wa Ta’ala –</em> his need of Him &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">He knows what is kept secret and that which is yet more hidden.</span> &gt;&gt; rather it is the act of actualization of the <em>Uboodeeyah</em> of Allaah (servitude of worship) and the slave of Allaah’s need of Him and his own impoverishment.</strong></p>

Chapter 332<br />
Abomination of saying: &#8220;Forgive me if you wish, O Allah!&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1743.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You must not supplicate: `O Allah! forgive me if You wish; O Allah bestow mercy on me if You wish.&#8217; But beg from Allah with certitude for no one has the power to compel Allah.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration of Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A supplication should be made in full confidence and one should persistently express his desire (before Allah) in his supplication, for no bounty is too great for Allah to bestow (upon his slaves).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1744.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you supplicates, let him be decisive and he should not say: `O Allah, bestow upon me such and such if You wish&#8217;, because no one has the power to compel Him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

Chapter 252<br />
Some Verdicts Pertaining to Supplications</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1496.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who is favoured by another and says to his benefactor: `Jazak-Allah khairan (may Allah reward you well)&#8217; indeed praised (the benefactor) satisfactorily.</span>&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1497.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Do not invoke curses on yourself or on your children or on your possessions lest you should happen to d<span style="color:#0000ff;">o it at a moment when the supplications are accepted, and your prayer might be granted</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1498.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A slave becomes nearest to his Rubb when he is in prostration. So increase supplications in prostrations</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1499.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The supplication of every one of you will be granted if he does not get impatient and say (for example): `I supplicated my Rubb but my prayer has not been granted</span>&#8216;.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The supplication of a slave continues to be granted as long as he does not supplicate for a sinful thing or for something that would cut off the ties of kinship and he does not grow impatient</span>.&#8221; It was said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What does growing impatient mean?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is one&#8217;s saying: `I supplicated again and again but I do not think that my prayer will be answered.&#8217; Then he becomes frustrated (in such circumstances) and gives up supplication altogether.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1500.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;At what time does the supplication find the greatest response?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A supplication made during the middle of the last part of the night and after the conclusion of the obligatory prayers</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1501.</b> `Ubadah bin As-Samit (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whenever a Muslim supplicates Allah, He accepts his supplication or averts any similar kind of trouble from him until he prays for something sinful or something that may break the ties of kinship</span>.&#8221; Upon this someone of the Companions said: &#8220;Then we shall supplicate plenty.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah is more plentiful (in responding)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1502.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to say when he was in distress: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">La ilaha illallahul-Azimul-Halim. La ilaha illallahu Rabbul-`Arshil-`Azim. La ilaha illallahu Rabbus-samawati, wa Rabbul-ardi, wa Rabbul-`Arshil-Karim. (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the Incomparably Great, the Compassionate. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the Rubb of the Mighty Throne. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the Rubb of the heavens, the Rubb of the earth, and the Rubb of the Honourable Throne)</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 243<br />
The Obligation of Supplicating Allah to Exalt His Mention and its Excellence,<br />
and its Manner</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah exalts the mention of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and His angels supplicate Him to do so.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1397.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever supplicates Allah to exalt my mention, Allah will exalt his mention ten times.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1398.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will be nearest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1399.</b> Aus bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Among the best of your days is Friday; so supplicate Allah more often for me in it , for your supplications will be displayed to me</span>.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How will our blessings be displayed to you when your decayed body will have mixed with the earth?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1400.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1401.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not make my grave a place of festivity, and supplicate Allah for me, for your supplication reaches me wherever you are</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1402.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whenever someone greets  me, Allah returns the soul to my body (in the grave) and I return his greeting</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1403.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned but he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1404.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard some one supplicating after his prayer without praising Allah and without supplicating Allah for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). With regard to him, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This man rushed.</span>&#8221; Then he called him and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any one of you have performed Salat (prayer) and wants to supplicate, let him praise Allah first then glorify Him in the beginning and then he should supplicate Allah for me. Then he may supplicate for whatever he likes</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1405.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>Muhammad  Ka`b  bin `Ujrah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to us and we asked him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, we already know how to greet you (i.e., say As-salamu `alaikum), but how should we supplicate for you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `Allahumma salli `ala Muhammadin, wa `ala `ali Muhammadin, kama sallaita `ala `ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidum Majid. Allahumma barik `ala Muhammadin, wa `ala `ali Muhammadin, kama barakta `ala `ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidum Majid [O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you exalted the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1406.</b> Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were sitting in the company of Sa`d bin `Ubadah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to us. Bashir bin Sa`d said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Allah has commanded us to supplicate for you, but how should we do that?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept silent. We were much perturbed over his silence and we wished he did not asked him this question. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you exalted the family of Ibrahim. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are the Praised, the Glorified,&#8217; and the method of greeting (i.e., Salam) is as you know</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 250<br />
Issues regarding Supplications, their Virtues and Supplications of the Prophet<br />
(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And your Rubb said: `Invoke Me, [i.e., believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism)] (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation)</b></span><span style="color:#000080;"><b>.</b></span><b>&#8221;&#8217; (40:60)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Invoke your Rubb with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors.</b></span><b>&#8221; (7:55)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor).</b></span><b>&#8221; (2:186)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil</b></span><b>?&#8221; (27:62)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1465.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Du`a (supplication) is worship</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1466.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) liked comprehensive supplications or (Al-Jawami` &#8211; i.e., supplications with very few words but comprehensive in meanings), and discarded others</span>.<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1467.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The supplication most often recited by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma atina fid-dunya hasanatan, wa fil-akhirati hasanatan, wa qina `adhab-annar (O our Rubb! give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the punishment of the Fire)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Muslim it is added that whenever Anas supplicated, he used to beseech Allah with this Du`a.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1468.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma inni as&#8217;alukal-huda, wat-tuqa, wal-`afafa, wal-ghina (O Allah! I beseech You for guidance, piety, chastity and contentment)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1469.</b> Tariq bin Ashyam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever a man entered the fold of Islam, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would show him how to perform Salat and then direct him to supplicate: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumm-aghfir li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> warhamni, wa-hdini</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa `afini</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> warzuqni</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah! Forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, guard me against harm and provide me with sustenance and salvation)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration Tariq said: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What shall I say if I want to pray to my Rubb?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `Allahumma-ghfir li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> warhamni</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa `afini</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> warzuqni</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah! Forgive me, have mercy on me, protect me and provide me with sustenance).&#8217; Surely, this supplication is better for you in this life and in the Hereafter</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1470.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicated: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma musarrifal-qulubi, sarrif qulubana `ala ta`atika (O Allah! Controller of the hearts, direct our hearts to Your obedience)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1471.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Seek refuge in Allah against the turmoils, attacks of misfortunes, and evil of judgement and joys of the enemies</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1472.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to say: &#8220;<span style="color:#800000;">Allahumm-aslih li diniyalladhi huwa `ismatu amri</span><span style="color:#800000;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#800000;"> wa aslih li dunyaya-llati fiha ma`ashi</span><span style="color:#800000;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#800000;"> wa aslih li akhirati-llati fiha ma`adi</span><span style="color:#800000;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#800000;"> waj`alil-hayata ziyadatan li fi kulli khair, waj`alil-mauta rahatan li min kulli sharrin (O Allah, make my religion easy for me by virtue of which my affairs are protected, set right for me my world where my life exists, make good for me my Hereafter which is my resort to which I have to return, and make my life prone to perform all types of good, and make death a comfort for me from every evil)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1473.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me, &#8220;Recite: `<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma-hdini wa saddidni</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah! Direct me to the Right Path and make me adhere to the Straight Path).&#8221; Another narration is: `Allahumma inni as&#8217;aluk-alhuda was-sadad (I beg You for guidance and uprightness)</span>.&#8221;<br />

I seek refuge in You from helplessness (to do good), indolence, cowardice, senility, and miserliness; and I seek Your Protection against the torment of the grave and the trials of life and death]</span>.&#8221; Another narration adds: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">wa dala`id-daini wa ghalabatir-rijal (And from the burden of indebtedness and the tyranny of men)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1475.</b> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I requested the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to teach me a supplication which I could recite in my Salat (prayer). Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite: `Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman kathiran, wa la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta, faghfir li maghfiratan min `indika, warhamni</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> innaka Antal-Ghafur-ur-Rahim (O Allah! I have considerably wronged myself. There is none to forgive the sins but You. So grant me pardon and have mercy on me. You are the Most Forgiving, the Most Compassionate)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

The Excellence of Supplicating in one&#8217;s Absence</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1494.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whenever a Muslim supplicates for his (Muslim) brother in his absence, the angels say: `May the same be for you too</span>&#8216;.&#8221;<br />

Remembrance of Allah in the Morning and in the Evening</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاذْكُر رَّبَّكَ فِي نَفْسِكَ تَضَرُّعًا وَخِيفَةً وَدُونَ الْجَهْرِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ وَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ الْغَافِلِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>And remember your <em>Rubb</em> by your tongue and within yourself, humbly and with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings, and in the afternoons and be not of those who are neglectful.</b></span><b><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221;</span> (7:205)</b></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>And declare the perfectness of your <em>Rubb</em> before the rising of the sun, and before its setting</b></span><b><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (20:130)</b></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ بِالْعَشِيِّ وَالْإِبْكَارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>And declare the perfectness of your <em>Rubb</em> and praise Him in the `<em>Ashi</em> (i.e., the time period after the midnoon till sunset) and in the <em>Ibkar</em></b>(i.e., the time period from early morning or sunrise till before midnoon)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (40:55)</b></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِي بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">رِجَالٌ لَّا تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَارَةٌ وَلَا بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَاةِ وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ ۙ يَخَافُونَ يَوْمًا تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ الْقُلُوبُ وَالْأَبْصَارُ</span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>Verily, We made the mountains to declare the Perfectness of Allah with him </b>[Dawud (David)]<b> in the `Ashi </b>(i.e., after the midday till sunset)<b> and Ishraq </b>(i.e., after the sunrise till midday)<b>.</b></span><b><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221;</span> (38:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1451.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who recites in the morning and in the evening the statement: `<em>Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi</em> (Allah is free from imperfection and I begin with praising Him)&#8217; one hundred times, will not be surpassed on the Day of Resurrection by anyone with better deeds than one who utters the same words or utters more of these words</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1452.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and said, &#8220;What a trouble I suffered from a scorpion which stung me last night!&#8221; He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Had you said in the evening: `A`udhu bikalimatillahit-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek the protection of Allah&#8217;s Perfect Words from the evil of whatever He has created),&#8217; it would not have harmed you</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1453.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to say in the morning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma bika asbahna, wa bika amsaina, wa bika nahya, wa bika namutu, wa ilaikan-nushur </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(O Allah! With Your Power we have come to the morning, with Your Power we come to the evening, with Your Power we live, and we die, and to You will we return</span>).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the evening he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma bika amsaina, wa bika nahya, wa bika namutu, wa ilaikan-nushur </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(O Allah! With Your Power, we have come to the evening, by You do we live, by You do we die, and to You is the return)</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1454.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Teach me some words so that I may recite them in the morning and in the evening.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite these words: `Allahumma fatiras-samawati wal-ardi, `alimal-ghaibi wash-shahadati, Rabba kulli shai&#8217;in wa malikahu. Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Anta, a`udhu bika min sharri nafsi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa sharrish-Shaitani wa shirkihi </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of the hidden and the exposed! Rubb of everything and every one. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your Protection from the evil of my own self from the evil of Satan and from the evil of Shirk to which he calls)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) added: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite these words in the morning and the evening and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">when you go to bed</span></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1455.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When it was evening, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to supplicate:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Amsaina wa amsal-mulku lillah, wal-hamdu lillah. La `ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(We have entered upon evening and the whole kingdom of Allah, too, has entered upon evening. Praise is due to Allah. There is none who has the right to be worshiped but Allah, the One who has no partner with Him)</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (the narrator) said: I think that he (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to follow the recitation with these words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shi&#8217;in Qadir. Rabbi as&#8217;aluka khaira ma fi hadhihil-lailati, wa khaira ma ba`daha; wa a`udhu bika min sharri ma fi hadhihil-lailati, wa sharri ma ba`daha; Rabbi a`udhu bika minal-kasali, wa su</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">il-kibari; Rabbi a`udhu bika min `adhabin fin-nari, wa `adhabin fil-qabri </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(His is the sovereignty and to Him is all praise due, and He is Omnipotent. My Rubb, I beg of you good that lies in this night and good that follows it, and I seek refuge in You from the evil that lies in this night and from the evil of that which follows it. My Rubb! I seek refuge in You from lethargy and the misery of old age. O Allah! I seek Your Protection from the torment of Hell-fire and the punishment of the grave)</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it was morning, he (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) would recite the same, replacing the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">We have entered upon evening and the whole kingdom of Allah, too, has entered upon evening&#8221; with &#8220;We have entered upon morning and the whole kingdom of Allah entered upon morning</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Replace the words &#8220;Amsaina, amsa, hadhihil-lailati, ma ba`daha with Asbahna, asbaha, hadhal-yaumi, ma ba`dahu, respectively.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1456.</b> `Abdullah bin Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite Surat Al-Ikhlas and Al-Mu`awwidhatain (Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas) three times at dawn and dusk. It will suffice you in all respects</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1457.</b> `Uthman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who recites three times every morning and evening:</span></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللهِ الَّذِي لَا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h2>

<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Remembrance  of Allah, Supplication, Repentance and Seeking Forgiveness (Kitab Al-Dhikr) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous  outpourings of man&#8217;s heart before his Lord, but it is an expression of his sense of  nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His mercy, grace and  blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he supplicates about,  and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his  soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before  its Creator. The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality  of the faith that is imprinted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his  thought and activity. Thus to understand the spirit of any religion and appraise its value  to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The Prophet (may peace be upon him)  was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made supplications to his Lord with  zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. One who  cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great  Master, his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine  Mercy and unflinching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before  Him. These are in fact the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a  Muslim has been instructed to make whether singly or in congregation, whether at the  appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden call or urge to His Lord, reflects the  one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. Whatever is the state of  spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly in his  mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the  supplications in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal  name of God, i. e. Allah, is used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called  out in order to make the worshipper conscious of his own weak and dependent self before  his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help and grant him what he desires, and at  the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself through the realisation of what  God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own inner life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality  a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, it covers the whole range of human life with all  its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds expression in a deep and urgent  longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive situation, forgiveness  of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Hereafter.  This consciousness of one&#8217;s absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man&#8217;s attitude of perfect  resignation before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the  spirit of despondence and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that  the Being Who is the Lord of man&#8217;s fate can also help him and save him even in the most  trying circumstances. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him)  eminently combine in themselves the mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim  supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undisturbed with concentrated gaze one Supreme  Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of all values. But, unlike mystics,  he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself but realises  himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and  unwavering confidence in God. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications  taught by Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit  of social fellowship. They do not urge man to stand face to face with God in absolute  loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein the suppliant begs his Lord with  the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling that the distress which  vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the salvation  for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity.  There is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in  these supplications, but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which  the soul is supposed to be unified with God losing all its individual identity. Here the  soul has a communion with Allah with full consciousness of man&#8217;s own self, his social  surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the supplications have been  expressed in the form&#8221; We&#8221; and Us&#8221;. </font></p>

And if he    remembers Me in his heart, I also remember him in My Heart, and if he remembers Me in    assembly I remember him in assembly, better than his (remembrance), and if he draws near    Me by the span of a palm, I draw near him by the cubit, and if he draws near Me by the    cubit I draw near him by the space (covered by) two hands. And if he walks towards Me, I    rush towards him.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Shaddad bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;The most superior way of asking for  forgiveness from Allah is: &#8216;Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa anta, Anta Khalaqtani wa  ana abduka, wa ana &#8216;ala ahdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu, A&#8217;udhu bika min Sharri ma sana&#8217;tu,  abu&#8217;u Laka bini&#8217;matika &#8216;alaiya, wa Abu Laka bidhanbi faghfirli innahu la yaghfiru  adhdhunuba illa anta.&#8221; The Prophet added. &#8220;If somebody recites it during the day  with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the  people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies  before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying.&#8221; By Allah! I ask for  forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Harith bin Suwaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud related to us two narrations: One from  the Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were  sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall on him; whereas the wicked person  considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like  this.&#8221; Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration.  (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the repentance  of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has  his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a  short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and  suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from). He then  says, &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he  raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the  repentance of His slave than anyone of you is pleased with finding his camel which he had  lost in the desert. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to pray eleven Rakat in the late part of  the night, and when dawn appeared, he would offer two Rakat and then lie on his right side  till the Muadhdhin came to inform him (that the morning prayer was due). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;When you want to go to  bed, perform ablution as you do for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say:  &#8216;Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu Amri ilaika wa aljatu zahri ilaika, raghbatan  wa rahbatan ilaika, lamalja&#8217;a wa la manja mink a ill a ilaika. Amantu bikitabi kalladhi  anzalta wa bi nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta&#8217;. If you should die then (after reciting this) you  will die on the religion of Islam (i.e., as a Muslim); so let these words be the last you  say (before going to bed)&#8221; While I was memorizing it, I said, &#8220;Wa  birasiulikal-ladhi arsalta (in Your Apostle whom You have sent).&#8217; The Prophet said,  &#8220;No, but say: Wa binabiyyi-kalladhi arsalta (in Your Prophet whom You have  sent).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 328: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet woke  up, answered the call of nature, washed his face and hands, and then slept. He got up  (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the mouth thereof and performed ablution not  using much water, yet he washed all the parts properly and then offered the prayer. I got  up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that I was watching  him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, stood on  his left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered  thirteen Rak&#8217;at in all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath  as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the Prophet of the  approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer  without performing new ablution. He used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij&#8217;al fi  qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam&#8217;i nuran, wa&#8217;an yamini nuran, wa&#8217;an yasari nuran,  wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj&#8217;al li nuran.&#8221;  Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, &#8220;I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet  mentioned in this invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-&#8216;Abbas and he narrated  those seven things to me, mentioning, &#8216;(Let there be light in) my nerves, my flesh, my  blood, my hair and my body,&#8217; and he also mentioned two other things.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet got up at night to offer the night prayer,  he used to say: &#8220;Allahumma laka-l-hamdu; Anta nuras-samawati wal ardi wa man fihinna.  Wa laka-l-hamdu; Anta qaiyim as-samawati wal ardi wa man fihinna.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima complained about the blisters on her hand because of  using a mill-stone. She went to ask the Prophet for servant, but she did not find him (at  home) and had to inform &#8216;Aisha of her need. When he came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about it.  Ali added: The Prophet came to us when we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get  up, he said, &#8220;&#8216;Stay in your places,&#8221; and sat between us, till I felt the  coolness of the feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you of a  thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to your beds, say &#8216;Allahu  Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdu &#8216;illah&#8217;  thirty-three times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221; Ibn Sirin said,  &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; (is to be said for) thirty-four times.&#8221; </font></p>

Will you please recite to us some of your poetic verses?&#8221;  So &#8216;Amir got down and started chanting among them, saying, &#8220;By Allah! Had it not been  for Allah, we would not have been guided.&#8221; &#8216;Amir also said other poetic verses which  I do not remember.

Would that you  let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; When the people (Muslims) lined up, the battle  started, and &#8216;Amir was struck with his own sword (by chance) by himself and died. In the  evening, the people made a large number of fires (for cooking meals). Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;What is this fire? What are you making the fire for?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;For cooking the meat of donkeys.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Throw away what is in the pots  and break the pots!&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! May we throw away what is  in them and wash them?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Never mind, you may do so.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 509, Vol. 5). </font></p>

(The sub-narrator, Sufyan, quoting Jarir, perhaps said, &#8220;I  went out with a group of men from my nation.&#8221;) and came to Dhi-al-Khalasa and burnt  it, and then came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not come to you  till I left it like a camel with a skin disease.&#8221; The Prophet then invoked good upon  Ahmas and their cavalry (fighters). </font></p>

If you come  to some people who are engaged in a talk, don&#8217;t start interrupting their talk by  preaching, lest you should cause them to be bored. You should rather keep quiet, and if  they ask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say.  And avoid the use of rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his  companions always avoided it.&#8221; </font></p>

I seek refuge with you (Allah) from  (worries) care and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice,  from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other men.&#8221; I kept on  serving him till he returned from (the battle of) Khaibar. He then brought Safiya, the  daughter of Huyay whom he had got (from the booty). I saw him making a kind of cushion  with a cloak or a garment for her. He then let her ride behind him. When we reached a  place called As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared (a special meal called) Hais, and asked me to invite  the men who (came and) ate, and that was the marriage banquet given on the consummation of  his marriage to her. Then he proceeded till the mountain of Uhud appeared, whereupon he  said, &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it.&#8221; When he approached Medina, he  said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the land between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains a  sanctuary, as the prophet Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (the people  of Medina) in their Mudd and the Sa&#8217; (units of measuring).&#8221; </font></p>

Be kind to yourselves, for you are not calling upon a deaf or an  absent one, but You are calling an All-Hearer, and an All-Seer.&#8221; Then he came to me  as I was reciting silently, &#8220;La haul a wala quwwata illa bil-lah.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Say: La haul a walaquwata illa bil-lah, for it is one of the  treasures of Paradise.&#8221; Or he said, &#8220;Shall I tell you a word which is one of the  treasures of Paradise?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he  used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his  Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has  advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me and one of them sat at my  head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is wrong with  this man?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Who  has worked magic on him?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;With what did he work the magic?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair, which  are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;It is in Dharwan.&#8217; Dharwan was a well in the  dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to that well and  returned to &#8216;Aisha, saying, &#8216;By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion  of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha added,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for me, Allah has cured  me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn  and harm others with).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father: &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was bewitched, so he invoked Allah repeatedly requesting Him to cure him from that  magic).&#8221; Hisham then narrated the above narration. (See Hadith No. 658, Vol. 7) </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Noble Scholar, Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-’<strong>Uthaymeen</strong> [1]<br />
<em>Majmoo’ul-Fataawaa war-Rasaa‘il</em> (no. 155)<br />
<strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [Q]:</strong> ‘Allaah says: ‘‘<strong>And your Lord says: Call upon Me and I will, respond to your supplication.</strong>’’ [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60] So why is it that a person’s <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) is sometimes unanswered?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A]:</strong> ‘‘All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May the Prayers and Peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family and his Companions.  I ask Allaah for the ability to be correct in belief, speech and actions, for myself and for my brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And your Lord says: Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication. Verily those who are too arrogant to worship Me will, enter Hell in humiliation.</strong>’’ [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner stated that he did indeed make <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; but it was not answered by Allaah. So he is in doubt with respect to this noble <em>aayah</em> (verse), in which Allaah promises to answer the one who supplicates to Him, and indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; never breaks His promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the clarification of this is that there are certain conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for a supplication to be answered.  These conditions are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Firstly:</strong> Sincerity to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic. That is to say, one must be sincere in his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication), so he turns to Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections with an attentive heart, being truthful in his turning to Him, knowing that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; is capable of answering his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) and hoping that the <em>du’aa</em> will be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Secondly:</strong> During <em>du’aa</em>, the caller should feel that he is in need of Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High – in fact in dire need; and that only Allaah alone answers the supplication of the one in distress and the One who removes evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Thirdly:</strong> That the one making <em>du’aa</em> should refrain from <em>haraam</em> (unlawful) matters, as this acts as a barrier between the person and his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) being answered &#8211; as has been established in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em>, from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) who said: ‘‘Indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High -is good and accepts only that which is good. Allaah has ordered the Believers to do that which He commanded the Messengers. Allaah &#8211; the Most High -has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>O you Messengers! Eat of the good things and do righteous actions.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Mu‘minoon 3:51 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘‘O you who Believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you.</strong> ’’ [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned (the case of) a man who, having journeyed far is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his bands to the sky (saying): ‘O Lord! O Lord,’ whilst his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful and he is nourished unlawfully. So how can he be answered!’ [2] So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) explained the un-likelihood that this person’s <em>du’aa </em>would be answered, even after fulfilling the apparent factors which aid the <em>du’aa </em>being answered. The apparent factors being:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i]: Raising ones’ hands towards the sky, meaning towards Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; since Allaah is above the heavens, above His <em>’Arsh</em> (Throne). Extending the hands out towards Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is amongst the causes of <em>du’aa</em> being responded to, as is shown in the narration from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: ‘‘Indeed your Lord is Alive, Most generous. He feels shy that when his servant raises his bands towards Him, calling upon Him, that He should return him empty, having nothing.’’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii]: This man called upon Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; using the name <em>Rabb</em> (Lord).  Seeking <em>tawassul </em>(the means of nearness to Allaah) with this name is also regarded as one of the causes for <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to, since the <em>Rabb</em> is the Creator, the Owner, the Governor of all affairs &#8211; and the reigns of the Heavens and the earth are in His Hands.  Due to this, you will find that most of the supplications made in the Noble <em>Qur‘aan</em> are by this name:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Our Lord! We have heard the call of one calling us to faith: ‘Believe you in the Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and take to Yourself our souls in the company of the righteous. Our Lord! Grant us what You did promise unto us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of judgement, for You never break Your promise. And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, whether male or female.</strong>’’ [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:193-195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>tawassul</em> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) by this name is one of the causes for the <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii]: This man was a traveller, and journeying is often a cause for <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to, because a person feels more in need of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; when travelling, than when a person is resident with his family. He was dusty and dishevelled, seeming very insignificant in himself, as if the most important thing to him was to implore Allaah and to call upon Him &#8211; in any condition he may be &#8211; whether dusty and dishevelled, or in ease and oppulance. Being dusty and dishevelled is also instrumental, like in the <em>hadeeth</em> attributed to the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) in which he said: Indeed Allaah boasts to the people of the Heaven about the people standing at ’Arafah, saying: ‘‘Look at My servants who have come to Me dusty and dishevelled.’’ [4] However, these factors did not bring about anything, because his food, his nourishment and his clothing were all <em>haraam </em>(unlawful). So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) remarked: ‘‘So how can he be answered!’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if these conditions are not satisfied, then the question concerning the <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) being answered will seem distant. However, if the conditions are satisfied and the one supplicating is still not answered, then this is due to a wisdom which Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; knows, and the one supplicating does not know what this wisdom is; and maybe that you like a thing and it is bad for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these conditions are fulfilled and the one supplicating is not answered, then either he has been protected from an evil which is greater than what he has asked for, or Allaah stores it for him until the Day of Resurrection, and he then gets a greater reward. This is so, because the one who makes <em>du’aa</em> &#8211; calling upon Allaah alone, fulfilling the conditions and not being answered, but rather being saved from a greater evil &#8211; is in the position of having carried out the causes yet has been prevented from being answered, and therefore has a two-fold reward. One reward for making <em>du’aa </em>(supplication), and another reward for bearing the trial of not being answered. So that which is greater and more complete is stored for him with Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also of importance is that the one supplicating should not express dissatisfaction if his <em>du’aa </em>is apparently not being answered, for this action in itself is a reason for the <em>du’aa</em> not being answered &#8211; as the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘‘A servants <em>du’aa</em> continues to be answered as long as be does not ask for anything sinful or breaking the ties of relations, and as long as be does not become impatient.’’ It was said: How does one become impatient O Messenger of Allaah? He said: ‘‘He says: I have supplicated, I have supplicated, yet it has not been answered.’’ [5] He therefore becomes dispondant and abandons supplicating. So it is not befitting that the one supplicating should become impatient about being answered, then become disappointed and dispondant, and thereby abandon making <em>du’aa</em>. Rather, one should call upon Allaah, since every <em>du’aa</em> you make to Allaah is an act of worship, which brings you closer to Him and increases your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my brother, you should take to making <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) in all affairs, be it general or specific, in difficulty or in ease. And if it was that supplication was only a means of worshipping Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; then that would be sufficient. So it is more befitting that a person strives in this &#8211; and with Allaah lies the success and the ability.’’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Imaam ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Abdul ’Azeez Ibn Baaz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the du’aa’s of the Day of ‘Arafaah despite the fact that they include aayaat from the Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth reciting du’aa’s that are prescribed for the rituals of Hajj. Also, according to the correct opinion, there is nothing wrong with them reading Qur’aan as well, because there is no clear <i>saheeh</i> report that states that the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth should not read Qur’aan. It was reported that the man who is <i>junub</i> (in a state of impurity following sexual activity), in particular, should not read Qur’aan whilst he is <i>junub</i>, because of the hadeeth of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). With regard to the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth there is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: &#8220;The menstruating woman and the man who is junub should not read Qur’aan&#8221; – but it is da’eef (weak), because the hadeeth was reported by Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Ayyaash from the Hijaaziyeen, and he is da’eef in his reports from them. But she should read without touching the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’aan in Arabic), from memory. In the case of the man who is junub, he should not recite Qur’an at all, either from memory or from the Mus-haf, until he has done ghusl. The difference between them is that the timespan for the one who is junub is very short, he can do ghusl straightaway, as soon as he finished having intercourse with his wife. He is not junub for long, and it is up to him when he wants to do ghusl; if he cannot find water, he can do tayammum (&#8220;dry ablution&#8221; using dust etc.) and pray and read Qur’aan. But the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth has no control over her situation – it rests with Allaah, may He be glorified. The period lasts for a number of days and nifaas (post-natal bleeding) is the same. So it is permissible for them to recite Qur’aan so that they do not forget it and so that they do not miss out on the blessings of reciting Qur’aan and learning the rules of sharee’ah from the Book of Allaah. If that is the case, then it should certainly be permissible for them to read books containing du’aas that are a mixture of aayaat and ahaadeeth, etc… this is the more correct of the two opinions of the scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I read some Tafseers (Qur’anic commentaries) when I am not taahir (ritually pure), such as during my monthly period. Is there any sin on me for doing that? Will I be committing a sin if I do that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no sin on the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth if she reads books of Tafseer or even if she reads Qur’aan without touching the Mus-haf, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. As for the man who is junub, he should not read Qur’aan at all until he has done ghusl, but he can read books of Tafseer and hadeeth etc., without reading whatever they contain of aayaat, because of the report that nothing would stop the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from reading Qur’aan except janaabah (being junub). According to a hadeeth narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a jayyid isnaad, he said: &#8220;As for the man who is junub, he should not read even one aayah.&#8221; [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa from Permanent Commitee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: alifta.net</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 2: does Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah) negate du`a&#8217; (supplication)? That is to say, &#8220;Can a Muslim slave put his trust in Allah without performing Du`a&#8217; citing this Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) which says &#8220;Whoever is occupied with My Dhikr rather than seeking My Grace, I shall give him/her the best I give to the seekers.” What is meant by &#8220;My Dhikr&#8221;? Does it mean the Holy Qur&#8217;an? And what is meant by &#8220;seeking My Grace&#8221;? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Whoever does not ask Allah,surely Allah will be angry with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is what is meant by this Hadith. My question is, &#8220;Can we combine Du`a&#8217; with Tawakkul? Actually, I have been confused between the Hadith Qudsy and the Prophetic Hadith mentioned above. What is deemed preferable, asking Allah or being busy with Dhikr rather than asking Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First of all, This Hadith is related by Al-Tirmidhy in His Jami`, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan ibn Abu Yazid Al-Hamadany from `Amr ibn Qays from `Atiyyah from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry who reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) as saying, Allah (Glory be to Him) says, &#8220;Whoever is occupied with the Qur&#8217;an rather than remembering Me and seeking My Grace, I shall give him/her the best I give to the seekers. Indeed, the superiority of Allah&#8217;s Word over that of man is to equal to His superiority over His creation. This Hadith is Da`if (a Hadith that fails to reach the status of Hasan, due to a weakness in the chain of narration or one of the narrators) as the chain of its narrators includes `Atiyyah Al-`Awfy and Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan ibn Abu Yazid, who are considered as weak narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Hatim Al-Razy said, &#8220;This is a Hadith Munkar (rejected Hadith reported by a weak narrator whose narration conflicts with an authentic Hadith).&#8221; Al-Hafizh Al-Dhahaby said, &#8220;Al-Tirmidhy tried to raise it to the rank of Hasan, but it is not considered as Hadith Hasan.&#8221; The Hadith was also related by Al-Darimy in his Sunan and Al-Tabarany in his book &#8220;The Du`a&#8217; (supplication)&#8221; and Al-Bayhaqy in Al-Asma&#8217; wa Al-Sifat (Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes). It was also mentioned by Ibn Al-Jawzy in &#8220;Al Mawdu`at&#8221; (fabricated Hadith); Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, Many texts in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah have recommended Du`a&#8217; urging its performance to the extent of describing it as the core of worship. Allah (may He be Exalted) said, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 186 And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright. Allah (may He be Praised) also said,Surah Ghafir, 40: 60 And your Lord said: “Invoke Me, [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islâmic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221; In addition, there are many other relevant Qur&#8217;anic verses. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Du`a&#8217; (Supplication) is itself the worship. Related by As-hab-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) through an authentic Sanad (chain of narration). Du`a&#8217; is not in conflict with Tawakkul, as the former denotes application of the means. Whoever thinks that Tawakkul means deserting Du`a&#8217; is fabricating lies against Shari`ah, the same as the one who thinks that Tawakkul can be a substitute for the application of the means, like selling, purchasing, cultivating in addition to other means. What is lawful for every Muslim is combining Tawwakul with pursuing the rightful and permissible means. In Allah Alone we seek help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">The Messenger of Allah related that Allah Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“…if he calls upon Me, I answer him, and if he asks of Me, I will give him…”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Rajab</strong> commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…This means that this person who is beloved and close to Allah has a special status with Allah such that if he asks Allah for something, He gives it to him, and if he seeks refuge with Allah from anything, He protects him from that thing, and if he calls upon Him, He answers him. So, he ends up becoming from those whose supplications are answered due to his honor with Allah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many from the righteous early generations were known to have their supplications answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the <em>‘Sahih’</em> that ar-Rubay’ bint an-Nadr broke a tooth of a slave. So, they offered compensation, and they refused. They asked for pardon, and they refused. The Messenger of Allah was then going to implement the rule of retaliation between them. Anas bin an-Nadr said: “The tooth of ar-Rubay’ will be broken? By the One who has sent you with the truth, her tooth will not be broken.” So, the people were pleased and took the compensation. The Messenger of Allah then said: <strong>“Indeed, from the slaves of Allah are those who, if they make an oath upon Allah, He fulfills it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…And Ibn Abi ad-Dunya reported with his chain that an-Nu’man bin Qawfal said on the day of Uhud: “O Allah, I swear that I will be killed and enter Paradise.” So, he was killed, and the Prophet said: <strong>“Indeed, Nu’man made an oath upon Allah, and He fulfilled that oath.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Nu’aym reported with his chain from Sa’d that ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh said on the day of Uhud: “O Lord, if I meet the enemy tomorrow, give me an adversary who is strong and harsh for me to fight for Your Sake and for him to fight me. Then, let him cut off my nose and ear so that when I meet You the next day, You Say: <strong><em>‘O ‘Abdullah! Why were your nose and ear cut off?’ </em></strong>I will say: ‘For You and Your Messenger.’ And You will Say: <strong><em>‘You have spoken the truth.’</em></strong>“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa’d said: “I saw him at the end of the day with his nose and ear hanging from a thread.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Sa’d bin Abi Waqqas would have his supplications answered. A man lied upon him, and he said: “O Allah, if he is lying, take away his eyesight, elongate his life, and expose him to trials and tribulations.” So, the man was stricken with all of this, as he used to walk through the streets and come into contact with the slave girls, saying: “I am an old man who is experiencing <em>fitnah</em>. I have been stricken with the supplication of Sa’d!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he supplicated against a man he heard insulting ‘Ali, and immediately, a camel came and trampled him to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a woman disputed with Sa’id bin Zayd over some land he owned, claiming that he had taken from her land. So, he said: “O Allah, if she is lying, take away her eyesight and kill her in her own land.” So, she became blind, and one night when she was walking in her land, she fell into a well and died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-’Ala’ bin al-Hadrami was on an expedition, and those with him became very thirsty. So, he prayed and supplicated: “O Knower, O Bestower, O Most High, O Mighty! We are Your slaves, and we are fighting Your enemy for Your Sake. Give us water to drink and make ablution from, and do not allow anyone else to benefit from this water!” They walked for a bit to find a river of water flowing from the sky. They drank from it and filled their vessels. Later, some of his companions returned to where the river was to find that there was nothing there, as if there had never been any water there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And someone complained to Anas bin Malik of a drought in a part of al-Basrah. So, he performed ablution and went out to the patch of land, prayed two units, and it then began raining on the patch of land, and the rain did not fall anywhere beyond that patch of land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…And Abu Muslim al-Khawlani was known for having his supplications answered. Once, a gazelle passed by him, and the young boys in the area said: “Ask Allah to allow us to capture this gazelle!” So, he supplicated, and he captured it and held it until they were able to take it from his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he once supplicated against a woman who had ruined his relationship with his wife that her eyesight be taken away. She immediately went blind, and she came to him begging. So, he had pity for her and asked Allah to return her eyesight to her, and his wife returned to her normal state with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man lied upon Mutarraf bin ‘Abdullah, and Mutarraf said: “If you are lying, I ask Allah to hasten your departure,” and the man died on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a Kharijite used to pass by the classes of al-Hasan al-Basri and annoy those present. When it became unbearable, al-Hasan said: “O Allah, You Know how he has harmed us. So, suffice us against him with what You Will,” and the man immediately collapsed and was carried dead to his family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Silah bin Ashim was on an expedition, and his camel wandered off with all of his belongings, and there was nobody else around. So, he stood and prayed, saying: “O Allah, I swear that you will return my camel and belongings,” and it walked back until it stood right in front of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…And Habib al-’Ajami Abu Muhammad was known for having his supplications answered. He once supplicated for a young boy who was bald, and would weep and wipe his tears over the boy’s head. The boy’s hair began growing black all over his head, and it looked better than it had before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…And Sa’id bin Jubayr was patient upon the harm inflicted upon him by al-Hajjaj until he killed him, and he was from those whose supplication was answered. He used to have a rooster whose crowing would wake him up to pray at night. One night, it didn’t wake him up on time, and he became very distressed, saying: “What is wrong with it? May Allah cut off its voice!” It never crowed again, and his mother said: “My son, do not supplicate against anything ever again.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">See <em>‘Jami’ al-’Ulum wal-Hikam’</em> (2/348-354) for more.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://followthesalaf.com/from-the-fiqh-of-al-adiyyah-wal-adhkaar-calli" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://followthesalaf.com</a><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture was given on Saturday, May 5, 2012 at Masjid at-Tawheed in Stone Mountain, GA.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This talk is based on the book Fiqh al-Ad&#8217;iyyah wal-Adhkaar by our noble <strong>Sheikh Abdur-Razzaaq ibn Abdil-Muhsin al-Badr,</strong> and may Allah preserve them both.  This book was actually a set of classes given by the Sheikh on a Quran Radio Station in Saudi Arabia.  However, many of the students and scholars alike saw the tremendous benefit in these classes and requested him to compile them into a book.  He did this and then sent it to the noble <strong>Sheikh ibn Baaz</strong>, rahimahullah, who read it and praised it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can also find this book as an ebook on the website of the Sheikh here :<br />
<a href="http://www.al-badr.net/web/download/ebook/muallafat3.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-badr.net/web/download/ebook/muallafat3.html</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And perhaps this will be an incentive for some to study the arabic language, in shaa Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the highlights of the talk is the mention of ibn Abbaas,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The shaytaan is sitting on the heart of the Son of Adam in wait.  Once that heart becomes heedless, he begins to whisper.  And when the person begins to remember Allah, he flees and is humiliated.</span></p>

<span style="color:#808080;">al-Shaykh ‘Abd al- ‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Vol. 11, pp. 188-190 &#8211; <a style="color:#808080;" href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1804&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></span></p>
<p>From ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin ‘Abdullah Ibn Baz to those who receive this among Muslims. May Allah guide all Muslims and increase their knowledge and faith, amen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!) It gives me pleasure to remind my Muslim brothers that &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is of the Sunnah for a Muslim to say after each obligatory Salah, whether one is the Imam (the one who leads the congregational Salah), Ma&#8217;mum (a person being led by an Imam in Prayer) or Mufarid (a person who performs prayer alone) to say, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>three times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>أَسْـتَغْفِرُ الله </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><br />
&#8220;Astagfir Allah&#8221; </strong></span>[#1]<br />
(I ask Allah forgiveness)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> and then say,</p>
<p><strong>اللّهُـمَّ أَنْـتَ السَّلامُ ، وَمِـنْكَ السَّلام ، تَبارَكْتَ يا ذا الجَـلالِ وَالإِكْـرام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahumma Anta Al-Salam Wa Minka Al-Salam, Tabarakta Wa Ta’alayta Ya-dhal-Jalali Wal-Ikram&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">[#1]</span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(O Allah, You are Al-Salam [the One Who is free from all defects and deficiencies] and from You is all peace, blessed are You, Possessor of majesty and honor!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one is Imam, one should turn facing the people. The Imam, those praying behind him, or a person offering Salah individually should say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا نَعْبُدُ إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ، لَه النِّعْمَةُ وَلَهُ الْفَضْلُ وَلَهُ الثَّنَاءُ الْحَسَنُ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> اللَّهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay &#8216;in Qadeer. Laa hawla wa laa quwwata &#8216;illaa billaahi, laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu, wa laa na&#8217;budu &#8216;illaa &#8216;iyyaahu, lahun-ni&#8217;matu wa lahul-fadhlu wa lahuth-thanaa&#8217;ul-hasanu, laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu mukhliseena lahud-deena wa law karihal-kaafiroon. Allaahumma laa mani&#8217;a limaa &#8216;a&#8217;tayta, wa laa mu&#8217;tiya limaa mana&#8217;ta, wa laa yanfa&#8217;u thal-jaddi minkal-jadd.</strong></span> [#2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, alone, without any partner. To Allah belong all sovereignty and praise. He is Omnipotent over all things. There is no might nor power except with Allah. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. We worship none but Him. To Allah all favor, grace, and praise are due. None has the right to be worshipped except Allah and we are sincere in faith and devotion to Him although disbelievers detest it. Oh Allah! Oh Allah! None can prevent what You willed to give and none can grant what You have willed to prevent, and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone, as from You is all wealth and majesty).</p>
<p>After offering Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer and Fajr (Dawn) Prayer one should say along with what is mentioned previously,</p>
<p>After completing the prayer:</p>
<p><strong>لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحَدْهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in Qadeer</strong></span></p>
<p>[None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, Who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise . He brings life and He causes death , and He is Able to do all things.]</p>
<p>After that, one is to say each of the following supplications <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>thirty three times</strong></span>;</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Subhana Allah&#8221; </strong></span>(Glory is to Allah),</p>
<p><strong>(b) &#8220;</strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; </strong></span>(praise is due to Allah) and</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; </strong></span>(Allah is the Great),</p>
<p>and then <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>complete the hundred</strong></span> by saying,</p>
<p><strong>لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحَدْهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in Qadeer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended for the Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite these supplications <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>audibly</strong> </span>after each obligatory Salah in a low voice without disturbing others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported in the two Sahih on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>that raising one&#8217;s voice in supplication after concluding the obligatory Salah was during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;I used to know when they finished the Salah by this (supplications as they were said aloud) if I heard them.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on Adhan, no. 841; Muslim, Sahih, Book on Masjids and places for Salah, no. 583; Al-Nasaa&#8217;y, Sunan, Book on Sujud-ul-Sahw, no. 1335; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 1003; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 1, p. 367.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not permissible to say these supplications collectively</span>. Each worshipper should recite them individually without observing the voice of others, because reciting supplications collectively is Bid’ah and has no basis in the divine Shari’ah (law) of Allah.</p>
<p>It is recommended for Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span> (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Foot stool, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255<strong>)  </strong>[#3]  <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>inaudibly</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Iklas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 112),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Falaq </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 113), and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Nas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 114)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">inaudibly</span> </strong>after each obligatory Salah and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>repeat them three times</strong> after the Maghrib (Sunset) and Fajr (Dawn) Salahs</span>. [#4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is preferable, for the authenticity of what we have mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, His companions, and those who follow him rightfully till the Day of Judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">‘I say my morning and evening supplications regularly and we seek refuge in Allaah yet we still experience afflictions.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say if you recite the morning and evening supplications then <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>it is necessary to move the tongue</strong></span> while reciting them, there is no benefit if you pass your eyes along the lines of the page and to say that this is a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>silent reading. This is not considered reading</strong></span> or speech in the Arabic tongue. Reading in the Arabic language necessitates movement of the tongue, as is known from the hadeeth which is narrated from the Companions -may Allaah be pleased with them- that they knew when the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was reciting silently due to the movement of his beard. This illustrates that the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- whilst reciting silently would move his lips and tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This moving of the tongue is if the person has the capability to move his tongue and that there is nothing to hinder the movement of the tongue.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Two Categories of Du&#8217;a</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Du’aa‘: And ad-du’aa‘ is divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] the du’aa‘ of worship and<br />
[ii] the du’aa‘ of asking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And both of them fall into the essence of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]: So the du’aa‘ of worship</strong> is to direct every act of worship, whether it is related to one’s wealth or body or both of them together, to Allaah the Blessed and Exalted. This is to be done in a manner that is in agreement with the purified Sharee’ah of Allaah and His upright commands. And at the beginning of this type of worship is the Tawheed of Allaah the Blessed and Exalted as is proven by the truthful statement, “And I have not created the Jinn, nor the mankind, except to worship Me.” [Sooratudh-Dhaariyaat 51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, so that they single Me out with knowledge that the Tawheed of a servant cannot be completed, except by freeing oneself from Shirk which is the opposite of Tawheed. This is because when we have to know Tawheed with its Sharee’ah meaning, we say, ‘It is to single out Allaah with worship and to exonerate Him from Shirk, to be free from it and its people, whether it is committed in a small amount or in abundance and whether it is major or minor.’ So Tawheed cannot be completed, except after attaining complete freedom from Shirk and its people and all of its forms and manifestations. Due to this, the Scholars have stated, “There is no walaa‘ (allegiance), except with baraa‘ (enmity).”104</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2]: ad-du’aa‘ul-mas‘alah (supplication of request): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And du’aa‘ul-mas‘alah is to request something from Allaah the Blessed and Exalted in order to bring about a worldly or religious benefit and to remove a harm the like thereof. So the request in this way is a form of worship. It is not permissible to direct this towards anyone other than Allaah the Blessed and Exalted. Indeed, the Scholars have divided du’aa‘ul-mas‘alah into various categories. From them is that which it is not permissible to seek except from Allaah the Blessed and Exalted alone. So whoever directs anything from it to other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then he has committed major Shirk with Allaah. And that is like the one who calls upon other than Allaah with regards to that which no one is capable of granting besides Allaah the Blessed and Exalted, from bringing about benefit or removing harm. As for seeking something from the creation that they are capable of granting, then there is no prohibition with regards to that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Source: <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=8652&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alifta.net</a></p>
<p><strong> Q 1: How should we supplicate to</strong><strong> Allah (may He be Exalted)? </strong>Is it permissible for a person to supplicate to Allah in Salah (Prayer) in any language? Will their Salah be valid?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>The Muslim should supplicate to Allah (may He be Exalted) with humility and in secret without asking for unlawful things. A person may supplicate to Allah both during Salah and at other occasions, in whatever language they speak. Salah is considered valid even if the person supplicates to Allah (may He be Exalted) in a language other than Arabic. When supplicating to Allah (may He be Exalted) during Salah, a person should use the Du`a&#8217; (supplication) that are authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) and recite them where and how the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited them so as to follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Many scholars wrote books on the Du`a&#8217; and Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), such as (Al-Kalim Al-Tayyib) by Ibn Tayymiah, (Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib) by Ibn Al-Qayyim, and (Riyad Al-Salihin) and (Al-Adhkar) by Al-Nawawy. You can buy any of these books to know the authentically reported Du`a&#8217; and Adhkar, and how and when they should be said. This is better and of great benefit to you.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah b. ‘Âmir Al-Juhanî – Allâh be pleased with him – once passed by a man who looked like a Muslim, so he greeted him with salâm, and he replied, “And upon you [be peace] and the mercy of Allâh and His blessings.” A boy informed him, “He is a Christian!” So ‘Uqbah got up and followed the man, caught up with him and said, <span style="color:#008000;">“<em>The mercy of Allâh and His blessings are upon the believers; however, may Allâh give you a long life, and make plentiful your wealth and offspring</em>.”</span> [Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Adab Al-Mufrad]</em></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albânî</strong> grades its chain of narration hasan in <strong><em>Sahîh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad</em></strong> p444, and notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In this narration this illustrious Companion indicates that it is permissible to supplicate for someone to have a long life, even if he is an unbeliever, and so [this can be done for] a Muslim <em>a fortiori</em>…However, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the supplicant should make sure that the unbeliever is not an enemy of the Muslims</span>. It is also taken from this [narration] that such an unbeliever can be commiserated with what has been mentioned therein [i.e. the believers are the ones who will receive the mercy of Allâh and His blessings].”</p>
