										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those Who Commit Suicide in the Name of “Jihad” are Actually Followers of Satan<br />
املنتحرون باسم اجلهاد أتباع للشيطان :Original Title<br />
Author: Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān, a member of Saudi Arabia’s council of senior scholars and the Permanent Committee of scholars, describes those who claim they are performing “Jihad” for the sake of Allah by committing suicide are actually fighting for the sake of Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who fall into this type of corruption never sought the council of any Islamic scholars, never learned anything from them. Instead, they isolate themselves from mainstream Muslims and privately accompany people who act as the worst “human idols.” Such people then began brain washing individuals until they eventually harbor enmity towards the public and thus carry out these types of attacks. They consider Muslims to be disbelievers, they murder them, blow up buildings indiscriminately killing both the young and old, male and female, Muslims and those non-Muslims guaranteed safety and living peacefully under Muslim laws (in Muslim nations) – all because of this corrupt ideology.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end result of all those who turn to wicked people for guidance and to the very callers and propagators that the messenger ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) told of when he was asked about certain trials and tribulations that will occur toward the end of time; he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ مَنْ أَطَاعَهُم قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Callers at the doors to Hell; whoever obeys them, they will cast him into it (Hell).</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the state of affairs now and it only confirms this statement of the messenger (.مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ). When such people align themselves with callers to misguidance, those callers lead others into it (misguidance or Hell). Everyone condemns them and hates their actions – both non-Muslims and believers. And no one supports their actions except those like them and those on the same methodology. This issue (of suicide attacks) is certainly a great tribulation and evil, and it is crucial that Muslims carefully understand the issue and not rush to act. Anyone (confused about the issue) should ask the people of religious knowledge to clarify the correct position and then ask Allah for guidance. People should not simply trust others with regards to this issue without knowing the reality of such propagators and whether they are established upon truth or not even though they may outwardly show good conduct, religious fervor, and honor for Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for everyone who outwardly shows good and truth yet is religiously ignorant, we must not hasten to him and give him our trust and reliance until we know the reality of him, his character, and his behavior. This only happens due to giving such a person the benefit of the doubt yet without really looking into his affairs or asking the people of knowledge, intellect, and good advice. As a result, these groups are formed because of people simply hastening to act and because of religious ignorance and mixing with evil people, trusting in them, relying on them and staying away from the mainstream Muslims and their scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Such people (suicide bombers) are always those who avoid religious lessons and the scholars so they naturally fall into these types of things. Similarly, they usually isolate themselves from their families and homes.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent especially on the Muslim youth to take a lesson from such people, for the successful people are those who learn lessons from the actions of others. We must learn from these incidents that we have to stick to our religious limits and stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and not split off from them and turn to others (for guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] This article was published in the Arabic newspaper, “Okaz,” on Thursday, April 23, 2009, issue no. 2867. For the full Arabic text, see: <a href="http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The full text of the ḥadīth is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ḥudhayfah Ibn al-Yamān said: People used to ask Allah’s messenger about good things, but I used to ask him about bad circumstances fearing that I may fall into them. So I said, “Oh messenger of Allah, we used to live in evil during the times before Islam then Allah brought us this good (Islam), so will there be more evil times after these good times?” He ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) replied, “Yes.” I further asked, “And will there then come good after that evil?” He answered, “Yes, but it will be tainted.” I asked, “Why will it be tainted?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» قَوْمٌ يَهْدُوْنَ بِغَيْرِ هَديي، تَعْرِفُ مِنْهُم وَتُنْكِرُ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be people who will guide with other than my guidance. You will recognize some things from them and reject other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, “And will there be after that good even more evil?” He replied:<br />
» نَعَم، دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ، مَنْ أَجَابَهُم إِلَيْهَا قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, there will be callers at the doors of Hell; whoever answers their call, they will cast him into it (Hell).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then said, “Oh messenger of Allah, describe them for us.” He said:<br />
» هُمْ مِنْ جِلْدَتِنَا وَيَتَكَلَّمُوْنَ بَأَلْسِنَتِنَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be from our skin (Arab) and speak our tongue (language). I asked, “So what do you instruct me to do if I reach those times?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» تَلْزِمُ جَمَاعَةَ املُسْلِمِيْنَ وَإِمَامَهُم «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stick with the mainstream group of Muslims and their leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What if there is no main group and no leader?” The prophet ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» فَاعَتَزِلْ تِلْكَ الفِرَقَ كُلَّهَا وَلَوْ أَنْ تَعُضًّ بِأْصِلِ شَجَرَةٍ حَتَّى يُدْرِكُكَ املَوْتُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى ذَلِكَ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the root of a tree and remain in that state until death comes to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh AbdusSallaam bin Salim bin Raja’ as-Suhaymee</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdusSallaam as-Suhaymee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the issue of speaking about Suicide missions, is that whether the person who is fought against, is he actually from the combatants, and that <em>Jihad</em> in reality is facing the <em>Kuffar</em> in  a battle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suicide Missions have become a modern day fashion, and many people are sympathetic with the one who carries it out by looking at the goal behind these missions.  The sympathetic person finds it sufficient from these missions that the intent of executing these missions is to raise the statement of <em>Tawheed</em>, and to aid Islaam and humble the<em>Kuffar</em> as they claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is the <em>Sharia’</em> ruling regarding these Suicide Missions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Ends Do not Justify the Means]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is known from the <em>Sharia’</em> that a good intention on its own is not sufficient to allow an action to be permissible according to the <em>Sharia’</em>.  These people, who carry out Suicide Missions, propel themselves by saying that the means to the end take the same rulings of the intended goals, so if the goal is legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> then its means are also legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em>.  However this is not acceptable, because the ends do not justify the means absolutely, rather it is obligatory that the means also have to be legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> to fulfill the goals in the <em>Sharia’</em>.  As for, if the means are not legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> then it is not sufficient for the goal to be legislated.  The principle for this is mentioned in Bukhari and Muslim from the saying of the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ( من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action which is not in accordance with the command of Allaah or His Messenger then it is rejected (Allaah does not accept it) from the one who does it, no matter how good his intention was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now that this point has been established, then indeed the well regarded scholars of today hold the view that these acts of suicide are not permissible, and from these scholars are: the respected Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Baz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>, and the noble Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen, the respected Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Abdullaah Alaa-Shaykh, the noble Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan, and Shaykh AbdulAzeez ar-Rajihi, and Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Ubaykan and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sharia’</em> proofs from the Book and the Sunnah and the intellect, show that these operations are <em>Haram</em> according to the <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Book of Allaah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  إِنْ يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ الْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِثْلُهُ وَتِلْكَ الْأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ النَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنْكُمْ شُهَدَاءَ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الظَّالِمِينَ   &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allaah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allaah likes not the <em>Zâlimûn </em>(polytheists and wrong­doers).&gt;&gt;[Ala-Imraan: 140]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being: that this <em>Ayaah</em> contains the evidence for a principle, which is, that seeking martyrdom in the path of Allaah is a selection made by Allaah and the choice of Allaah Subhanahu, and it is not for everyone who wants to be a martyr. The view that it is permissible to carry out suicide missions to kill the enemy nullifies this principle. The proof for this point in this <em>Ayaah</em> is the saying of Allaah Subhanahu: &lt;&lt; آمَنُوا وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنْكُمْ شُهَدَاءَ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;and that He may take martyrs from among you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the One who chooses who is martyred in His Way. As for the one who commits suicide to kill the enemy then he is not a martyr, because he himself has appointed the time in  which to die, and this in the <em>Sharia’</em> is defined as suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, Allaah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties; for the price that theirs shall be Paradise. They fight in Allaah’s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. &gt;&gt; [Tawbah:111]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَوْ يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;and whoso fights in the Cause of Allaah, and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being from these two <em>Ayaat</em>: that the one who kills himself with explosives or in other ways wanting to kill the enemy then it is not correct to label him as a martyr;<strong>because the martyr is the one who is killed by the enemy. </strong>In the first <em>Ayaah</em>those that have been promised Paradise are two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The combatant and the one killed by the enemy. And in the second <em>Ayaah</em>: the one promised with great reward is the one who is killed by the enemy or the one who is victorious, however whoever kills himself with explosives does not enter under the meaning of these two <em>Ayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا () وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ عُدْوَانًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:29-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being: This <em>Ayaah</em> generally includes a person committing suicide, and these type of suicide operations include killing the innocent, from women, old people and children, and there is no doubt that this is from transgression and oppression, and the one who carries out a suicide mission is deserving of this severe warning and it applies to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Sunnah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From Abu Huraira &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu- </em>who said: That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قتل نفسه بحديدة فحديدته في يده يتوجأ بها في بطنه في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا و من شرب سما فقتل نفسه فهو يتحساه في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا و من تردى من جبل فقتل نفسه فهو يتردى في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever jumps off a mountain and kills himself, he will be jumping off into the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From Thaabit bin Dhihak that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قتل نفسه بشيء عذب به يوم القيامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever kills himself with something  then he will be punished with that thing on the day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- From Abu Huraira &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu- </em>who said: That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الذي يخنق نفسه يخنقها في النار و الذي يطعنها يطعنها في النار</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever strangles himself then he will strangle himself in the Hell-Fire, and whoever stabs himself then he will stab himself in the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being from these <em>Ahadeeth</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That these <em>Ahadeeth</em> generally show that it is prohibited for a person to kill himself no matter what the reasons are, and this includes everyone that kills himself with whichever means used.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Intellect:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That these operations indeed bring a backlash with a greater evil consequence upon Islaam and the Muslims, whether that is in Palestine or in any other place.  These operations in reality show contempt and scorn of the blood of the Muslims, and sacrifices for these operations are with no benefit worth mentioning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- That these operations actually <strong>fulfill the aims of the enemies of Islaam</strong> in an indirect way, by giving the enemies of Islaam the excuse by which they have fulfilled their aims in the easiest way, along with the clear weakness of the Muslims in defending themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- That these suicide missions which are aimed at other than those who are combatants from women, children and old people are a deterrent against the  <em>Deen</em> of Allaah, because of the oppression of these suicide missions and their harshness, cheating, treachery, lying and all of these are contradictory to the <em>Sharia’</em> of Islaam, all of them are contradictory and the explanation of that is from the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First point: that the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is the <em>Deen</em> of justice even in dealing with the enemy, so their oppression against the Muslims does not in turn justify oppressing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَنْ صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَنْ تَعْتَدُوا وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from <em>Al-­Masjid­ al-­Haraam </em>(in Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help one another in <em>Al-­Birr </em>and <em>At-­Taqwa </em>(virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment.&gt;&gt; [Maidah:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Well­Acquainted with what you do.&gt;&gt; [Maidah:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the Hadeeth <em>Qudsi</em> that Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O My worshippers, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.’ [Collected by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that aiming for innocent people and killing them due to the crime of someone else is from the severest of <em>Dhulm</em> (oppression).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second point: that the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is the <em>Deen</em> of mercy and doing goodness, and this is not just to human beings alone, but even to animals, and these suicide missions are in contradiction to mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third point: That the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is a <em>Deen</em> of courage and sacrifice, and it is not courage to hide behind treachery and deception. Indeed Allaah ordered us at the inception of fighting a people, between whom we have a contract with or at the time we fear from them an action, Allaah ordered us to give them an announcement of war before launching war against them.  Allaah – Subhanahu – said: &lt;&lt; وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِنْ قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَانْبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَى سَوَاءٍ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْخَائِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;If you fear treachery from any people throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms (that there will be no more covenant between you and them). Certainly Allaah likes not the treacherous.&gt;&gt; [Anfal:58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah obligated upon us that even in war with them that we do not kill except those who fight us from amongst their men. And these people who carryout suicide missions commit a great crime against Islaam and the Muslims, so they ascribed Islaam to oppression, treachery and cheating. Islaam is not aided with oppression nor with cheating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What becomes clear from what has preceded, from the clear, authentic evidence that suicide operations are not allowed, which some have entitled: ‘martyr missions’ and that those who hold it to be permissible do not have any clear authentic proof what so ever, and what they use as proof for its permissibility is either a proof which is not authentic or it does not indicate to what they claim, and no one rejects this point except an ignorant person or someone who follows his desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken From: ‘Jihad fee Islaam’ by Shaykh AbdusSallaam as-Suhaymee p.112 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">From Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a person commits suicide due to the circumstances of life and what he experiences of hardships of living and spending upon his family, would this mean that, that person will stay in Hell-fire?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All praise be to Allaah, <em>Sallat</em> and <em>Sallam</em> be upon the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suicide is a great evil, and it is a sin from the major sins.  It is not permissible for a Muslim to commit Suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. &gt;&gt; 4:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said in an authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever commits suicide using something then he will be punished using that thing on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon a believer is that he forces himself to have patience and resilience if a catastrophe befalls him and he endures difficulties in his <em>Dunyaa</em>matters.  He should not be hasty in committing suicide, rather he should be warned against that, and fear Allaah, and he should be patient and utilize the means to keep away from committing suicide, and whoever fears Allaah then Allaah will make a way out for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person commits suicide then he risks the Anger of Allaah and His punishment, and that person is under the Will of Allaah, this is because committing suicide is less than<em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Subhanahu –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. &gt;&gt; 4:48</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <strong>whatever is less than <em>Shirk</em> then it is under the Will of Allaah</strong>, and committing suicide is less then <em>Shirk</em>, likewise is <em>Zina</em> (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.  All of these things are sins that are less than <em>Shirk</em>, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.  If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after he is purified and cleared he will be taken out of the Fire, and according to the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em> <strong>he will not stay in the Hell-Fire</strong> for eternity. A sinner will not stay in the Fire for eternity, nor will a murderer, nor any other sinner, however if Allaah wants He will give him His punishment.  Allaah punishes whomsoever He wills in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of that person’s sins, then Allaah takes him out of the Fire to a river, which is called, the river of life, and he is planted there just like a seed is planted and grows on the sides of the banks of a torrential river. When that person’s growth has been completed, then Allaah enters him into Paradise due to his Islaam and his <em>Eemaan</em> upon which he dies. Only the disbeliever will stay in the Fire for eternity, only the disbelieving <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists) those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messenger, or those that belie Allaah’s Messengers, or that reject what Allaah’s Messengers brought, or other things similar to these of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the sinner, then according to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em> he will not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, and this is in contrast to the position of the Khawarij and the Mu’atazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed groups from the Khawarij and Mu’atazilah – and they are two misguided groups – say that a sinner will stay in the Hell-Fire forever, if he enters it!  And this is a grave mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em>, and they are the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible.  However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reoccurring Ahadeeth from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about this point, namely that some people will enter the Fire due to their sins then Allaah will take them out of the Fire due to the intercession of the intercessors, or with Allaah’s mercy without anyone’s intercession, and all of this is established from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br />
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Major sin – Twenty-Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The One Who Commits Suicide which is from the Greatest of Sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves, indeed Allaah is Most Merciful to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah. If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall remit from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden……&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">191 – Narrated by Jundub ibn Abdullaah <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said, “Amongst the nations before you was a man who had a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop until he died. Allaah said, ‘My Slave hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">192 – Narrated Abu Huraira <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever; “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">193 – In an authentic hadeeth: A person was wounded, he hurried death and killed himself with the tip of his sword, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “He is from the people of the fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">194 – It is narrated on the authority of Yahya bin Abee Katheer, on the authority of Abee Qilaaba, on the authority of Thabit bin al-Dahhak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  said : “Cursing a believer is like killing him, and whoever accuses a believer of <em>Kufr</em> then he is like his killer, and he who killed himself with something in this world then Allaah will punish him with that (very thing) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar:</strong> ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Lecture:</strong> Ta’sîl-ul-Intimâ’ wal-Muwâtanah ash-Shar´iyyah<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> alfawzan.ws/allmohadrat?page=1<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> It is obligatory upon the Muslims to respect the governmental facilities and to take care of them and make sure that they develop. What should then be said about devastating facilities and to blow them up and the likes? Not even the mosques are safe from them anymore. They blow them up and throw bombs into them. They kill the people in their mosques. They blow up their buildings and facilities. In addition, they claim that it is from Jihâd for Allâh’s sake and that they are Mujâhidûn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One has to be aware of this and alert those who are deceived by these and think that this really is from Jihâd and that the deed is noble [while it absolutely is not]. The deed is in fact a destruction and Allâh does not love those who spread corruption. This is from spreading corruption upon the earth and Allâh does not love those who spread corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Morover, innocent people are killed. People whom Allâh has forbidden to kill without due right. They commit sins and they may even kill themselves. They blow themselves up and say that it is martyrdom. How can a self-killer be a martyr when the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said that he is in the Fire? Allâh (jalla wa ‘alâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. And whoever does that in aggression and injustice – then We will drive him into a Fire. And that, for Allah , is [always] easy.”</span> (4:29-30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said in the authentic Hadîth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who kills himself with poison will have it in his hand and drink it slowly and swallow it in hell. The one who kills himself with an iron will have the iron in the hand and stab himself with it in hell. The one who kills himself by throwing himself down a mountain will be thrown down into hell.”</span> (Muslim 175)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A self-killer has done a Kabîrah (great sin). How can he be a martyr? How can one say that he is going to paradise when the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said that he is going to the Fire? Allâh allowed martyrdom to be reached if one dies for His sake. THEY (MARTYRS) ARE KILLED. They were killed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead.”</span> (3:169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And do not say about those who are killed in the way of Allah , “They are dead.” Rather, they are alive”</span> (2:154)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the one who dies in Jihâd under the banner of the Muslims who is a martyr. The one who is killed by the enemy. As for the person who takes his own life, he has done a great sin and risks ending up in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was asked about the person who fights with vigilance, courage and so on and who from among them fights for Allah’s sake, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who fights so that the word of Allâh shall be the highest fights for Allâh’s sake.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter should be referred to the word of Allâh and His messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and not to deviant destroyers who brainwash people and give them these foul opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That they destroy the administrations and facilities of the country and even the mosques goes to show that they have nothing to do with Jihâd for Allâh’s sake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one risks being cursed for having urinated on the road or in the shadow of a tree, one may ask how the matter is if one blows up buildings with people in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are obliged to repent before Allâh (‘azza wa jall) and to see the difference between friend and enemy and to learn beneficial knowledge by which Allâh guides them with to the straight way. They should not take knowledge from misleading people.</p>
