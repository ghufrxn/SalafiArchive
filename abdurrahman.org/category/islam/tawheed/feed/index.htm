<p>When the Hearts Are Not Filled With the Love of Allah &#8211; Shaykh Saleh Ale ash Shaykh حفظه الله [Video|En subtitles] &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEyqTpu3ho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEyqTpu3ho</a> [1:32 min]<br /><br />Shortcomings in worship, the absence of humility and submission, committing evil actions, falling into the impermissible, and falling short in the obligations only occur when the love of Allah is not filled in the hearts.</p>



<p>And when He is not exalted with the utmost exaltation and He is not feared.</p>



<p>The more the individual contemplates and looks, the more he will know the signs that show that Allah alone is the Lord and He is the One administering, meaning, that which is included in Tawhid al-Rububiyyah- and that everything is in His Hands.</p>



<p>The more these hearts are filled and are submissive and humbled, even if all of mankind plotted, they wouldn&#8217;t pay any attention to it.</p>



<p>The absence of giving importance to the understanding of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah leads to weakness in the hearts towards the people and weakness in the hearts in holding fast to the religion.</p>



<p>And one&#8217;s submission will be weak because he doesn&#8217;t exalt Allah and he doesn&#8217;t see the marvelous creation of Allah in everything.</p>



<p>And the individual said well when he said: And in everything has a sign that shows that He is One.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on amulets consisting of the Qur’an and other things? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amulets that consist of other than the Qur’an such as bones, talismans, cowrie shells, wolf’s hair and the like are all evil and Haram (prohibited) by the Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah)</strong></span>. It is not permissible to hang them on anybody or anything, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfill it (i.e., their purpose) for them, and whoever wears a cowrie shell, may Allah not give them peace.” And in another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet has committed Shirk (associated others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if amulets consist of the Qur’an or well­known good supplications, this is a controversial matter among the scholars. Some say that such amulets are permissible. This opinion was reported from a group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who likened it to recitation (of some Qur’anic Ayahs and supplications) over sick people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others say that it is not permissible. This opinion is supported by ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and Hudhaifah (may Allah be pleased with them both). A group of the Salaf and the righteous successors said it is not permissible to tie amulets even if they are from the Qur’an in accordance with the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>principle of Sadd­ul­Dhara’i (blocking the means leading to sins)</strong> </span>and to forestall acts of Shirk and to act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths. This is because the Hadiths that prohibit amulets are general and make no exception. Muslims should abide by the general ruling. Therefore, it is basically not permissible to use any kind of amulets in order not to permit people to use some other types of amulets, thus leading to confusing matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to prohibit all types of amulets and this is the soundest opinion for the obvious evidence supporting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If we permit the use of amulets made from the Qur’an and good supplications, it will open the door for people to wear any form of amulets they like</strong></span>. Then, if they are reproved for what they do, they will say that they are amulets consisting of the Qur’an or good supplications. Consequently, the door will be opened, the hole will expand and all types of amulets (whether from the Qur’an or anything else) will be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is another reason for their prohibition, which is the fact that people may enter the bathroom and other unclean places while wearing them</strong></span>. It is well­known that the Words of Allah (the Qur’an) are too sacred to be in such places and it is not appropriate to take them into bathrooms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">CHAPTER No: 25</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>بيان شيء من أنواع السحر</strong></span></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Clarification of types of Sorcery (As-Sihr)</strong></span></p>



<p>Imam Ahmad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Muhammad bin Ja&#8217;far narrated from Auf, from Haiyan bin Al- `Ala&#8217;, from Qatan bin Qabisah, from his father that he heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) say:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إن العيافة والطرق والطيرة من الجبت</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Al-Iyafah (letting birds fly to foretell events) and At-Tarq (drawing lines on earth to predict events) and At-Tiyarah (taking sight on some object as a bad omen) are Al-Jibt (sorceries/magic).&#8221;</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">`Auf (رضي الله عنه) said,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العيافة: زجر الطير، والطرق: الخط يخط بالأرض والجبت</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Al-&#8216;Iyafah is letting a bird&#8217;s flight foretell events while At-Tarq is drawing line on earth.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>Hasan Basri (May Allah be pleased with him) said,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>والجبت </strong><strong>رنة الشيطان</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Al- Jibt is the scream of Satan (devil).&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>The above Hadith has been narrated through good chain of narrators and collected by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Hibban.</p>



<p>Abu Dawud reported in his book with Sahih lsnad that Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>من اقتبس شعبة من النجوم، فقد اقتبس شعبة من السحر، زاد ما زاد</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever learns a part of astrology (drawing knowledge from stars) has learned a part of sorcery (magic). Those who learn more are getting that much more (sin to their credit).&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>In An-Nasa&#8217;i, Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) is reported to have said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>من عقد عقدة ثم نفث فيها فقد سحر، ومن سحر فقد أشرك، ومن تعلق شيئاً وكل إليه</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever tied a knot and blew on it, has committed sorcery and whoever committed sorcery has committed Shirk. Whoever wears an amulet or talisman will be subjected to its control.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (رضي الله عنه) is reported to have heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ألا هل أنبئكم ما الغضة؟ هي النميمة، القالة بين الناس</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Shall I not tell you what Al-&#8216;Adh (literally: lying, sorcery etc.) is? It is conveying false rumors for the purpose of causing disputes between people.&#8221;</span> </strong>(Muslim)</p>



<p>Both Sahih collectors reported from Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إن من البيان لسحراً</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Some eloquence can be (so beautiful that it constitutes) sorcery.”</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Important issues of the Chapter</span></strong></p>



<p>1) Al-&#8216;Iyafah, At-Tarq, At-Tiyarah are three kinds of Al-Jibt (sorcery/magic).<br />2) Al-&#8216;Iyafah, and At-Tarq are explained.<br />3) Astrology too is a kind of sorcery.<br />4) Tying knots and blowing over them is also sorcery.<br />5) An-Namimah (tale bearing, backbiting) is also a form of sorcery.<br />6) Talking sometimes superfluously and eloquently can too be sorcery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Section Three: The Second Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></p>



<p><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>



<p><strong>The Second Rule:</strong> They (i.e. the disbelievers) said: “We did not invoke them nor turn towards them except to seek nearness (to Allah) and (their) intercession. The proof for their seeking nearness (to Allaah) is His saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَفَّارٌ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And those who take protectors besides Him (say): ‘We don’t worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.’ Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differ in. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>



<p>The proof for their seeking intercession is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: ‘These are our intercessors besides Allaah.’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>



<p>Intercession is of two types: Intercession that is negated and Intercession that is affirmed.</p>



<p>The Negated Intercession is that which is sought from someone other than Allaah in matters that no one has the ability to carry out except Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah Al- Baqarah: 254]</p>



<p>The Affirmed Intercession is that which is sought from Allaah. The intercessor is one who is granted the honor of being able to intercede (by Allaah), while the one who is interceded for is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions. (All of these occur) after Allaah’s permission is granted, as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]</p>

<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color: #993300" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>



<p><strong>Language</strong>:</p>



<p><em><strong>Zulfaa</strong> </em>means closeness; <em><strong>Shufa’aaunaa</strong> </em>(our intercessors) is the plural of <em><strong>shaafi</strong></em>’ and <em><strong>shafee</strong></em>’, and he is the one that gets in between (two parties) in order to bring some benefit or to repel some harm; <em><strong>Khillah</strong> </em>(friendship) mutual love.</p>



<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>



<p>These disbelievers used as an argument for their supplicating and worshipping of other gods besides Allaah, the claim that they did not call unto them nor turn to them except for two reasons.</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>: So that these things (i.e. false gods) that they were worshipping could bring them nearer to Allaah. And Second: So that they may intercede for them before Allaah.</p>



<p>The proof for the first reason is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And those who take protectors besides Him (say): ‘We don’t worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.’”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>



<p>Meaning: We only supplicated to them and worshipped them so that they may serve as a means to gain nearness to Allaah and attain a high position with Him.</p>



<p>The proof for the second reason is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: These are our intercessors besides Allaah.”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>



<p>Meaning: We only worshipped them so that they may intercede for us before Allaah in bringing about some good or repelling some harm.</p>



<p>Then the Shaikh explains that Intercession is of two types in the Book of Allaah. The first is an intercession that the Qur’aan has negated, rejected and restricted that it be achieved. And the second type is the Affirmed Intercession, which the Qur’aan has affirmed will occur on the Day of Judgement, based on the clear evidences.</p>



<p>As for the Intercession that Allaah has negated in His Book, when He said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 254]</p>



<p>then it is the Intercession that is sought from other than Allaah in matters that no one has control over except Allaah, such as a person who seeks entrance into Paradise from other than Allaah, for example, or to be saved from the Hellfire. What also falls into the Negated Intercession is the Intercession that is done for those whom Allaah did not permit that intercession be granted to, such as the disbelievers, or the Intercession from someone that Allaah did not allow to intercede. As for the Affirmed Intercession, then it is that which is sought from Allaah and which occurs with His permission. So the one who intercedes, Allaah has granted him the honor of interceding. As for the one who is interceded for, he is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions, after He has given His permission for him to be interceded for.</p>



<p>This is as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]</p>



<p>The true intercession, which is the affirmed one cannot occur unless two conditions are first met:</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>: Permission for the intercessor to intercede, as is stated in the previous ayah.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>: Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for. This is as is stated in Allaah’s statement:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000"> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ وَهُم مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they cannot intercede except for he whom Allaah is pleased with. And they stand in awe from fear of Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 28]</p>



<p>So due to this, all of the Intercession occurs by Allaah’s Permission and it is all in His Hand and Command, as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">قُل لِّلَّهِ الشَّفَاعَةُ جَمِيعًا</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Say: To Allaah belongs all of the intercession.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 44]</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>1. The disbelievers worshipped false gods besides Allaah seeking nearness (to Allaah) and intercession (from them) before Allaah.</p>



<p>2. Having good intention is not sufficient in the absence of following of the Sunnah.</p>



<p>3. Intercession is of two types: Affirmed and Negated.</p>



<p>4. The Conditions for Intercession are: (a) permission must be granted to the intercessor and (b) Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for.</p>



<p><strong>Examination:</strong></p>



<p>1. What is it that caused the disbelievers to worship other than Allaah? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>



<p>2. What are the types of Intercession? Give one proof for each type.</p>



<p>3. What are the conditions for the Affirmed Intercession?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Section Five: The Fourth Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Rule:</strong> The polytheists in our era are more severe in their (committing of) Shirk than the first polytheists (during the Prophet’s time). This was since the first polytheists used to ascribe partners to Allaah at times of ease and worship Him sincerely during times of hardship. However, the polytheists in our era constantly commit Shirk in times of ease as well as in times of hardship. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.”</span> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Aghladh</strong> </em>(more severe) greater and stronger; <em><strong>Rakhaa</strong> </em>(times of ease) times of comfort and blessing; <em><strong>Shiddah</strong> </em>(hardship) difficulty and times when tribulations befall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth and last rule, which is that the polytheists in our time, those who devote a share of their worship to other than Allaah, such as the righteous people that are buried in graves and so on. These people are greater in Shirk and stronger in disbelief than the first polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is because the first polytheists would ascribe partners to Allaah during times of ease only, and as for times of hardness and difficulty, they would call sincerely out to Allaah (for help) and they knew that no one else could save them and that their (false) gods would not benefit them. What indicates this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.”</span> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُم مِّن ظُلُمَاتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً لَّئِنْ أَنجَانَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ اللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُم مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea (when) you call upon Him in humility and in secret (saying): ‘If He only saves us from this (danger), we will truly be grateful.’ Say: Allaah rescues you from this and from all other distresses, but yet you worship others besides Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al- An’aam: 63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ayaat</em> (verses) indicate that they would mix partners in their worship with Allaah during times of ease only. But as for times of hardship then they wouldn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for those who commit Shirk in our time, then they indeed mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both these conditions. If some blessing and comfort befalls them, they rush to the graves, presenting them with sacrificial offerings and slaughtering animals at their sites. And they put forth thanks to the deceased buried within them and glorify them with praises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if some calamity befalls them, they rush to these graves and seek help from them, supplicating to them and making oaths to them for such and such if this calamity is removed from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We see this clearly going on at the graves that are worshipped besides Allaah, such as the grave sites of Husayn, Sayyidah Zaynab, ‘Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaani, Sayyid Al- Badawee and others.</strong> So it is clear that the Shirk that is committed by these latter-day polytheists is greater and worse than the Shirk that was done by the polytheists of old because it is a Shirk that is done constantly under every condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this completes the objective of this treatise, thus all praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Summary</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists of old used to mix partners in Allaah’s worship during times of ease and turn to Him in sincere worship during times of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The polytheists of this era mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The polytheists in our time are greater in their Shirk than the first polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Examination</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the difference between the polytheists in our time and the polytheists of old times?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Which of the two is greater in their Shirk: the polytheists of old or the polytheists of our time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the proof that the polytheists of old would commit Shirk during times of ease and not during times of hardship?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Section Four: The Third Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Third Rule:</span> </strong>The Prophet was sent to people that differed from one another in their worship. Among them were those who worshipped the angels. And among them were those who worshipped the prophets and righteous people. And among them were those who worshipped trees and stones. And among them were those who worshipped the sun and the moon. However, the Messenger of Allaah fought against (all of) them and did not differentiate between any of them. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (trial, i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah alone.”</span> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of them worshipping the sun and the moon is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.”</span> [Surah Fussilat: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the angels is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the prophets is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when Allaah will say: ‘O ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You, it is not for me to say what I have no right to say. Had I said such a thing, You would have surely known it. You know what is in my inner self yet I do not know what is in Your self. Verily, You re the All-Knower of the Unseen.’”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the righteous people is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.”</span> [Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped trees and stones is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “Have you then considered Al-Laat and Al-‘Uzzaa, and Manaat, the third other?”</span> [Surah An-Najm: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translator’s Note: These three are names of stone idols that the pagan Arabs used to worship. They were originally righteous men who after their deaths and after many generations began to be worshipped.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid Al-Laythee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“We went out with Allaah’s Messenger to (the Battle of) Hunayn, and we had just recently come out of Kufr (Disbelief). The polytheists used to have a lote-tree, which they would organize by and hang their swords on (seeking blessings from it); it was called Dhaat Anwaat. So we passed by a lote-tree and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make for us a Dhaat Anwaat, just as they have a Dhaat Anwaat?’”</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Language:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fitnah (tribulation) here means Shirk; ‘<em><strong>alaamaat</strong> </em>(signs) proofs and indicators; <em><strong>yabtaghoon</strong> </em>(they seek) they look for; <em><strong>hudathaa ‘ahdin</strong> </em>(recently come out) close to that time; <em><strong>sidrah</strong> </em>(lote-tree); <em><strong>yanootoon</strong> </em>(hang on) cling onto.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was indeed sent to a people who varied in their worship and differed in their religions. Among them were those that worshipped angels and (those that worshipped) prophets and righteous people, and those that worshipped trees and stones or the sun and the moon. So Allaah legislated for His Prophet to fight against them. Rather, He commanded him to do that without differentiating between any of them. He commanded him to fight against every one of them until all of the Religion (i.e. worship) became solely for Allaah and until islaam gained supremacy over all other religions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) fought against all of them until he brought them under the rule and laws of Islaam. From the texts that provide evidence that there existed those who worshipped the sun and the moon and that Allaah forbade them from doing that is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.”</span> [Surah Fussilat: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences that indicate that there existed those who used to worship the angels, and that Allaah forbade them from doing that, is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from what makes it clear that there existed those who would worship the prophets and that this worship of theirs was false is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when Allaah will say: ‘O ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You.”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ‘Eesaa, peace be on him, will free himself from their worshipping of him and rule upon its falsehood. And from the proofs that show that there existed those who would worship the righteous people and the ruling that this is futile, is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.”</span> [Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars of Tafseer said: There was a group amongst the Arabs that used to worship some individuals amongst the Jinn. Afterward, these Jinn accepted Islaam, but those people who worshipped them did not know this. So Allaah explains to them that those people whom you worship, they themselves seek nearness to Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which indicates that there existed those who would worship the stones is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you then considered Al-Laat and Al-‘Uzzaa, and Manaat, the third other?”</span> [Surah An-Najm: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were (false) gods that the polytheists of Makkah used to worship. They were statues that they had constructed and worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which indicates that there existed those who would worship trees is the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid Al-Laythee (radyAllaah ‘anhu) when some of the Companions went out with the Prophet during the battle of Hunayn. And among them were those who had just recently come out of disbelief, i.e. they had only become Muslims a little while before. So they saw a lote-tree that belonged to the polytheists, known as Dhaat Anwaat, which the polytheists would seek blessings from and hang their swords on. So they asked the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) to make for them a Dhaat Anwaat tree just like theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this the Prophet said Allaahu Akbar, became very angry and was stern in his speech, forbidding them from this. He said to them: <span style="color:#808000;">“You have just said, by the One in whose hand my soul is, similar to what the companions of Moosaa said to him: ‘Make for us a god just as they have gods.’ He replied: ‘Verily you are a people given into ignorance.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad (5/218), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq (20763), At-Tayaalisee (1346), Al-Humaydee (848), At- Tirmidhee (2180) who said of it: “hasan saheeh” and others.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth proves that there existed those polytheists who would worship trees. It also proves that believing in trees (i.e. that they have the ability to bring good or repel harm) amounts to disbelief. It also proves that even the noble and scholarly amongst people may fall into Shirk, while not being aware of it. It also proves that if a person utters a statement of disbelief while not knowing that it amounts to disbelief or intentionally doing it, he does not commit disbelief until he is fully aware (of what he is saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has declared all of these different types of worship false and futile. And He commanded His Messenger to fight against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent to various people with different religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. A Muslim does not commit disbelief by making a statement of disbelief if he says it unknowingly and unintentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The truth may be unknown at times to the high ranking amongst people, not to mention the common folk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. State some of the types of worship that existed at the time of the Prophet’s advent, giving one proof for each type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Did the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) distinguish between the adherents of these various religions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What points of benefit can we derive from the hadeeth mentioned in this chapter?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Rule:</strong> You must know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allaah fought against agreed that Allaah was the Creator and the Administrator. But this (belief) did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ ۚ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Muqirroon</em> </strong>(agreed) means they acknowledged; <em><strong>Al-Mudabbir</strong> </em>(Administrator) The One who disposes of all affairs; <em><strong>tattaqoon</strong> </em>(dutiful) means putting a shield and a barrier between yourselves and what you fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these rules is: Knowing that the polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger, from the disbelievers of Makkah and others, affirmed and acknowledged Allaah’s Lordship (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>), which is to single Allaah out and make Him one with regard to His creating, administering and controlling of the universe. They did not ascribe partners to Him in these aspects. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also His saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you ask them: ‘Who created the heavens and the earth (?)’, they will certainly say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘All praise be to Allaah.’ But most of them know not.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>ayaat</em> that provide evidence for this are many. All of them make it clear that the polytheists acknowledged that Allaah alone was the only Creator, Provider and Administrator of all affairs. However, they ascribed and mixed partners with Him in worship, so this acknowledgement was of no benefit to them. And this did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam nor did it make their lives and wealth sacred (i.e. unlawful to be violated). Rather, the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against them and made lawful (the taking of) their lives and their wealth because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were <strong>not</strong> judged as being Muslims simply because they acknowledged and agreed to Allaah’s Lordship. Rather he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) made their abiding by T<em>awheed Al-Uloohiyyah</em> (i.e. that worship is only for Allaah), acknowledging it and acting upon it as a condition for judging them as Muslims, withholding from causing harm to them, and sparing their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Summary<span style="color:#993300;">:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger used to affirm and acknowledge Allaah’s Lordship (i.e. that He was the sole Creator and Administrator)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Acknowledging that Allaah is the one and only Lord (i.e. <em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) is not sufficient to affirm that an individual be judged as a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examination</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What was the stance the polytheists during the time of the Prophet took with regard to Allaah’s Lordship? Bring three ayaat that prove what you say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What was the stance Allaah’s Messenger took with regard to these polytheists during his time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Is acknowledging that Allaah is the sole Creator and Administrator (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) enough to affirm that someone is Muslim? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Shirk?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have already studied Tawḥīd. However, to truly understand Tawḥīd, its opposite, Shirk, must also be understood. The greatest thing Allah has commanded us to do is worship him alone, and the greatest sin he has forbidden is Shirk as He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is Shirk? Shirk (شِرْك) is an Arabic word which means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sharing something with others that only Allah deserves</strong></span>. Worshipping others along with Allah is the main type of Shirk. The verse above means we must worship Allah and only him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships someone or something instead of Allah, he is a disbeliever in Allah who has refused to worship him alone. If someone worships Him but also worships someone else along with Allah, he is still a disbeliever in Allah, and it is this person who makes Shirk. As for someone who worships Allah alone, he is a Muslim who sincerely believes in Tawḥīd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest sin against Allah and he says about it:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly made up a great sin</span>.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the worst of all major sins. Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once asked his companions:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Should I tell you the greatest of all major sins?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions said, “Of course, messenger of Allah.” He then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الإِشْرَاكُ بِاللَّهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ أَوْ قَوْلُ الزُّورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Making Shirk with Allah, disobeying parents, and lying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was laying back when he said that, but then he sat up and began repeating that over and over because of how serious Shirk and those other major sins are in Islam. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was also asked, “What is the greatest sin?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ تَجْعَلَ لِلَّهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">That you make something equal to Allah while he is the (only) one who created you.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making someone or something equal to Allah is Shirk. It is to belittle Allah, believing him to be less than He is while believing others are equal to Him. About this, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Those who disbelieve think others are equal to their Lord.</span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Allah lets people choose to make Shirk and believe others are equal to Him, He does not like it and forbids us from doing so:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not make anything equal with Allah while you know (that he alone should be worshipped).</span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also to deny the very reason Allah created us which was to worship him alone as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">I only created Jinn and people to worship me.</span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships others along with Allah, believing they deserve to be worshipped, they have made the creation equal to its creator. This is the worse comparison because it is to believe that people who are helpless and in need are equal to Allah, the one who is able to do anything and who needs nothing from any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest crime of injustice and unfairness. This is because the greatest rights are the rights Allah deserves. Yet when people make Shirk, they are refusing to give him what he deserves most &#8211; Tawḥīd. This is the greatest form of injustice and unfairness just like Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shirk is certainly a great crime of injustice.</span>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the greatest form of misguidance and straying from the right way of believing in Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلالاً بَعِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly gone far astray.</span>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Shirk is to share something that only Allah deserves with others such as worshipping others or describing others with Allah’s descriptions. It is the greatest sin against Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Review</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Allah’s greatest command to us?<br />
2. What is the greatest sin against Allah?<br />
3. Explain in your own words the meaning of Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF LORDSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you learned about Tawḥīd, you may remember there are three main categories. Let us review the categories of Tawḥīd before moving on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Tawḥīd of Lordship: Allah is the only one who creates, owns, and controls everything.<br />
2. Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions: Allah is the only one who is described with his perfect names and descriptions.<br />
3. Tawḥīd of Worship: Allah is the only one who deserves worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship is to believe that others besides Allah create or share control over his creation. This belief means that someone other than Allah can make good things happen or keep bad things from happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One example of this type of Shirk is to believe something brings good luck. People often have “good luck” rings or similar items they believe will help good things happen to them. Others tie special strings around them or their children, believing that if they recite the Qur&#8217;aan over the strings, they will protect from bad things happening. However, only Allah can protect us from bad things and we should only seek his protection in ways he mentions in the Qur&#8217;aan or the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us in the ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another common example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship today is when people believe others like themselves who are created and have no control in Allah’s universe can control what happens. Such people even wait until the ones they believe in are dead before worshipping them by praying to them. The act of praying to dead people is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship (which we will cover shortly), but the belief itself is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship because when people pray to dead people, they believe the souls of humans can control things in this life even after their death. This is completely wrong because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When a person dies, his actions come to an end except for (receiving rewards for) three things: continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a person may still receive rewards from Allah for things he left behind after he died, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly told us that after death, a human being’s actions stop. So how can dead people control whether good and bad things happen in life when they are not even in life anymore? Still, some people continue to pray to the dead, asking for their help in changing events in this life although only Allah can do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a dead person was a righteous worshipper of Allah, believing that dead people or anyone else controls things in this life is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Review</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship?<br />
2. Give an example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is to believe that Allah is the only one who deserves to be described with perfect names and descriptions. Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd is to believe that Allah can be described with descriptions of the creation, or to believe that others besides Allah share in his descriptions. So believing that Allah is like his creation or that his creation is like Allah is Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Allah with Descriptions of His Creation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people describe Allah with the descriptions of creation or they believe Allah is similar to people, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. There are several ways this type of Shirk is made. One example is when people make statues or paintings of God, claiming they are images of Allah. By doing so, they have described Allah in the image or form of people although Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like him.</span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, Christians fall into this type of Shirk when they believe Allah has a son. They believe the Messiah, Prophet Jesus the son of Mary, is his son. Allah knows they believe this and he says about this statement of Shirk and disbelief:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">تَكَادُ السَّمَاوَاتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “The Most-Merciful has a son.” You have said a terrible thing. The heavens are almost torn, the earth is split open, and the mountains almost fall in ruin because they claim the Most-Merciful has a son. But it is not suitable that the Most-Merciful has a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth except that will come to the Most-Merciful as a servant. </span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah explains who Prophet Jesus truly is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah.</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is when many Jewish people claim that Allah likes the Jews more than all other people – just because they were born to a Jewish parent. This belief of theirs means that Allah is prejudice and unfair just like some people are, and this is describing Allah with descriptions of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our belief in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is that Allah is not like his creation. He alone deserves the highest descriptions. When someone believes that Allah is like his creation, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions by giving Allah the descriptions of his creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Creation with Allah’s Descriptions</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief that created beings or things share Allah’s names or descriptions is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. This type of Shirk is when people raise other humans up to the level of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, some Christians describe people with Allah’s descriptions. They believe Prophet Jesus or saints can hear their prayers while Allah alone is the All-Hearing. Some Christians even believe Jesus was Allah in the form of a man. This is a form of describing Allah with descriptions of people as well as describing the creation with the descriptions of Allah. About this statement of Shirk and disbelief, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They have surely disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By believing that someone is nicer than Allah, more merciful, more forgiving, or treats others more fairly than Allah, this is giving created people Allah’s descriptions and this is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF WORSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Worship means we believe Allah is the only one who deserves worship. Since Shirk is the opposite of Tawḥīd, Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship is worshipping others along with Allah. We must never share our worship with other than Allah. There are two types of Shirk in this category: Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to remember that both types of Shirk, major and minor, may be in other categories of Tawḥīd as well as Tawḥīd of Worship. We should not become overwhelmed or confused deciding if a statement or action is Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd or that one. Instead, we simply should concentrate on believing in, describing, and worshipping Allah alone as Islam instructs us. Still, we will discuss some differences between Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major Shirk is any type of Shirk the Qur&#8217;aan or the ḥadīth explains that whoever does it is not considered a Muslim, not within the religion of Islam, and is not a true believer in Allah. Major Shirk dooms the person to live in Hell forever if he does not stop making Major Shirk before he dies. Any form of worship that is done for other than Allah is Major Shirk, such as praying to others besides Allah or hoping for things from others that only Allah can give (e.g. forgiveness, Paradise, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A common example of Major Shirk is when people pray to other people such as prophets or visit the graves of saints, believing those people hear or answer prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This form of Shirk is the greatest sin and the most unfair way to behave toward the Lord of all creation. We will mention some of the results of Major Shirk if a person dies while believing in it and doing acts of Major Shirk in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk Removes Hope of Entering Paradise</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about the punishment for someone who dies while making Major Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, whoever makes Shirk with Allah, Allah will make Paradise forbidden to him and his final home will be the fire.</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Guarantees Entrance into the Fire</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said about someone who meets Allah while making Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ لَقِيَ اللهَ لا يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ ، وَمَنْ لَقِيَهُ يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ النَّار</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever meets Allah without making Shirk with him will enter Paradise, and whoever meets him making Shirk with him will enter the fire</span>. [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will meet Allah when we die, and one of the most common ways people make Major Shirk is by praying to and calling upon someone other than Allah. For this reason, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ مَاتَ وَهْوَ يَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ نِدًّا دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever dies while calling upon anything other than Allah, making them equal to Allah (in worship), he will enter the fire.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Ruins All Good Deeds</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone makes Major Shirk, all their good deeds may be ruined and lost. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if they had made Shirk, whatever (good) they used to do would be ruined.</span> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It has been revealed to you and to those before you, if you make Shirk, your deeds will be ruined and you will certainly be among the losers.</span>[20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Minor Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Minor Shirk is any type of saying or action that the Qur&#8217;aan or ḥadīth describes as being Shirk but that the person who says or does it could still be considered a Muslim, still inIslam, and is still a believer in Allah. However, Minor Shirk does mean that the person’s belief in Tawḥīd may be incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some actions or statements are considered Minor Shirk. For example, saying something like, “If it was not for Allah and you, something bad would have happened!” Someone once said to Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), “Whatever Allah wants and you want (to happen will happen).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained that such things are not correct to say; he said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلْتَنِي مَعَ اللهِ عَدْلاً ؟ لا بَلْ : مَا شَاءَ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Have you made me an equal with Allah? No, instead say: “Whatever Allah alone wants (to happen will happen).”</span> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some common superstitions are also Minor Shirk. For example, if someone believes Allah will allow bad things to happen if he does not wear a certain ring or hang verses from the Qur&#8217;aan in his car, this is a form of Minor Shirk because Allah has not made those things ways to prevent bad things from happening. However, if someone believes those things themselves actually prevent bad things from happening instead of Allah, then this becomes Major Shirk. Such a wrong belief would then mean there are other things besides Allah that control creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of Minor Shirk is harder to recognize. This type of “hidden Shirk” is in a person’s intention, or the reason he does something. When someone does a good deed—which he should do for only Allah—yet he does his good deed just for people to think he is a good worshipper, this is a form of Minor Shirk. Examples of this may be if someone prays very well, raises his voice while remembering Allah or reading the Qur&#8217;aan, or gives charity but he does so only for people to think and say good things about him. About this type of showing off, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ الشِّرْكَ الأَصْغَرَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The thing I fear for you the most is Minor Shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions asked, “What is Minor Shirk, messenger of Allah?” He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّيَاء ، يَقُوْلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ : اِذْهَبُوْا إِلَى الَّذِيْنَ كُنْتُمْ تُرَاؤُوْنَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ،فَانْظُرُوْا هَلْ تَجِدُوْنَ عِنْدَهُمْ جَزَاءً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Showing off (riyā). Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) will say, <span style="color:#008000;">“Go to those you were showing off for during life and see if you can find any reward with them.”</span></span> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Minor Shirk Ruins Good Deeds Done for Showing Off</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Good deeds will not be accepted if they are done for anyone other than Allah. While Major Shirk ruins all a person’s good deeds, Minor Shirk ruins only the deeds that were done for showing off. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) says about this Shirk in intention:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : أَنَا أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنْ الشِّرْكِ ، مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلاً أَشْرَكَ فِيهِ مَعِي غَيْرِي تَرَكْتُهُ وَشِرْكَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah ( تبارك وتعالى ) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> “I am in no need of Shirk. Whoever does a deed but does so for someone else besides me, I will reject him and his Shirk”</span>.</span> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the prophet’s companions named Abū Mūsá al-‘Ash’arī ( رضي الله عنه ) said: The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once gave us a talk and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ، اتَّقُوا هَذَا الشِّرْكَ فَإِنَّهُ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh people, be afraid of this Shirk because it is more hidden than a creeping ant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Major Shirk is much worse than Minor Shirk, both are sins against Allah. For this reason, we should stay away from all forms of Shirk because Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah will not forgive that Shirk is made with him.</span> [24]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CONCLUSION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not study Tawḥīd and Shirk simply to memorize detailed categories and types of Shirk. We learn Tawḥīd for the purpose of getting closer to Allah by believing in and worshipping him in the way he wants. And we do so only to make him happy with the hope of achieving his forgiveness and entering his Paradise. Similarly, we learn Shirk so we know what beliefs, statements, and actions make Allah unhappy. Remember, while learning the details of Tawḥīd and Shirk may help us know what Allah wants from us, he did not make our religion difficult upon us, he simply instructed us to:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The important thing to remember is that Allah is the only Lord, the only creator, owner, and controller of everything and everyone in the universe. He is the only one who we describe with the names and descriptions of perfection and we truly believe Allah is not like his creation and his creation is not like him. Allah tells us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing equal or comparable to him.</span> [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we believe Allah is the only Lord and only he deserves the highest descriptions, it only makes sense that we worship him and no one else. So do not let your study of Tawḥīd and Shirk become difficult or confusing. By simply reading about this knowledge, you have taken steps to get closer to Allah. Read what Allah says about those who try to come closer to Allah and those who avoid Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but does not make Shirk in anything with me, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.” [27]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A PRAYER FOR PROTECTION FROM SHIRK</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشِّرْكُ فِيكُمْ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيْبِ النَّمْلِ ، وَسَأَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَيْ ء إِذَا فَعَلْتَهُ أَذْهَبَ عَنْكَ صِغَارَ الشِّرْكِ وَكِبَارَهُ ، تَقُولُ : اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Shirk among you is more hidden than a creeping ant, but I will guide you to something that, if you do it, will remove from you Minor Shirk and its Major type. You should say, “<strong>Oh Allah, I ask for your protection from making Shirk with you while I know, and I ask your forgiveness for what I do not know</strong>.”</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because our belief in Tawḥīd is that Allah is the only one who can help us and we only pray to him, we understand that only he can help us stay away from Shirk completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us to ask his protection from knowingly making Shirk in belief, statement, or action. We must also ask for his forgiveness if we happen to make a mistake by believing, saying, or doing anything that is Shirk that we may not know.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 4 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">iyyāka na’budu wa iyyāka nasta’īn</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You alone&#8221; (iyyāka)</strong>: This is a case in grammar when the direct object comes before the verb, <strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>. In Arabic grammar, when the direct object precedes the verb, it gives a sense of restriction, so the meaning would be, “<strong>We do not worship anyone or anything except you alone</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>: Meaning: We humble ourselves to you in complete humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, you find the believers placing the most honorable part of their bodies (their faces) at the level of their feet in humility to Allah (عزّ وجلّ). They prostrate on the ground, covering their foreheads with dirt. This is from their humbleness before Allah. And if another person were to say, “I will give you the whole world and what it contains, just prostrate to me once,” you will never find true believers accepting this because this type of humility is a form of worship specifically for Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “<strong>worship</strong>” includes doing everything Allah commands and avoiding everything he forbids. Whoever is not in accordance with this, not carrying out what he is commanded to do and avoiding what he is forbidden to do then he is not a true worshipper and servant. A worshipper is someone who obeys the one he worships in whatever he legislates. So, worship requires that mankind carry out everything they are commanded to do and avoid everything they are forbidden from doing. However, it is not possible to fulfill all of these duties without the help and assistance of Allah. Because of this, Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;and from you alone we seek help&#8221; (wa iyyāka nasta’īn)</strong>: Meaning, “We do not seek the help of anyone else in worship or in anything else.” This “seeking of help” is to request the help and assistance, and Allah combines between worship and the seeking of assistance or reliance in many places the noble Qur&#8217;an. This is because worship could not be completely established except with the help of Allah by entrusting one’s affairs to him, and relying on him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 4:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the virtues of this verse is the sincerity in worship that is due to Allah alone as he says, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8220;. It shows that this worship is due only to Allah by the direct object (“<strong>You</strong>”) coming before the verb (“<strong>we worship</strong>”) according to the rules of Arabic grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point is that seeking help is also sincerely and solely for Allah based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Likewise, the direct object precedes the verb indicating a sense of restriction just like in the first part of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those points being said, what if someone asks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">How is it that seeking help is exclusively for Allah alone when there has come in another verse:</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety</span>.[Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, how do we understand the previous statements about seeking help only from Allah when, here in this verse, Allah confirms that seeking help from other than himself is permissible (rather it is a command here)? Also, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> تُعِيْنُ الرَّجُلَ فِي دَابَّتِهِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُ عَلَيْهَا، أَوْ تَرْفَعُ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا مَتَاعَهُ صَدَقَةٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Helping someone onto his riding animal, carrying him on it, or lifting his belongings up to him while he is on it &#8211; all of these are (considered) acts of charity</span>. [Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2891) and Muslim (no. 1009)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this question is that the act of seeking help and assistance is of two types. The first type is to request help while entrusting all affairs to the one you ask from. For example, you rely completely on Allah and you realize that any result you seek will not come from your own power or capability. This type of seeking help is specific for Allah ( تعالى ); he alone deserves this type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type is to request help or cooperation in something you want to accomplish. This type is permissible as long as the one being requested is living and capable of doing what is asked of him. This is not considered a form of worship. This is the type that Allah refers to when saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety.</span> [Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is further asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Is seeking help from the creation permissible at all times and in all situations?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is no. Requesting help from the creation is only allowed when the one being asked is fully capable of what he is being asked for, otherwise seeking his help is not permissible. An example would be asking help from someone dead in his grave; this is prohibited, rather it is major Shirk (the associating of partners with Allah in worship)! This is because the person in his grave does not even have the ability to help himself, so how could he help someone else? Similarly, if someone seeks the help of another person who is not present with him such as a person believing that someone else in the far eastern part of the world could help him with something in his (the one seeking help) land – this is also major Shirk because the person whose help is sought is not capable of helping the seeker while they are in different lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is now asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So, is it permissible to seek help from the creation if these conditions are met?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that it is better not to ask anyone for any help unless it is absolutely necessary or if it is known that the person would be happy to provide help. In this case, one could request his assistance in order to please him. The act that you seek another’s help in fulfilling must also not be something sinful and prohibited.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Great Importance Given to the <em>’Aqeedah</em> in the Madinan Period</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions migrated to al-Madeenah, and the Islamic state was established through the efforts of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em>, and upon the foundation of <em>tawheed</em>, then the greatest importance continued to be given to <em>tawheed</em>. The <em>Aayaat</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan continued to be sent down with it, and the directions and the orders of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  revolved around it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  did not suffice even with all this. Rather he used to take pledge of allegiance from the greater Companions, not to mention the others, upon it from time to time. Whenever the opportunity arose, he would take their pledge of allegiance upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰ أَن لَّا يُشْرِكْنَ بِاللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَسْرِقْنَ وَلَا يَزْنِينَ وَلَا يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ وَلَا يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَانٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِي مَعْرُوفٍ ۙ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Believing women come to give you their pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with Allaah; nor steal; nor commit fornication; nor kill their children; nor attribute to their husbands children which are not theirs; nor disobey you, O Muhammad </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, in that which is good and commanded by Allaah; </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and not wail over the dead)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, then accept their pledge and ask Allaah to forgive them. Indeed Allaah forgives those who repent to Him and is Most Merciful to them.</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]  </a>Soorah al-Mumtahinah (60):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this <em>Aayah</em> is with regard to the women’s pledge, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  also used to take pledge from the men upon its contents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>) was in an assembly (of his Companions) and said, ‘Swear allegiance to me with the pledge that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, and that you will not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill your children, (and upon the Aayah which was taken as a pledge from the women [60:12]). So whoever fulfills this pledge from you, then he will be rewarded by Allaah. And whoever falls into sin with any of that and is punished for it, then it is an expiation for it. And whoever falls into any of these sins and Allaah conceals his sin, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He may forgive him, and if He wills He may punish him.’” </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Ibn Katheer quotes a large number of <em>ahaadeeth</em> that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take pledge from the women upon that which this <em>Aayah</em> contains.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> From these <em>ahaadeeth</em> is that of ’Aa’ishah; the <em>hadeeth </em>of Umayyah bint Ruqayqah;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Umm ’Atiyyah;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Salmaa bint Qays, one of the maternal aunts of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6)</a> and the <em>hadeeth </em>of Raa’itah bint Sufyaan al-Khuzaa’iyyah.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Then he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) said, “<strong>And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take this pledge from the women repeatedly</strong>.” Then he quoted the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Abbaas,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and other <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to take this pledge repeatedly from the men. This is indicated by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit which has preceded, and also by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Auf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’ee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“We were with Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>)  and numbered nine, eight or seven people, so he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we said, ‘We have already given you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah!’ Then he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we stretched out our hands and said, ‘We will indeed give you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah, but what will our pledge be?’ He said, ‘That you will worship Allaah and not worship anything else besides Him; the five obligatory Prayers; that you obey (and he said a word quietly); and that you do not ask the people for anything.’ So I have as a result seen some of those people, their whip would fall down from their hand (while riding) and he would not ask anyone to pick it up for him.” </em><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to send callers, teachers, judges and governors, to kings and tyrants, and to various areas, calling to <em>tawheed</em>. From Anas, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>the servant of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent letters to Kisraa (Chosroes), and Caesar, and the Najaashee (Negus) and to every tyrant ruler calling them to Allaah. And this Negus was not the one whom the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prayed Funeral Prayer for.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is shown very clearly by the text of his letter to the Caesar, and that his purpose was to call to <em>tawheed</em>. Its text is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Byzantines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and safety are for those who follow the Guidance. To proceed. I invite you with the call of Islaam. Accept Islaam and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a double reward. But if you turn your back upon it, then you will carry the burdens of the sins of your subjects.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, “Whoever calls to guidance then there is for him a reward similar to the reward of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their reward. And whoever calls to misguidance, then there is a burden of sin upon him similar to the sin of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O People of the Book, come to a word of justice between us, that we will single Allaah out with all worship and will not worship anything besides Him and disassociate ourselves from everything that is worshipped besides Him. Nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah by obeying one another in that which involves disobedience to Allaah. So if they turn away, then say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for Him and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</strong><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the letter reached the Caesar he sent for Aboo Sufyaan ibn Harb and some riders of Quraysh. They were at that time trading in the area of Palestine/Syria, and were within the time of the truce period agreed between Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and the unbelievers of Quraysh. So they came to Caesar at Jerusalem and he asked Aboo Sufyaan a number of questions. From them was that he asked, “What does he (i.e. Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ) command you?” Aboo Sufyaan said, “I replied, ‘He says, “<em>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else besides Him and abandon the saying of your fathers. He orders prayer, truthfulness, chastity and joining ties of relationship</em>.”’”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore he used to organise armies to fight <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah in order to establish and raise high the word of <em>tawheed</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who fights in order that Allaah’s Word is the highest then he is the one who is fighting in the Path of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah ibn al-Husayyib, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>, who said, “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  appointed the chief of a raiding party or an army, he used to counsel him to have taqwaa of Allaah concerning himself and with regard to good treatment of the Muslims with him, and he said, ‘When you meet your enemy from the mushriks then call them to accept one of three things, whichever of them they agree to, then accept it and leave them alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Invite them to accept Islaam. If they accept that then accept it from them, and leave them alone. Invite them in that case to leave their homes and to migrate to the land of the Muhaajirs&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) But if they refuse (to accept Islaam), then ask them to pay the <em>jizya</em> tax. If they agree to that then accept that from them and leave them alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) But if they refuse then seek the aid of Allaah and fight them. And if you besiege a fortified place and they ask you to allow them to surrender upon the judgement of Allaah, then do not allow them to surrender upon that since you do not know what Allaah’s judgement concerning them is. Rather allow them to surrender in accordance with what you judge in the matter. Then decide as you wish concerning them.’”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>hadeeth</em> of Buraydah is the <em>hadeeth</em> of an-Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin al-Muzanee, <em>radiyallaahu</em> <em>’anhu, </em>which is indicated by Muslim, Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah, who all said, “’Alqamah said: I narrated it to Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan. He said: Muslim ibn Haysam narrated to me, from an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Muqarrin from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  with its like.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Furthermore he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent Mu’aadh to Yemen as a Governor, a judge and a teacher. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“You are a going to a people from the People of the Book, so let the first thing you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, (and in a narration: that they should single Allaah out with all worship), and I am the Messenger of Allaah. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has made five Prayers obligatory upon them in each day and night. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them a charity which is to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they obey you in that, then beware of taking the best parts of their wealth, and beware of the supplication of the oppressed, because there is no screen between it and Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that he used to give this same advice to all the callers, governors and judges whom he sent out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <em>Jihaad </em>was prescribed for the establishment of <em>tawheed</em> and to purify the earth from the scourge of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Fight the <em>Mushriks</em> until there remains no worship of anything besides Allaah, and all worship is for Allaah alone and His religion is uppermost. So if they desist from <em>shirk</em> and enter into Islaam then let there be no transgression except those that worship others along with Allaah”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer (at-Tabaree),<em> rahimahullaah</em>, said in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/194-195):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High, says to His Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم),  Meaning: &#8220;so that there is no <em>shirk</em> with Allaah, and no one besides Him is worshipped; and worship of the idols, false gods and those set up as rivals is extinguished. And worship and obedience is for Allaah alone to the exclusion of idols and images&#8230; Qataadah said, ‘So that there is no <em>shirk</em>.’ He quotes his chain of narration with this explanation from Qataadah, Mujaahid, as-Suddee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. He said, ‘What is meant by <em>Deen </em>(religion) which Allaah mentions in this place is: Worship and obedience to Allaah in what He orders and forbids.’ He said, ‘With this meaning there occurs the saying of al-A’shee: He caused the (tribes of) ar-Ribaab to submit and become obedient when they hated obedience &#8211; Achieving it through continual fighting and attacks.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quoted his chain of narration of ar-Rabee’ who said concerning,  Meaning: “Until none but Allaah is worshipped,” which is the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). That is what Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  fought for and called to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say laa ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So whoever says: laa ilaaha illallaah, then his wealth and his person is safe from me, except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Chief of the Believers &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said to Aboo Bakr, the <em>Khaleefah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , when he resolved to fight the apostates and also those with them who refused to hand over the <em>zakaat</em>, ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “How can you fight those people when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘I have been ordered to fight the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so whoever says this then his wealth and his person are safe from me except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.’” So Aboo Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “By Allaah, I will fight those who seek to separate between the Prayer and the <em>zakaat</em>. Indeed the <em>Zakaat</em> is a right due upon wealth. By Allaah, were they to hold a single young goat from me which they used to pay to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , I would fight them for it.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir ibn ’Abdillaah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So when they say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah then their blood and their property are safe from me except due to a right pertaining to it, and their reckoning is with Allaah.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited,<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَا أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ  لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُصَيْطِرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed We have only sent you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), as an admonisher to them. You are not to force them to believe against their will</span>.”  [Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):21-22] <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, <a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they establish the Prayer, and pay the zakaat. So if they do that then their blood and their wealth are safe from me except due to its right, and their reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it may be noticed that the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of ’Umar, Aboo Bakr, Aboo Hurayrah and Jaabir are restricted to mentioning the matter of <em>tawheed</em> and do not mention the other matters. So perhaps the reason for this is the very great concern which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to this matter so that he would mention it to them time after time on its own, as an indication of its greatness and importance. Also because of the fact that he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  realised that they understood that all the other affairs of Islaam follow on from it, and are required by it and are from its rights, particularly the pillars of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, because of the fact that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  often used to mention only that which related to <em>‘aqeedah</em>, &#8216;Umar used this saying as an evidence. Then the reply of Aboo Bakr to support his stance, was to make a direct analogy between the <em>Zakaat</em> and the Prayer, “By Allaah, I will fight anyone who makes a difference between the Prayer and the <em>Zakaat</em>&#8230;” So if he knew the narration as it was reported by Ibn ’Umar he would have used that as a clear and decisive proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also if ’Umar knew of the narration as reported by his son he would not have raised any objection to the saying of Aboo Bakr. Then if those present at the time, included Aboo Hurayrah, knew the naration of Ibn ’Umar, then they would have mentioned it to the two <em>Shaykhs</em>.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> So perhaps the reason behind this was indeed as we have said, the great importance which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to <em>’aqeedah</em>, and his propogation of it, and the frequency with which he spoke about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also because the most prominent and most important aspect of the teachings which the Prophets conveyed from their Lord was <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship), and this was the greatest reason for strife between the Prophets and their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the most significant of the aspects of falsehood and misguidance, against which the Prophets (<em>’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>) fought, and which the <em>Mushriks</em> who denied the truth of their message furiously fought to defend, in every nation was: the worship of images and idols, and the building of tombs upon the graves of the pious and the Prophets, and veneration of them, and making offerings to them, and attachment of people’s hearts to them, both of the rulers and the ruled, an attachment of hope and fear, desiring and anticipating that they would intercede for them with Allaah, enabling the accomplishment of their wishes. This was indeed major <em>shirk</em> which will not be forgiven, so we must mention, along with that which we have already quoted whilst speaking about the methodology of the Prophets, particularly when we spoke concerning Ibraaheem, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Pious and the destroyer of the worthless idols, something about the full scale war which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  waged against major <em>shirk</em> which was seen in his smashing the idols physically and by blocking up all the ways which Satan uses to lead his followers to worshipping them and taking them as rivals to Allaah, by using the terms ‘gods’ or <em>awliyaa</em>&#8216; (pious ones beloved to Allaah) or hiding beneath any of the misleading titles they use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this war which is clearly seen in the Qur&#8217;aan and was waged by the Messenger of the One Who sent the Qur&#8217;aan, is the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ  وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ  أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الْأُنثَىٰ  تِلْكَ إِذًا قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰ  إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الْأَنفُسُ ۖ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Have you seen, O <em>Mushriks</em>, (the idols:) <em>al-Laat</em>, <em>al-’Uzzaa, </em>and the other one <em>Manaat</em>, the third of them</strong></span>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> You prefer and love the male offspring for yourselves and then falsely attribute daughters, which is something you hate for yourselves, to Allaah. This is indeed an unjust division. Rather these idols are mere names which you <em>Mushriks</em> and your forefathers have invented. Allaah has sent down no proof for that. Rather they follow only conjecture and their own deisres, even though clear guidance has come to them from their Lord proving the futility of worshipping these idols and that worship is the right of Allaah alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span style="color:#008000;">[24]</span></a><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>[Soorah an-Najm (53):19-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear statement of contempt for the idols which they worshipped, and war against them. Also, Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ اللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۗ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ  حُنَفَاءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So shun the filth of worshipping idols and shun false speech. Worshipping Allaah alone in <em>tawheed</em> making worship purely for Him, and not worshipping anything besides Him. And whoever worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is like one who fell down from the sky and was ripped to pieces by the birds, or like one cast by the wind in a far distant place.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> [Soorah al-Hajj (22):30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالْأَنصَابُ وَالْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars erected for sacrifice and divining-arrows are an abomination from the handiwork of Satan. So shun all of that so that you may be successful.”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> [ Soorah al-Maa’idah (5):90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from ’Amr ibn ’Abasah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>and his <em>hadeeth</em> has preceded, and in it there occurs, <em>“I said, ‘Did Allaah send you as a Messenger?’ He said, ‘Yes,’ I asked, ‘With what message did he send you?’ He replied, ‘That Allaah should be singled out and worshipped in tawheed, and that nothing should be worshipped besides Him, and to smash the idols and to join ties of relationship.’”</em><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the <em>hadeeth </em>of Ja’far which has preceded there occurs, “&#8230;until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage and his truthfulness and his chastity. He called us to single out Allaah in <em>tawheed</em> and to worship Him alone, and to renounce the stones and idols and whatever we and our fathers used to worship besides Him&#8230;”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth </em>of Aboo Sufyaan and his conversation with Heraclius, the King of the Byzantines, there occurs, “He says, (i.e., the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ), <em>‘Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything along with Him, and renounce what the forefathers say&#8230;’”</em><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Umaamah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>there occurs, <em>“Indeed Allaah sent me as a mercy for the worlds, and as a guide for the worlds, and my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, ordered me to destroy all musical instruments and flutes, and idols and the cross, and such things from the days of Ignorance&#8230;”</em><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of Quraysh went out of their minds in anger, unable to put up with the attack of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  against their idols, whether it was concerning the Qur&#8217;aan sent down to him, or his <em>da’wah</em> in secret, or his <em>da’wah</em> in the open. This was something about which there could be no indulgence, and it was something which had to be due to his true and sincere call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn ’Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa,</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“When Aboo Taalib became ill a group of Quraysh entered upon him, amongst them Aboo Jahl, and they said, ‘The son of your brother abuses our gods, and does such and such, and says such and such. So if only you were to send a message forbidding him.’ So he sent a message and the Prophet (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   came and entered the house&#8230; Aboo Taalib said to him, ‘O son of my brother! Why is it that your people complain about you? They claim that you abuse their idols and say such and such?!’ They spoke a great deal against him, and Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   spoke and said, ‘O Uncle! I only desire that they should say a single phrase which if they say it, then the Arabs will become obedient to them and the non-Arabs will pay the Jizyah tax to them.’ So they were very surprised at what he said and they said, ‘A single phrase? Yes, by your father, even ten.’ So they asked, ‘And what is it?’ Aboo Taalib said, ‘And which saying is it, O son of my brother?’ So he (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So they stood up, shaking their clothes saying, ‘Does he declare that worship should be for a single God?! this is something bizarre.’”</em><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Jaabir, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Quraysh gathered together one day and said, ‘See who is the most knowledgeable of you with regard to sorcery, divining and poetry, then let him go to this man who splits our united body, causes schism between us and abuses our religion. So let him speak to him and see how best to reply to him.’ So they said, ‘We do not know anyone but ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah.’ So they said, ‘Then it is to be you O Abul-Waleed.’ So ’Utbah went to him and said, ‘O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ! Are you better or ’Abdullaah?’<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. ‘Are you better or ’Abdul-Muttalib?’<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Again Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. So he said, ‘If you claim that they are better than you, then they certainly worshipped the idols which you abuse. If however you claim that you are better than them, then speak so that we may hear what you have to say. Indeed we have never seen a youngster who has boded evil for his people more so than yourself. You have split our unity and caused schism in our affair, and you have abused our religion and shamed us in front of the Arabs. It has spread amongst them that there is a sorceror within Quraysh, and a diviner within Quraysh. By Allaah we do not expect that we will have to wait for the time it takes a new-born to cry out before we will fight amongst oursleves with swords and wipe oursleves out. O man, if it is poverty that is your problem, then we will gather wealth for you until you will be the richest man of Quraysh. If it is that you have a need to marry, then choose whichever of the women of Quraysh you like and we will marry you ten of them.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘Have you finished?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until he reached</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حم  تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ&#8230;.  فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَاعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَاعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy &#8230;. So if these <em>mushriks</em> turn away from the proof which We have made clear to them, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , then say, ‘I warn you of a terrible punishment like that which befell ’Aad and Thamood.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  [Soorah Fussilat (41):1-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Utbah said, ‘Enough! Enough! Do you have nothing other than this?’ He said, ‘No.’ So he returned to Quraysh and they said, ‘What has occurred?’ He said, ‘I didn&#8217;t leave anything which I thought that you would wish to say except that I said it to him.’ They said, ‘Did he respond to you?’ He said, ‘No, by the one who caused the <em>Ka’bah</em> to be built, I did not understand anything which he said except that he warned you of a terrible punishment like that of ’Aad and Thamood.’ They said, ‘Woe to you, the man speaks to you in Arabic and you don&#8217;t understand what he says?!’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, I did not understand anything that he said except for his mention of the terrible punishment.’”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this war was fought with words and the soul, with biting attacks and belittlement and derision, by overcoming the falsehood and ignorance of the <em>Mushriks. </em>At the same time, establishing the proof against them so that whoever went to destruction did so aware of the clear proof, and those who lived did so upon the clear proof. So from the results of this war, and from the results of this clear declaration was that Allaah guided many of the Arabs from the Quraysh and from the other tribes, and from <em>Aws</em> and the <em>Khazraj</em>. Allaah granted them clear discernment and they realised the reality of <em>tawheed</em> and its status. They also knew the vileness of committing <em>shirk</em> with idols or anything else, and also, at the same time, its seriousness and evil consequences for the <em>Mushriks</em> in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these were the great and good fruits which came as a result of the <em>Jihaad</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions and their steadfastness in the field of true <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah, and their intensive striving against the idols and false objects of worship. Then when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  took <em>tawheed</em> to a new practical level which was to physically annihilate, smash and eradicate the idols and purify the earth from them, being fully aware of their seriousness, since they are the primary source of danger for every generation of mankind since the dawn of history until the end of history, just as the leader of those upon the true and straight religion said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ ۖ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي ۖ وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols, O my Lord, they have indeed caused the misguidance of many people.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  [Soorah Ibraaheem (14):35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the greatest Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  resolved to carry out the task of purifying the earth from idols, and to level the graves since tombs are the partner of the idols in causing the misguidance of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  entered Makkah and there were three hundred and sixty idols erected around the <em>Ka’bah</em>. So he began striking them with a stick which he had in his hand and was saying, ‘<em>The truth has arrived and falsehood has perished. The truth has arrived and falsehood cannot begin or return</em>.’”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prepared an attachment to go from al-Madeenah to the tribe of Khath’am to attack Dhul-Khalasah, which they did. From Jareer ibn ’Abdullaah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “There was a house<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> called Dhul-Khalasah, or the <em>Yemeni Ka’bah</em> or the <em>Shaamee Ka’bah</em>, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to me, <em>‘Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khulasah?’</em> So I set out with a hundred and fifty riders of the Ahmas tribe. So we broke it down and killed whomever we found there. Then I came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and informed him, so he made supplication for blessing for us and for the tribe of Ahmas.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording used by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ahmad is, <em>“Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khalasah?”</em> See the wording used by the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ?! It was as if the existence of idols deprived him of sleep and disturbed him, so that he could not settle or be at ease.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> <em>Al-Laat</em> had its origin in a man of the tribe of <em>Thaqeef</em> who used to mix gruel for pilgrims in the times of ignorance near to a certain rock in <em>Taa’if</em>. Then after his death the people built a tomb around the rock, upon his grave. They then worshipped this and gave it the name <em>al-Laat</em> which they invented by twisting the name of Allaah. Allaah’s Messenger (*) sent al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah and Aboo Sufyaan to destroy it. They did so and in its place the mosque of Taa’if was built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>, then it was in the form of a tree surrounded by a curtained building in a palm grove between Taa’if and Makkah. The Quraysh used to venerate it. An-Nasaa’ee reports in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/357 no.567) that when Allaah’s Messenger (*) conquered Makkah he sent Khaalid ibn al-Waleed to it. He found that it was built around three trees, so he cut them down and destroyed the building. He then went to the Prophet (*) and informed him, but he said, “Return for you have done nothing.” So he returned and saw the keepers of the idol fleeing into the hills saying, “O <em>&#8216;Uzzaa</em>!” So Khaalid came and found a naked female with dishevelled hair, throwing dust upon her head. So he struck her with his sword and killed her, then he returned to the Prophet (*) and informed him. So he said, “That was <em>al-’Uzzaa.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Manaat</em> then it was situated at <em>Mushallal,</em> near to Qudayd, between Makkah and al-Madeenah. It was venerated by various tribes in the times of ignorance. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (*) sent ’Alee to demolish it in the year of the Conquest of Makkah. Ibn Ishaaq said in his <em>Seerah</em>, “The Arabs took other structures besides the <em>Ka’bah</em>, buildings which they worshipped and venerated just as they honoured the <em>Ka’bah</em>. These shrines had keepers and guards, and offerings would be made to them just as with the <em>Ka’bah</em>. The people would also make <em>tawaaf</em> around them and make sacrifices there&#8230;” (<em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> and <em>Tayseerul-’Azeezil-Hameed</em>, (p.177)).</p>

Ibn Katheer said in his <em>Tafseer</em> (7/151), after quoting the <em>hadeeth</em> with his chain of narration from ’Abd ibn Humayd and Aboo Ya’laa: “Al-Baghawee reports it in his <em>Tafseer</em> with his chain of narration from Muhammad ibn Fudayl: from al-Ajlah, who is Ibn ’Abdullaah al-Kindee, and he is declared somewhat weak from adh-Dhayyaal&#8230;” However al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) says about him in <em>at-Taqreeb</em> (1/46), “Generally acceptable <em>Shee’ee</em> from the seventh level.” Adh-Dhahabee said in <em>al-Kaashif</em> (1/99), “He was declared reliable by Ibn Ma’een and others and declared weak by an-Nasaa’ee and was a <em>Shee&#8217;ee</em>.” As for his Shaykh, adh-Dhayyaal, then al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) says of him in <em>Ta’jeelul-Manfa’ah</em> (p.84), “He reports from Jaabir and Ibn ’Umar and al-Qaasim ibn Mukhaymirah. Fitr ibn Khaleefah, Husayyin, al-Ajlah and Hajjaaj ibn Arlhat narrate from him. And Ibn Hibbaan declared him reliable.” The rest of the narrators of the chain are reliable.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Dawah</em> of Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noblest of all the Prophets and the last of them, Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). The one sent with the greatest, most complete and most comprehensive message. The one whom Allaah sent as a mercy for the worlds, and as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and as a Caller to Allaah with His permission, and a shining light. He did not leave anything good except that he guided his <em>ummah</em> to it and pointed it out to them, nor anything evil except that he warned them against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So which of the fundamentals of Islaam did this exalted Prophet begin with? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What was the starting point for his <em>da’wah</em>? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with what all the Prophets began with, and started where they started in their <em>da’wah</em>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>calling to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and calling for all worship to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone</strong></span>. He began with the testification, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah,” (<em>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah</em>). Can it be imagined that he or any of the other Prophets would begin with anything but this great principle, the foundation of all the divine Messages?! Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with this fundamental principle, so the first thing which the people heard was, &#8216;Witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.&#8217; So the proud and haughty said.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ  &#8211; وَانطَلَقَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا وَاصْبِرُوا عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The unbelievers said, ‘Has he made all that is to be worshipped a single God, who alone is to be called upon and hears all invocations. This is a very curious thing which we have not heard of.’ So the leaders amongst them went off saying to one another, ‘Continue in what you are upon and persist in worshipping your idols. He only says this to gain ascendancy over us.’”  </strong></span>[Soorah Saad (38):5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued calling to this lofty principle and highest goal throughout the Meccan period of his Messengership, for thirteen years. He did not become weary or languid. He patiently bore all types of harm to propagate this principle, since no religious duties or pillars of Islaam were obligated upon him, except for the Prayer which was obligated in the tenth year of Prophethood, and apart from the excellent manners of keeping ties of relationship, truthfulness and chastity which he commanded his people with. However the core of his <em>da’wah</em> and the cause of dispute and opposition to him was that great fundamental principle. So Allaah charged this noble Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the particular duty of establishing this great principle. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed We have sent down the Book to you, O Muhammad, with the truth, so worship Allaah alone making all religion purely and sincerely for Him. Indeed the religion that is free of all taint of <em>shirk</em> is alone what is acceptable to Allaah. As for those who take and invoke helpers and protectors besides Allaah, then they say, ‘We only worship them so that they should intercede for us and bring us nearer to Allaah.’ Indeed Allaah will establish judgement between them regarding the matters of religion about which they dispute.”</span>  [</strong>Soorah az-Zumar (39):2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ &#8211;  قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; قُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ دِينِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Allaah has commanded that I should worship Him alone, purely and sincerely, not associating anything with Him, and I am commanded to be the first of this nation who submits to Him as a Muslim, making all worship purely for Him.’ Say, O Muhammad, ‘I fear should I disobey my Lord in this, the torment of a great Day.’ Say, ‘It is Allaah alone that I worship, making all of my worship purely and sincerely for Him, and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</span></strong>[Soorah az-Zumar (39):11-14]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share of any of that for other than Him. That is what My Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also commanded him to call all of the people to fulfil and implement this principle, and to proceed upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ &#8211; الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O Mankind, single out your Lord with worship; He who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be of those who seek to avoid Allaah’s punishment and anger; those whom Allaah is pleased with. He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah in your worship whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The God Who alone has the right to be worshipped is a Single God. So do not worship anything besides Him, nor associate anything in worship with Him, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)<strong>, to all of the people, ‘I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all. Allaah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. None has the right to be worshipped but Him. He Who alone gives life and death. So affirm true faith in Allaah and in His sole right to worship, and believe in His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet </strong>(Muhammad صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him, so that you may be rightly guided.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat </em>in this regard are very many, and what we have quoted is an example showing the methodology of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   in calling to <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the<em> Sunnah</em>, there are many things clearly showing that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began his <em>da’wah</em> with <em>tawheed</em> and completed it with it, and continued calling to it from the beginning to the end, throughout his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ’Amr ibn ’Abasah as-Sulamee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“During the times of Ignorance I used hold that the people were upon error and futility, and they used to worship the idols, then I heard of a man in Makkah who received revelation. So I set out upon my riding beast and came to him. At that time he was in hiding due to oppression of his people. So I behaved in a way that enabled me to gain access to him in Makkah, which I did. So I said to him, ‘What are you?’ He replied, ‘I am a Prophet.’ So I said, ‘And what is a Prophet?’ He said, ‘Allaah has sent me as a Messenger.’ So I said, ‘And what is it that He has sent you with?’ He said, ‘I have been sent to order the joining of ties of relationship, to break the idols, so that Allaah is worshipped alone and nothing at all is associated in worship along with Him.’ So I said, ‘And who is with you upon this?’ He said, ‘A free man and a slave.’ He said, ‘And at that time Aboo Bakr and Bilaal were with him from those who believed in him&#8230;’“ </em></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/395 no.1812) and Ahmad in <em>al-Musand</em> (4/112)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) When ’Amr ibn al-’Aas and ’Abdullaah ibn Rabee’ah al-Makhzoomee went to an-Najaashee, the ruler of Abyssinia, to speak to him in order to incite him against the Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia, they said, ‘O king, some of our foolish youths have abandoned their religion and come to your land. They have split away from their own people and have not entered your religion. Rather they have come up with an innovated religion which is not known either to us or to you&#8230;’ So the Najaashee asked the Muslims, ‘What is this religion which you have split from your people and not entered my religion or the religion of any of these nations?!’ So Ja’far ibn Abee Taalib was the one who replied, and he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O king, we were a people from the people of ignorance who worshipped idols, and we ate unslaughtered meat and committed foul acts, and we cut off ties of relationship, treated our neighbours in an evil manner and the strong amongst us used to devour the weak. So we were upon that until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage, his truthfulness, his trustworthiness and his chastity. <strong>So he called us to Allaah, that we should single Him out and worship Him alone and renounce everything which we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, all stones and idols</strong>; he commanded us to speak the truth and to fulfil trusts; to join ties of relationship; to live in a good manner with our neighbours; to avoid forbidden acts and shedding blood; and he forbade us from foul acts and from falsehood; and he forbade us from unlawfully devouring the wealth of orphans and falsely accusing chaste women. <strong>He ordered us to worship Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him&#8230;</strong>’ He said, ‘So he told him the affairs of Islaam,’ &#8216;So we attested to his truthfulness and believed him and followed him in that which he came with. So we worshipped Allaah alone, and did not worship anything else besides Him, and we made forbidden that which He forbade us, and declared lawful that which He allowed for us. So our people became enemies to us and tortured us and tormented us to turn back from our religion to the worship of idols, and so that we should allow the filthy actions which we used to allow. So when they oppressed us, treated us cruelly and made it unbearable for us, and came between us and our religion, then we left and came to your land, and we preferred you to others and wished to live in your company, and we hoped that we would not be oppressed while with you&#8230;’” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Also amongst the questions which Hirqal (Heraclius) asked Aboo Sufyaan, at the time of the peace of Hudaybiyyah, about Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was that he asked Aboo Sufyaan, “What does he command you?” So Aboo Sufyaan replied, “He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else along with Him, and abandon what your fathers say. And he orders Prayer, charity, chastity and the joining of ties of relationship.</strong>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 1/7/no. 6) and it is a long <em>hadeeth]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ahaadeeth</em> clearly show us what the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  was in both the Makkan and Madinan periods.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> (1/202) and (5/290). Ahmad said, “Ya’qoob (meaning Ibraaheem ibn Sa&#8217;d az-Zuhree) narrated to us (reliable): My father narrated to us, from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq: Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn ’Ubaydillaah ibn Shihaab narrated to me: from Aboo Bakr ibn ’Abdir-Rahmaan ibn al-Haarith ibn Hishaam al-Makhzoomee:from Umm Salamah bint Abee Umayyah (meaning the Mother of the Believers, <em>radiyallaahu ’anha</em>).” It is a chain of narration that is fully <em>saheeh</em>, except for Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, but he clearly states that he heard it directly and so his narration is <em>hasan</em> (good and acceptable).</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عن أبي واقد الليثي، قال: خرجنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى حنين ونحن حدثاء عهد بكفر، وللمشركين سدرة يعكفون عندها وينوطون بها أسلحتهم، يقال لها: ذات أنواط، فمررنا بسدرة فقلنا: يا رسول الله أجعل لنا ذات أنواط كما لهم ذات أنواط فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (الله أكبر! إنها السنن، قلتم ـ والذي نفسي بيده ـ كما قالت بنو إسرائيل لموسى: (<span style="color:#008000;">اجعل لنا إلهاً كما لهم آلهة قال إنكم قوم تجهلون</span>)  (لتركبن سنن من كان قبلكم</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(رواه الترمذي وصححه )</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abū Wāqid al-Laythī said: &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger to Ḥunayn while we had just recently left disbelief. The mushrikīn had a lote tree which they used to frequent and hang their swords upon. They called it <em>thāt al-anwāt </em></strong>(possessor of the medals of honor)<strong>. Afterward, we passed by </strong>(another)<strong> lote tree, so we said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;O Messenger of Allah, make a <em>thāt al-anwāt</em> for us like their <em>thāt al-anwāt</em>.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«Allahu Akbar! This way that you have mentioned, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, is just like what the children of Isrā&#8217;īl asked Mūsā:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mūsā! Make for us an ilahān (a god) as they have āliha (gods). He said: &#8216;Verily, you are a people who are behaving ignorantly</strong></span>.&#8217;» [Sūrah al-A&#8217;rāf (7):138]</p>
<p><strong>You will follow the way of those before you.»</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by at-Tirmithī no. 2181 and he graded it ḥasan ṣaḥīḥ. It is also recorded by others. Shaykh Al-Albānī graded it ṣaḥīḥ in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Jāmī&#8217; no. 3601.]</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Kitāb-ut-Tawheed : Chapter 2:</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: (قال موسى: يا رب، علمني شيئاً أذكرك وأدعوك به. قال: يا موسى: قل لا إله إلا الله. قال: يا رب كل عبادك يقولون هذا. قال: يا موسى، لو أن السموات السبع وعامرهن غيري، والأرضين السبع في كفة، ولا إله الله في كفة، مالت بهن لا إله الله) [رواه ابن حبان، والحاكم وصححه].</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Musa (Moses) (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said: &#8216;O my Rabb, teach me something through which I can remember You and supplicate to You.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah answered: &#8216;Say, O Musa, <em>La ilaha ilIa-Allah</em>&#8216;. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Musa said: &#8216;O my Rabb, all your slaves say these words&#8217;. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah said: &#8216;O Musa, if the seven heavens and all they contain other than Me </strong></span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> (Ghairy) and the seven earths as well, were all put in one side of a scale and <em>La ilaha ilIa-Allah</em> put in the other the latter would overweigh them.'&#8221;  </strong>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">02</span>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This Hadith has been reported by Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim declared it Sahih].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <span style="color:#999999;">This phrase (Ghairy) is the exception from what is in the heavens. It should not be misunderstood that Allah is contained within the heavens or earth since He has described Himself in the Qur&#8217;an as the Transcendent, Most High, Above All, i.e. in 2:255, 20:5, 25:59 and many places elsewhere in His Book. Indeed the statement is another proof that Allah cannot be considered within the creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translation and Footnotes [01] are taken from: Darusalam english publication]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">02</span>] This ḥadīth was recorded by Ibn Ḥib-bān, al-Ḥākim, an-Nasā&#8217;ī in al-Yawm wal-Laylah, aṭ-Ṭabarānī in ad-Du&#8217;ā and al-Bayhaqī in al-Asmā&#8217; waṣ-Ṣifāt. Al-Ḥākim graded it ṣaḥīḥ and ath-Thahabī was silent about it, usually indicating his approval. Similarly Ibn Ḥajar graded it ṣaḥīḥ in Fat.ḥ al-Bārī 11:208, it has a slightly different chain of narrators with aṭ-Ṭabarānī and Abū Ya&#8217;la about which al-Haythamī said (al-Majma&#8217;): &#8220;It is recorded by Abū Ya&#8217;la and its men are trustworthy, but among them there is some weakness.&#8221; Commenting on the chain of Ibn Ḥib-bān, &#8216;Alūsh (Tashnif al-Athān no. 927) says: &#8220;Its chain is weak, Darāj Abū Sumah is weak in his reports from Abū al-Haytham.&#8221; Ibn al-Munthir listed Darāj Abū Sumah among the narrators who the ḥadīth scholars differ over saying, &#8220;Abū Ḥātim declared him weak, as did ad-Dāraqutnī and others, Aḥmad said, &#8220;His ḥadīths are rejected,&#8221; an-Nasā&#8217;ī said, &#8220;Rejected.&#8221; Yet others considered him trustworthy like Yahyā b. Ma&#8217;īn (it seems that quotes from him are what al-Ḥākim depended upon according to al-Munthirī&#8217;s comments in at-Targhīb) and particularly at-Tirmithī in case he reports from Abū al-Haytham (as in this case)! Likewise he was quoted for support by Ibn Khuzaymah. Al-Albānī calls him the possessor and author of munākir (rejected ḥadīths) see al-Dā&#8217;īfah 1:294 and 254. Al-Albānī graded it weak in Da&#8217;īf al-Mawārid al-Zamān no. 295 , as did Muqbil b. Hādī in al-Mustadrak no. 1988.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is however a more agreed upon authentic ḥadīth with different wording that gives much of the desired meaning for the context of this point. &#8216;Abdullāh b. &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;Ās narrated that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: «When death visited Allah&#8217;s Prophet Nūh (<em>alaihissalam</em>), he said to his son: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;I shall narrate to you the will. I command you with two things and I forbid you from two things: I command with <em>Lā ilāha illa Allāh</em>. Surely if the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed on a pan of a scale, and <em>Lā ilāha illa Allāh</em> was placed on the other pan of the scale, they would give in to <em>Lā ilāha illa Allāh</em>&#8230;</strong></span>» This ḥadīth was recorded by al-Bukhaaree in al-Adab al-Mufrad, Aḥmad, al-Bayhaqī in al-Asmā&#8217;, and also aṭ-Ṭabarānī according to al-Haythamī who said, &#8220;This isnād is ṣaḥīḥ.&#8221; Al-Albānī included it in aṣ-Ṣahīhah no. 134, and Shaykh Muqbil b. Hādī included Aḥmad&#8217;s ḥadīth in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Musnad minma Laysa fī aṣ-Ṣaḥīḥayn v. 1 p.544 and he said, &#8220;This ḥadīth is ṣaḥīḥ.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Types of <em>Taaghoot</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والطواغيتُ كثيرونَ ورؤوسُهُمْ خمَسةٌ: إبليسُ لعنَهُ اللهُ، ومَنْ عُبِدَ وهو راض<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The <em>taaghoots</em> are many, and their heads are five:  Iblees &#8211; may Allaah’s curse be upon him. Whoever is worshipped and is pleased with that</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>79</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">79</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “<strong>And the <em>taaghoots</em> are many and the heads of them are five</strong>.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>taaghoots</em> upon whom this definition applies are: everyone who is worshipped or followed or obeyed, and they are many but their heads are five – meaning their major ones are five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly, Iblees</strong></span>, may Allaah’s curse be upon him &#8211; meaning: may Allaah expel him and distance him away from His Mercy on account of the fact that he refused to prostrate to Aadam and he disobeyed Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and he was proud and haughty. And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ ۖ خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And he </strong>(Iblees)<strong> said:</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I am better than him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Aadam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, You created me from fire and You created him from clay.</span></strong>[38:76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he disobeyed the command of Allaah and was haughty; therefore Allaah cursed him and He repelled him and distanced him. And he is called <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Iblees</strong></span>, it is said, because he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>ablasa</em> </strong></span>(despaired) of Mercy – meaning he despaired of Mercy. So the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>mublis</em> </strong></span>is one who despairs of something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Iblees, may Allaah’s curse be upon him, is the head of the <em>taaghoots</em> because he is the one who commands with worship of other than Allaah and he is the one who commands with following other than the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> and he is the one who commands obedience to other than Allaah by declaring things to be permissible or forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Iblees is the source of evil and he is the head of the <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second category (of <em>taaghoots</em>) is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The one who is worshipped and he is pleased with that – meaning he is worshipped and he is pleased with the people’s worship of him. So he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who is worshipped and he is not pleased with that then he does not enter into that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For ‘Eesaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> has been worshipped besides Allaah but he was not pleased with that. And his mother and ‘Uzayr and the <em>awliyaa</em> (beloved servants of Allaah) and the righteous people from the servants of Allaah, they are not pleased with that (worship of them). Rather they used to criticize this and fight against those who did it. So whoever is worshipped and he is not pleased with that, then he is not called a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is because when Allaah sent down His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You </strong>(people of shirk)<strong> and whatever idols you worship will be fuel for the Hellfire. You will enter it.</strong></span> [21:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the people of shirk became happy and they said, “We worship the Messiah (‘Eesaa) and we worship such and such and we worship such and such. Therefore they will be with us in the Fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Most High, sent down:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُم مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَىٰ أُولَٰئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَا يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا ۖ وَهُمْ فِي مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَالِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those for whom Allaah has written that they shall be people of bliss, they shall be kept far away from it. They shall not hear even the slightest sound from it </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Fire)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but rather they shall be enjoying whatever their souls desire forever</span>. </strong>[21:101-102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other aayah that they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they say: are our gods better or is he?</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: ‘Eesaa <em>‘alaihissalaam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ ۚ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلَّا جَدَلًا ۚ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ مَثَلًا لِّبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>They do not quote him as an example to you except in order to argue. Indeed they are an argumentative people; he was no more than a slave upon whom We bestowed favor and We made him an example for the Banoo Israa.eel.</b></span></span> [43:58-59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is a slave of Allaah and he was not pleased that he should be worshipped besides Allaah. Indeed Allaah sent him to criticize that:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(‘Eesaa will say on the Day of Resurrection)<strong>, “I did not say to them except what You commanded me to – that you should worship Allaah alone, my Lord and your Lord. </strong></span>[5:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore one who is worshipped and he is not pleased with that – he does not enter under this threat and he is not a <em>taaghoot</em> because he rejects and criticises that. This is because at <em>taaghoot</em> is one who is pleased with worship besides Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنْ دعا الناسَ إلى عبادَةِ نفسِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> Whoever calls the people to the worship of himself</strong></span><strong>.</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>80</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[80]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: “<strong>Whoever calls the people to the worship of himself</strong>”:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as the heads of the people of shirk, those who call the people to worship them, such as Fir’awn who said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So he </strong>(Fir’awn)<strong> said, “I am your highest Lord.” </strong></span>[79:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as Namrood and such as the extreme Soofees, those who call the people to worship them, to such an extent that they give instructions to the people to worship them after they have died, so that one of them says, “<em>When matters become very difficult for you then come to my grave</em>” – meaning: “<em>when affairs become difficult  for you, then you should come to my grave  and a few handfuls of earth cannot prevent you from me</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they counsel the people to come to their (the leaders’) graves and they promise them that they (the leaders) will carry out their needs. So whoever calls the people to worship of himself, whether whilst he is alive or dead, then he is from the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise whoever calls the people to worship someone else besides him from the <em>taaghoots</em> and they are the callers to shirk, they are <em>taaghoots</em>, those who falsely beautify shirk for the people and they call it with other than its name, and they say, “<em>This is a case of tawassul (seeking legitimate means to Allaah) or a case of shafaa’ah (legitimate intercession)</em>.” And they are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those are <em>taaghoots</em> because they call the people to shirk, so they call to the worship of other than Allaah and they call that (shirk) with other than its name and they falsely adorn it for the people with doubts and falsely adorned speech. They are <em>taaghoots</em>. The callers to shirk are <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And everyone who is worshipped besides Allaah and is pleased with that or calls the people to the worship of himself or calls the people to worship of other than Allaah then he is from the <em>taaghoots</em>; indeed he is from the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em> – we ask Allaah for safety and salvation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنِ ادَّعى شيئًا مِنْ عِلمِ الغيْبِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the hidden and unseen (<em>al-Ghayb</em>)</span></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>81</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">81</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one is “<strong>whoever claims to possess anything from knowledge of the hidden and unseen</strong>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And entering into this are the sorcerers and the astrologers and the fortunetellers and the geomancers, and everyone who claims that he possesses knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> and says to the people, “Such and such will occur for you. For you, you will receive bliss or you will receive some hardship or you will have a successful marriage or you will have an unsuccessful one. Those people claim knowledge of the hidden and the unseen. And the hidden and unseen is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: No one in the Heavens or the Earth knows the <em>ghayb</em> except Allaah. </strong></span>[27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا  &#8211; إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) is the Knower of the <em>ghayb</em>. He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to one whom He is pleased with whom He has sent as a Messenger</span>.</strong> [72:26-27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۚ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتِ الْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And with Allaah are the keys to the <em>ghayb</em>; no one knows it except Him. And He knows whatever is in the land and in the ocean; and no leaf falls except that He knows of it. Nor is there any grain in the darkness of the Earth nor any fresh thing nor any dry thing except that it is written in a Clear Book. </strong></span>[6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>no one knows it except Him…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a limitation. So no one knows the <em>ghayb</em> except for Allaah or one from His Messengers to whom Allaah has revealed something from the ghayb for the benefit of Mankind and as miracle for the messenger. However he will not know the <em>ghayb</em> from himself. Rather he only knows from Allaah’s teaching it to him. So no one knows the ghayb except for Allaah. So whoever claims to have knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> then he would be a sharer with Allaah with regards to something particular to Him, He the Perfect. Therefore, that person is a <em>mushrik</em> (person of <em>shirk</em>), he is a <em>taaghoot</em>, and he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). And this is one of the greatest forms of apostasy from Islaam.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنْ حكمَ بغيِر مَا أنزلَ الله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <span style="color:#993300;">And whoever judges by other than what Allaah sent down</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>82</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">82</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one is whoever judges by other than that which Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to refer for judgment to the <em>taaghoot</em>. </strong></span>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever judges by other than that which Allaah sent down holding that to be permissible to do, then he will be a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who says, “It is permissible to refer for judgment to man-made laws or to the customs of the times of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em> or to the customs of the tribes of the Bedouins and to leave behind the Legislation,” – he says, “This is lawful to do,” or he says, “This is equal to that which Allaah sent down.” And if he says, “It is better than that which Allaah sent down or equal to that which Allaah sent down,” or he says, “It is just permissible to do,” and he doesn’t even say, “It is equal or better,” – he just says, “It is permissible and allowed to do this”, then this person is a <em>taaghoot</em>. And this is by the text of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to refer for judgment to the <em>taaghoot</em>. </strong></span>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was called a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has gone beyond his limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for a person who judges by other than that which Allaah has sent down whilst he affirms that that which Allaah sent down is what is obligatory to follow and is the Truth and that anything else is false and futile and that he is judging with something futile &#8211; then this person is counted as being a <em>kaafir</em> who has committed <em>al-kufr-ul-asghar</em> (lesser <em>kufr</em>) which does not take a person out of the religion. However he is upon great danger, he is upon a way which may lead to <em>kufr</em> which takes a person out of the religion if he becomes lax about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who judges by other than that which Allaah sent down, without intending to do so, rather (he does so) from <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal striving and deduction) and he is a person who is rightful to be performing <em>ijtihaad</em> from the people of <em>fiqh</em>, and he performs <em>ijtihaad</em> but he does not actually attain the judgment of Allaah and he makes a mistake in his <em>ijtihaad</em>, then this is forgiven for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When the judge judges and strives and he reaches the correct conclusion, then he will receive two rewards. And when he judges and strives and reaches the incorrect conclusion, then for him there is one reward.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (7352) and Muslim (1716 )from the hadeeth of ‘Amr ibn al ‘Aas <em>radiy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because he did not deliberately commit a mistake. He was intending the Truth; he was intending conformity with the judgment of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. However, he was not granted the success of attaining it. So this person is counted as being excused and one who will receive reward. But it is not permissible to follow him upon the error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this are the matters of <em>ijtihaad</em> of the jurists who have made a mistake in those matters or the striving of the judges in the courts when they strive to arrive at a ruling and they exert effort to reach the Truth. However they are not granted it. So their error is forgiven.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rejecting <em>at-Taaghoot</em>, and Having <em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وافترضَ اللهُ على جميعِ العبادِ الكفرَ بالطاغوتِ والإيمانَ بالله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made it obligatory upon all of the servants to reject <em>at-taaghoot</em>, and to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah</strong></span>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>77</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">77</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaykh <em>rahimahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And Allaah has made it obligatory upon all of the servants to reject <em>at-taaghoot</em>, and to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah…</strong>” Then he mentioned the definition of <em>at-taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>taaghoot</em> has been mentioned by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, in many <em>aayaat</em>. From them is His saying, He the Most High, in Soorat-ul-Baqarah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمُ الطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَاتِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-taaghoot </em></strong>(everything which is worshipped besides Allaah)<strong> and believes truly in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will not break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Guardian Lord of those who truly believe; He brings them out from darkness into light.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who disbelieve, then their supporters are <em>at-taaghoot</em>; they take them out from the light into darkness. They are the inhabitants of the Fire; they will remain in it forever. </strong></span>[2:256-257]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorat-un-Nisaa His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِّنَ الْكِتَابِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْجِبْتِ وَالطَّاغُوتِ وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا هَٰؤُلَاءِ أَهْدَىٰ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will you not consider those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in <em>al</em> <em>jibt </em></strong>(the idols, soothsayers and sorcery)<strong> and in <em>at-taaghoot</em>. And they say to those who disbelieve that they are closer to the Truth than the believers. </strong></span>[4:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>aayah</em> is with regard to the Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect, said with regards to the hypocrites:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوا أَن يَكْفُرُوا بِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will you not consider those who claim that they believe in that which came down to you and in that which came down before you, wishing to refer for judgment to at taaghoot? And they were commanded to reject it.</span> </strong>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorat-un-Nahl that He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We sent a Messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and keep away from at taaghoot.”</span> </strong>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-taaghoot</em> is derived from at <em>tughyaan</em> and it is to exceed the due limit. So it is said in the (‘Arabic) language, ‘the water has <em>taghaa’</em> when the water raises above its level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى الْمَاءُ حَمَلْنَاكُمْ فِي الْجَارِيَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the water <em>taghaa</em> </strong>(went beyond its limits)<strong> then We carried you in the Ark. </strong></span>[69:11]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال ابنُ القيِّمِ رحمهُ اللهُ تعالى: معنى الطاغوت ما تجاوزَ بِهِ العبدُ حدَّهُ مِنْ معبودٍ، أو متبوعٍ، أو مطاع<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibn ul Qayyim, <em>rahimahullaah ta’aala</em>, said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The meaning of <em>At-taaghoot</em> is anyone regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone <span style="text-decoration:underline;">worshipped</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">followed</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">obeyed</span>.”</strong></span> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>78</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">78</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of <em>at-taaghoot</em> in the Legislation, then it is just as ibn ul Qayyim <em>rahimahullaah</em> mentioned, and the author quoted him here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-taaghoot</em> – whoever the servant goes beyond the due limits regarding. The servant has a due limit because he is a servant; Allaah has given him bounds which it is obligatory that he should stop at. So if he goes beyond them, then he will be a <em>taaghoot</em>. So whoever goes beyond the limits set by Allaah for His servants and which He has commanded them not to exceed and not to come close to, then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>. So if he disobeys Allaah and goes beyond His limits and goes beyond the bounds, then he is called a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has gone beyond the limits and exceeded the limits laid down by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#993300;">(<strong><em>At-Taaghoot</em></strong>) is anyone regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped or followed or obeyed</span>”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the comprehensive definition for the <em>taaghoot</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded that He alone be worshipped and that no partner be set up with Him. And He commanded that His Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> should be followed and He commanded that He should be obeyed and that His Messenger should be obeyed with regard to that which He declared lawful and that which He declared forbidden. So whoever goes beyond this matter then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever exceeds the limit of worship which Allaah has made obligatory and which is particular to Him and which He has negated for anyone else besides Him, then (this person) worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mushrik</em> (person of shirk) is a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has exceeded the limit with regards to worship, and has worshipped someone else along with Allaah. He has directed worship to other than the One who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the one who is worshipped and is pleased with that (is a <em>taaghoot</em>). The person who is worshipped by the people and he is pleased with that and he establishes himself as a chief and as a leader upon that basis – such as Fir’awn (the Pharaoh) and an-Namrood and the shaykhs of the extreme Soofee paths, those who are worshipped by their followers and they are pleased with that, or who call the people to that, i.e. to worship them, as will follow – then this a <em>taaghoot</em> with regards to worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#993300;">or followed”</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded the whole of creation that they should follow Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So it is not permissible for anyone to follow anyone else besides him <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em>. So whoever follows other than the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> and claims that this is permissible, then he (this person) will be a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has followed someone other than the Messenger <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, the one whom he was commanded to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So following is specific to the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. As for other than him from the scholars and the callers then they are followed when they follow the way of the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So the one who is followed in truth is the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those (other people) then they are just conveying the message, they are followed for the truth and upon whatever they conform to with regard to the following of the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. And wherever they are contrary to what the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>was upon, then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of that is the shaykhs of the Soofee paths; their followers and their worshippers follow them upon other than obedience to the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they say, “<em>We have no need for the Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) because we take from where the Messenger (sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) took from and we take knowledge directly from Allaah. The Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) took from Allaah through an intermediary, via Jibreel whereas we take directly from Allaah.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say, “<em>You people narrate your religion from those who have died whereas we narrate our religion from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High</em>” because they claim that their shaykhs have a connection with Allaah and that they take knowledge from Allaah directly. They have reached this level of transgression – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – this is their way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that those people are the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em> – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because there is no way to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, except through following His Messenger <em>sallallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ ۖ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>, “If you truly love Allaah, then follow me, then Allaah will love you and will forgive you your sins. And Allaah forgives extensively and bestows mercy.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “Obey Allaah and the Messenger.” So if they turn away then Allaah does not love the disbelievers.</strong></span> [3:31-32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who follows other than the Messenger, this person is counted as a <em>taaghoot</em>. And likewise the person who calls people to follow him and says to the people, “<em>I will bring you orders directly from Allaah</em>” – this is the greatest one of the <em>taaghoots</em> in existence in the world. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>one who is obeyed…</strong></span>”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Obedience is to be for Allaah and for His Messenger regarding what he declares to be lawful and what he declares to be forbidden. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ ۖ فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from amongst you. And if you dispute about anything, then refer it back to Allaah and to the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. </strong><strong>That is what is best for you and is what is best in its consequences.</strong></span> [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is lawful is that which Allaah has made lawful; and that which is forbidden is that which Allaah has made forbidden. And it is not for anyone to share with Allaah in making things lawful or forbidden. And therefore Allaah passed the ruling upon those who declare things lawful or declare things forbidden or obeys one who does that – that such a person is a <em>mushrik</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُم بِآيَاتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُم مَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ ۗ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا لَّيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُعْتَدِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَذَرُوا ظَاهِرَ الْإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ الْإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُوا يَقْتَرِفُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ ۗ وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Eat from that which Allaah’s Name has been mentioned upon, if you truly believe in His Signs. And why would you not eat from that which Allaah’s Name been mentioned upon when He has made clear to you whatever has been made forbidden for you – except for that which you have a dire need of.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And there are many who misguide with their desires without knowledge. Indeed your Lord knows best those who exceed the limits.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And leave off outward and inward sins. Those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they earned.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And do not eat from that which Allaah’s Name is not mentioned upon, and it is sin.</strong><strong>And the devils inspire their followers to dispute with you. And were you to obey them, then you would be people of shirk. </strong></span>[6:118-121]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the people of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em> said, “<em>Dead meat is lawful because Allaah, He is the One who slaughtered it. So it has more right to be lawful than that which you people sacrifice and slaughter</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says (in these <em>aayaat</em> from Soorah al An’aam) (for us) do not eat except for that which has been slaughtered in the legislated manner and He made forbidden for you dead meat. Whereas those people say, “No, dead meat is permissible; it has more right to be lawful than that which has been slaughtered because it is you people who have slaughtered it whereas an animal which has died, then Allaah is the One who has slaughtered it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore He refuted the people of <em>shirk</em> and He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not eat from that which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned upon. And it is sin…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: it is to exit from obedience to Allaah, the Perfect, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said after it:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the devils inspire their allies&#8230;</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say, “<em>Dead meat, it was slaughtered by Allaah whereas the animals that you people slaughter, you have slaughtered them. So how can you hold it as lawful that which you people sacrifice and you do not regard as lawful that which Allaah has sacrificed?!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a false and futile argument.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you were to obey them, then you would be people of <em>shirk</em>.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because this is <em>shirk</em> with regards to obedience. Declaring something lawful and declaring something forbidden is the right of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for anyone to declare lawful or to declare forbidden from his own self, or to obey someone in declaring something lawful or something forbidden from his own self. And whoever does that then he is a <em>taaghoot</em> and he is obeying the <em>taaghoots</em>, those who declare things lawful and declare things forbidden besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of his saying: “Or one who is obeyed…” Meaning: obeyed in declaring things lawful and forbidden because declaring things lawful and declaring things forbidden is the right of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High; and the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was one who conveyed from Allaah that which He made lawful and that which He made forbidden.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Time Period of the Call in Makkah</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخذ على هذا عشر سنين يدعو إلى التوحيد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>. <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» meaning: He called the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and warned against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> for ten years in Makkah. He was calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because they used to direct worship to the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wisdom in Allaah&#8217;s sending him as a prophet in Makkah was that Makkah is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> (the mother of all the cities), that to which all the cities relate back to. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يَبْعَثَ فِي أُمِّهَا رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord would not destroy the townships until He sent a Messenger in their original one</strong></span>.» [28:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;<em>Umm</em>&#8216; is the source to which something relates back to and the foundation which it relates back to; this is the <em>Umm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the foundation of the Book</strong>.</span>» [3:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The source to which the <em>aayaat</em> which are <em>muta<u>sh</u>aabihah</em> (unclear) are referred back to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Makkah has been honored by Allaah, in that it is the original place to which the whole of the people of the Earth resort back, and Muslims in the different regions of the Earth return to Makkah. So it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> with the meaning that it is the place of return. Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in Makkah because it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in it for thirteen years forbidding the people of Makkah from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and commanding them with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, because the people of Makkah are the example for others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is binding that Makkah should remain, until the establishment of the Hour, as an abode of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and a beacon for the call to Allaah, and everything which conflicts with that must be kept away from it. So, <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, innovations, and false superstitions must be kept away from it, because the people always look towards it. What is done in it is propagated around the world. So, if what is done in it is good, then good will spread about and if the opposite is the case, then evil will spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be kept pure always and for this reason, He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We enjoined Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel that they should purify My House for those people who make <em>tawwaaf</em>, and those who stay there for worship and those who bow and prostrate</strong>.</span>» [2:125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be purified from everything that conflicts with <em>Islaam</em>, so that the religion can emanate from it and the call to the East and Western parts of the Earth, because Allaah sent His Prophet in it and he began his call <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained in Makkah for thirteen years; from them were ten years in which he called to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbade from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> (only) and he was not commanded with anything other than that. He was not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting nor with <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> (the Pilgrimage). Rather his call was restricted to warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to commanding <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, you will be successful!</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they would say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does he make all the objects of worship a single object of worship? Indeed this is something very strange!</strong></span>» [38:5]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومعناها لا معبودَ بحقٍّ إلا اللهُ وحده؛ (لا إله) نافيًا جميعَ مَا يُعْبدُ مِنْ دونِ اللهِ (إلا الله) مُثْبِتًا العبادةَ له وحدَهُ لا شريكَ لهُ في عبادتِهِ، كما أنَّه ليس له شريك في مُلْكِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And its meaning is none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah; <em>laa ilaaha</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(nothing has the right to be worshipped)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is a negation of everything which is worshipped besides Allaah. <em>Illallaah</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(except Allaah) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">affirms worship for Allaah Alone, and that none is given any share of worship along with Him, just as He has no sharer in His Sovereignty</span>.</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>34</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">34</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And its meaning is none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</span></strong>”: the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> is not as is said by the people of falsehood: “there is no creator and there is no provider except Allaah”, because this is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship), the people of <em>shirk</em> agreed to that, but they would not say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا إِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَقُولُونَ أَئِنَّا لَتَارِكُو آلِهَتِنَا لِشَاعِرٍ مَّجْنُونٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When it was said to them, “<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>” </strong>(none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)<strong>, they became proud, and they say, “are we to abandon worshipping our gods for a crazy poet?”</strong></span> [37:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Aalihatinaa”</em> means: those things which we worship.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِشَاعِرٍ مَّجْنُونٍ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… in favour of a crazy poet?” </strong></span>[37:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They meant the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>they described him with poetry and madness, because he had said to them, “Say: <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>”, and he forbade them from the worship of idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he said to them, “Say: <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>”, they said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Has he made all of the objects of worship a single One to be worshipped? This is something very strange </strong></span>[38:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thought that there were many gods to be worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore this shows that its meaning is – nothing truly deserves worship except Allaah. Whereas if its meaning were – there is no creator and there is provider except Allaah – then they agreed to that, and they did not question it. So if that were its meaning they would not have refused to say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, because they used to say when they were asked, “Who created the heavens and the earth?”, they used to say, “Allaah”. And when they were asked, “Who creates? Who gives provision? Who gives life and gives death and who controls the earth?”, they used to say , “Allaah”. They acknowledged this. So if that were the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>then they would have consented to it. However its meaning is, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you were to say, “<strong>Nothing is worshipped except Allaah</strong>”, this would be a great error, because then all the objects of worship would be Allaah, High and Exalted is Allaah above this. Rather if you restrict it and you say, “<strong><em>bihaqq</em></strong>” (nothing is deservedly worshipped), then all the objects of worship are negated except Allaah the Perfect and Most High. You must therefore say, None has the right to be worshipped truly, meaning none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. Then he explained that in accordance with the wording of the saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>laa ilaaha</em></strong>: is a negation, it negates the right to worship from everything besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>illAllaah</em></strong>: this is affirmation of worship for Allaah alone with no partner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> includes negation and affirmation, and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> has to have negation and affirmation both. Affirmation alone will not suffice; and negation would not suffice on its own. There must be negation and affirmation, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever rejects the false objects of worship, and truly believes in and worships Allaah</span> </strong>[2:256]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah and do not associate anything in worship along with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you say, “Allaah is One who deserves worship”, this will not suffice, because <em>Al-Laat</em> is one who was worshipped, and <em>Al-‘Uzza</em> is one who was worshipped, and <em>Manaat</em> was an object of worship, all of the idols were called gods, or objects of worship. So therefore you must say, “<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>”, none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah – there must be combination between negation and affirmation so that therefore <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is actualized and <em>shirk</em> is negated.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">: وتفسيرها الذي يوضحها قوله تعالى</span></h3>
<p>And its explanation which will make it clear is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِي بَرَاءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِي فَطَرَنِي فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَاقِيَةً فِي عَقِبِهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father and to his people &#8220;I am totally free of everything that you worship except for the One who created me, for He will guide me&#8221;. And Allaah made it a saying to persist amongst his progeny so that they might remember and return to obedience to their Lord.</strong></span> [43:26-28] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>35</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">35</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best thing to explain the Qur&#8217;aan is the Qur&#8217;aan. So <em>la</em><em>a ilaaha illAllaah</em> has been explained by Allaah in the Qur&#8217;aan, and that is in the saying of His <em>Khaleel</em>, His specially chosen One (Ibraheem <em>&#8216;alaihi</em><em><u>s</u></em><em>alaatu wassalaam</em>), in that which Allaah mentioned from him:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِنَّنِي بَرَاءٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am totally free </strong></span>[43:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is negation; it has the same meaning of <em>laa ilaaha</em> (none has the right to be worshipped):<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِي فَطَرَنِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for the One who created me </strong></span>[43:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: except for Allaah. This is affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> is a complete and full explanation of the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say : O people of the Scripture, come to a word of justice between us that we will single out Allaah with all worship and will not worship anything else besides Him, nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah. Then if they turn away then say bear witness that we are Muslims submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for him.</span> </strong>[3:64]<strong> </strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>36</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">36</span>]  <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: O people of the Scripture, come to a word of justice between us that we will single out Allaah with all worship and will not worship anything else besides Him.</span> </strong>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> from <em>Soorah Aal-i-&#8216;Imraan</em> came down with regard to the deputation of Najraan, the Christians who came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> and debated him and asked him questions, and a long conversation occurred between them and him. They were Christians from the Christians of the Arabs. And in the end, the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> requested from them <em>Al-Mubaahala</em> (calling down Allaah’s curses upon whoever was lying):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَنِسَاءَنَا وَنِسَاءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وَأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَاذِبِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then say: Come, let us call our children and your children, our womenfolk and your womenfolk, ourselves and yourselves &#8211; then let us invoke and call down Allaah&#8217;s Curse upon the liars. </strong></span>[3:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he requested <em>al-Mubaahalah</em> (calling down curses upon the liars), they feared and they did not engage in calling down the curses along with him, <em>&#8216;alaihi</em><em><u>s</u></em><em>alaatu wassalaam</em>. Rather, they handed over the <em>Jizyah</em> because they knew that they were upon falsehood, and that he was the Messenger of Allaah, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">نبتهل</span>:</strong> Meaning, let us call the curse down upon the liar from us. They knew that they were the ones who were the liars, and if they had engaged in calling down curses, fire would have descended upon them and consumed them in their places. Therefore they said no, we won&#8217;t do so &#8211; rather, we will hand over the <em>Jizyah</em> (special tax) and we will not engage in calling Allaah&#8217;s curses down upon the liars. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> accepted the payment of <em>Jizyah </em>from them.  And it had become clear to them that Allaah had indeed commanded him with what was contained in this <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That we will not worship </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a negation. And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِلَّا اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Except Allaah</span>. </strong>[3:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the <em>&#8216;Adl</em> (justice) for which the heavens and the earth are established. So the heavens and the earth are established upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship) and upon <em>al-&#8216;Adl</em>. So we do not associate anything in worship along with Him, neither with the Messiah, whom they claim is a lord and whom they worship besides Allaah, nor anyone besides the Messiah, not even Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>&#8216;alaihi</em><em><u>s</u></em><em>alaatu wassalaam</em>, and not any one from the Prophets, not anyone from the righteous, nor anyone from the <em>awliyaa</em> (beloved servants of Allaah):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That we will not worship except Allaah, and we will not associate anything at all with Him. </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And we will not take one another as lords besides Allaah.</span> </strong>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Just as you (i.e. the people of the Book) have taken the Rabbis and monks as lords besides Allaah the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اتَّخَذُوا أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَانَهُمْ أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَالْمَسِيحَ ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allaah and </strong>(they)<strong> also </strong>(took as their Lord)<strong> the Messiah, son of Maryam, and they were not commanded except that they should worship a single God. </strong></span>[9:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The taking of rabbis and monks as lords besides Allaah is something which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> explained as being their obedience to them in declaring lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden and making forbidden that which Allaah had made lawful.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the meaning of their taking them as lords besides Allaah, since they used to declare lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden, and  declare forbidden which Allaah has made lawful. So the people obeying them upon that is taking them as Lords. This is because the One who legislates for the people and declares things to be lawful and forbidden for the people is Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So, if they turn away. </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (They) do not accept the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims </strong>(obedient to Allaah, worshiping Him alone)<strong>. </strong></span>[3:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They call them to bear witness that they were <em>muwa</em><em><u>h</u></em><em>iduun</em> (people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) and that they were <em>kuffaar</em> (unbelievers).  So they made clear to them the falsity of what they were upon. And this <em>aayah</em> shows <em>Al-Baraa&#8217;a</em> (freeing oneself) from the religion of the people of <em>shirk</em> and it clearly states &#8220;(We) bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; This contains the obligation of clearly announcing the falsity of what the people of <em>shirk</em> are upon and not remaining silent about it, and of clearly announcing the falsity of <em>shirk</em> and of refuting its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">In summary:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) has<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> two pillars</strong></span>, and they are:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>An-Nafee</em></strong></span> (negation) and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-Ithbaat</em> </span></strong>(affirmation).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it is said to you: What are the pillars of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>? Then say, negation and affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Its conditions are seven</strong></span>, and it (saying the <em>shahadah</em>) will not benefit except with these conditions; someone has written them in a line of poetry and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge, certainty, purity and sincerity and your being truthful </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>                             Along with love, compliance, and acceptance of them</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1.Knowledge</strong></span>: Its opposite is ignorance, so the person who says <em>Laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> with his tongue, but is ignorant of its meaning, then <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> will not benefit him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2.Certainty</span></strong>: Such that he does not have any doubt. This is because some people may know its meaning, however, they have a doubt about it, so his knowledge is not correct. He must have certainty of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and that it is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3.Purity and Sincerity:</span></strong> Its opposite is <em>ash-Shirk</em>. Some people say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, but they do not abandon <em>shirk</em> as is presently the case today with the worshippers of the graves. Those people will not be benefited by (saying) <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> because from its conditions is abandoning <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4.Being truthful:</span></strong> Its opposite is falsehood and lying. This is because the <em>munaafiquun</em> say <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, but they are liars in their hearts; they do not believe its meaning. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اتَّخَذُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the hypocrites come to you, they say: &#8220;We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allaah indeed.&#8221; But Allaah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars. They take their oaths as a shield to screen them. </strong></span>[63:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>5.Love</strong></span>: That the person loves this saying and is an ally to its people. As for the person who does not love it or does not love its people, then it will not benefit him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>6.Compliance</strong></span>: It is the opposite of turning away from it and abandoning it, and it is complying with what it (this saying) indicates with regard to worshipping Allaah Alone and not associating anything with Him, and it is complying with His commands. Since you have acknowledged and have borne witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah Alone, then it becomes binding upon you to comply with His rulings and His religion. As for your saying <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>, and you do not comply with His legislations, then <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> will not benefit you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">7.Acceptance</span></strong>: Acceptance which negates <em>Ar-Rad</em> (rejection) &#8211; such that you do not reject anything from the rights of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and whatever it indicates. Rather, you accept everything which <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> indicates and you accept it correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an eighth condition is added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And the eighth is added; rejecting whatever things are </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>worshipped besides the One who is truly worshipped</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">8</span></strong>.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Freeing oneself from </strong></span><em><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shirk</strong></span>.</em> So a person will not be a <em>muwa</em><em><u>h</u></em><em>id</em> (a person of <em>taw</em><em><u>h</u></em><em>eed</em>) until he frees himself from <em>shirk</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِي بَرَاءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Ibraaheem said to his father and his people: I am totally free of whatever you worship</span>.</strong> [43:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the conditions of <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> &#8211; eight conditions.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Refer to the <u>h</u>adeeth of &#8216;Alee ibn Haatim <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em> that was reported by At-Tirmidhee (3095). In it Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>

And when they declared something forbidden for them, they would take it as being forbidden.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Shaikh Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> declared this <u>h</u>adeeth as <em><u>h</u>asan</em> (good)].</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>



<p>So the proof for the <em>shahaadah</em> (testification) is:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">شَهِدَ اللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَأُولُو الْعِلْمِ قَائِمًا بِالْقِسْطِ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Him; and likewise the Angels and the people of knowledge bear witness. He Who maintains justice, none has the right to be worshipped but Him, the All-Mighty the All-Wise </strong></span>[3:18]<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>33</sup></span></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>]:<strong>&nbsp;Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">His saying, He the Most High, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He testified</strong></span>&#8220;: meaning He judged and He decreed and He informed and He made clear and He made it binding.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So bearing witness from Allaah revolves around these five meanings: judging and decreeing and and informing and clarifying and making binding. So the meaning of, &#8220;He testified&#8221;, is He the Perfect and Most High decreed it upon His servants and He calls them to know of it and He informed them and He made it binding upon them that none has the right to be worshipped except Him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>laa ilaaha</em></span></strong>”, (none had the right to be worshipped): this is a negating ‘<em>laa’</em> which negates everything which is worshipped besides Allaah</p>



<p>“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>illaahu</em></span></strong>”, (except for Him): this affirms worship for Allaah alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the meaning of, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>annahu laailaaha illaahu</em></strong></span>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but him): it means there is nothing that is worshipped rightfully except&nbsp; Allaah the Perfect and Most High. As for those who are worshipped besides Allaah, then worship of it is false because of His saying He the Most High:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the true God deserving all worship and those whom they call upon besides Him are futile and false and Allaah He is the Most High the Most Great </strong></span>[22:62]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">He the Perfect and Most High testifies to His unity and the right to all worship and He is the most truthful One Who speaks and His bearing witness He the Perfect and Most High is the truest testification there can be because it comes from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware, All-Knowing, he knows everything so therefore it is a testification which is true.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the Angels</strong></span>&#8220;: they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and they are a species of beings whom Allaah created to worship Him. They are honourable Angels, honoured servants, Allaah created them to worship Him. They declare His perfection night and day, and they never slacken. And also Allaah created them to carry out His commands in the creation, He entrusted them with implementing whatever He commanded, He the Perfect and Most High, from the affairs of the creation. So every Angel from them is entrusted with a duty. And their testification is a true testification, because they are people of knowledge, and of ‘<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) and of <em>ma‘rifah</em> (awareness) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they are from the most excellent of the creation, along with the point of disagreement which is are the righteous humans more excellent than the Angels, or are the Angels more excellent than the righteous humans there being disagreement about that point.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the people of knowledge</strong></span>”: they are of two categories: the Angels, and the second category are the Possessors of Knowledge from mankind. And the Possessors of Knowledge do not testify except with something that is true, contrary to the case with those who are ignorant people, for their testification is not counted. And every species from the creation of Allaah bears witness for Allaah of His Unity and that none has the right to be worshipped but Him. And this is a case of showing the honour and nobility of the people of knowledge since Allaah joined their testification along with His testification, He the Perfect and Most High, and with the testification of His Angels. He counted the testification of the people of knowledge from the creation, and this shows their excellence and their nobility and their status, and they are testifying to the greatest matter that can be testified to, and it is <em>at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And what is meant by the Possessors of Knowledge – are the people of knowledge of the Legislation (i.e. Islamic knowledge), not as is said by some people that people of knowledge means the people of industry and agriculture, so those people, it is not said about them that they are People of Knowledge unrestrictedly, because their knowledge is limited in scope and is restricted, rather it is to be said, “this person is knowledgeable about arithmetic, this person is knowledgeable about engineering, this person is knowledgeable about medicine”, but it is not said about them that they are the People of Knowledge unrestrictedly. Because this term is not used unrestrictedly except for the people who have Islamic knowledge. And also most of those people are people who have only worldly knowledge, and amongst them are atheists whose knowledge mostly only increases them in ignorance concerning Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and in self delusion and in atheism as you can see today in the disbelieving nations, that they are advanced with regards to industries and with regards to agriculture, however they are disbelievers. So how could it be said that they are the People of Knowledge, those whom Allaah has mentioned in His saying, “and the Possessors of Knowledge”. This is not at all feasible.</p>



<p>And likewise His saying:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</span></h3>



<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is only those who have Knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah </strong></span>[35:28]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">What is meant is the scholars of Islamic knowledge, those who truly know Allaah and who truly worship Him and who fear Him. As for those people, then most of them do not fear Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Rather they disbelieve in Allaah and deny Him, and they claim that the world has no Lord and that rather nature brought it about and controls it, as is the case with the communists – they reject the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, even though they have worldly knowledge. So how then could we say – those people, they are the People of Knowledge? This is an error. So the term ‘Knowledge’ is not applied unrestrictedly except to its true people, and it is a noble title which cannot be applied to atheists and disbelievers, such that it is said, “they are the people of Knowledge”.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So the Angels and the possessors of Knowledge, they bear witness to Allaah’s Unity and sole right to worship. Therefore the saying of others besides them from the atheists and the people of <em>shirk</em> and the Sabeans, those who disbelieve in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, is not counted. Those people, they are not counted, neither they nor their saying, because it is something contrary to the testification of Allaah and the testification of His Angels and the testification of those possessing knowledge from His Creation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And His saying,<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “<em>Qaa’imam bil-Qis<u>t</u></em>”</span></strong>, (maintaining justice): this phrase is in the accusative case indicating a state along with, ‘He bore witness’ – meaning whilst establishing justice, He the Perfect and Most High. And the word, “<em>al-Qis<u>t</u></em>”, means <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice) – meaning Allaah the Perfect and Most High establishes justice in everything, and <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice) is the opposite of <em>al-jawr</em> (injustice), and He the Perfect and Most High is a just judge, nothing but justice comes from Him in everything.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Laa ilaaha illahu</em></span></strong>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but Him): this emphasizes the first sentence.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-‘Azeez-ul-<u>H</u>akeem</em></span></strong>”, (the Almighty the All-Wise): these are two Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, comprising two Attributes from His Attributes, and they are <em>al-‘Izzah</em> (Might) and <em>al-<u>H</u>ikmah</em> (Wisdom).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fundamental Principle: Knowledge of the Religion of Islaam</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Definition of the Religion (Ad-Deen)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الأصلُ الثَّاني: معرفةُ دينِ الإسلامِ بالأدلةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second fundamental principle: knowledge of the religion of Islaam with its proofs.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>27</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">27</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, having finished explaining knowledge of the first fundamental principle, which was knowledge of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, with the evidences, he now moves on to explaining the second fundamental principle, and it is knowledge of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he said, “<strong>The second fundamental principle: knowledge and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs</strong>.” Then he mentioned its definition and he explained its meaning and then he mentioned its levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">knowledge of the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam</span></strong>”. <em>Ad-Deen</em> – it means obedience, for it is said about a person, <em>daana lahu</em>, when he obeys him with regard to what he commanded, and he abandons what he forbade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>Ad-Deen</em> is used to mean <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab </em>(bringing to account or reckoning), just as occurs in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Sovereign Owner of the Day of Reckoning </strong></span>[1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said, “daanahu”, meaning he brought him to account, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ مَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And what will cause you to understand what is the Day of the Reckoning? Then what will cause you to understand what is the Day of the Reckoning? </strong></span>[82:17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Day of the Reckoning.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ لَا تَمْلِكُ نَفْسٌ لِّنَفْسٍ شَيْئًا ۖ وَالْأَمْرُ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when no soul will possess any benefit for any other soul, and the whole affair on that Day will be for Allaah.</span> </strong>[82:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>with the proofs</strong></span>”, meaning: knowledge of the religion of Islaam cannot be by way of blind following, or by way of conjecture from the person. The religion must be based upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah. As for the person who does not know his religion, rather he just blindly follows the rest of the people and he is just a follower of whatever the rest of the people do, then this person does not know his religion as he should, and it is quite appropriate that when he is asked in the grave, that he should say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هاه ، هاه ، لا أدري ، سمعت الناس يقولون شي ئا فقلته</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Haa, Haa, I do not know. I heard the people saying something, so I said it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (1338) and by Muslim (2870) in abridged form from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaah ‘anhu</em>. The full version of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Aboo Daawood (4753) from a <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/10/17/punishment-of-the-grave-the-hadeeth-of-al-baraa-bin-aazib/"><u>h</u>adeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib </a><em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaah‘ anhu.</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory on a person that he should gain knowledge and awareness of his religion with the proofs from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, and he will not know this except through learning.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو الاستسلامُ له بالتوحيدِ، والانقيادِ له بالطاعةِ، والبراءةُُ مِنَ الشِّركِ وأهلِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is to submit to Him with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to yield to Him with obedience and to free oneself from <em>shirk</em> and its people</strong></span>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>28</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">28</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Islaam is derived from, “<strong><em>aslama lish-shay</em></strong>”, meaning he submitted to it. As it is said in the language, “<em>aslama nafsahu lilqatl</em>”, (he submitted himself to being killed)”, meaning that he submitted to being killed. So a person did <em>islaam</em> of himself, means that he submitted to that thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore Islaam is submitting one&#8217;s face and one&#8217;s purpose and resolve and one&#8217;s intention to Him, he the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And who is better in religion than one who submits his face to Allaah and he is the doer of the good which Allaah legislated and he follows the religious way of Ibraaheem, upright and upon his way, turning away from shirk </strong></span>[4:125]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Rather whoever submits his face to Allaah </strong></span>[2:112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and he yields to Allaah obediently and by choice and with desire and out of love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Submitting to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>”: and it is to single out Allaah the majestic and most high with worship, and this is the meaning of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So whoever worships Allaah alone without attributing a partner to Him, then he has indeed submitted to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And yielding to Him, He the Perfect with obedience</span></strong>&#8220;: regarding whatever He has commanded you with and whatever He has forbidden you from. So whatever He commanded you with then you do it and whatever He forbids you from then you avoid it, in obedience to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>and freeing oneself from <em>shirk</em> and its people</strong></span>&#8220;: freeing oneself means cutting off from and separating from and being far removed from <em>shirk</em> and from the people of <em>shirk</em>, such that you believe the falsity of <em>shirk</em> and keep away from it. And you believe in the obligation of having enmity towards the people of <em>shirk</em> because they are enemies to Allaah, the mighty and majestic, so therefore you do not take them as beloved friends and allies, rather you take them as enemies because they are enemies to Allaah and to his Messenger and to His religion so therefore you do not have love for them and you do not have love and alliance with them rather you cut off from them with regard to the religion and you distance yourself from them and you believe in the falseness of what they are upon so therefore you do not love then with your heart and you do not aid them with your sayings and your actions, because they are enemies to your Lord, and enemies to your religion so how can you have love and alliance with them when they are enemies of Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not sufficient that you submit to Allaah and yield to him with obedience but do not free yourself from <em>shirk</em> and nor from the people of <em>shirk</em>, this will not suffice, you will not be counted as being a Muslim until you have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> submitting to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> yielding to him with obedience</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> freeing oneself from that which opposes <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and that which opposes obedience and it is <em>shirk</em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong> freeing oneself from the people of <em>shirk</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By actualizing these characteristics you will be a Muslim, as for if you miss out on a single characteristic from them then you will not be a Muslim. So in these three words the Shaikh summarized the definition of Islaam and how many a person does not know the meaning of Islaam because he has not learned this thing, and if it were said to him, &#8220;<strong>What is Islaam?</strong>&#8220;, he will not give you a correct response.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Levels of the Religion</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو ثلاثُ مراتبَ: الإسلامُ، والإيمانُ، والإحسانُ<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is of three levels: <em>Al-Islaam</em></strong>,</span><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Al-Eemaan</em> and </span></strong><em><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</strong></span> </em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of levels is ascending levels because we have said Islaam is of three levels, some of them being higher than others. The first level from the levels of the religion is Islaam, then after it comes <em>eemaan</em>, then after it comes <em>i<u>h</u>saan. </em>So therefore Islaam is broader, and <em>eemaan</em> is something more restricted than Islaam, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is more restricted than <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sphere of Islaam is wide, the hypocrites, they enter within it if they outwardly comply with Islaam and they outwardly display it and they outwardly adhere to it. If they pray along with the Muslims and they give the <em>zakaat </em>and they do the outward actions, then they are called Muslims and the rulings of the Muslims apply upon them in this world, so they have whatever the Muslims have and upon them will be whatever is upon the Muslims. However in the Hereafter they will be in the lowest depths of the fire because they do not have <em>eemaan</em> rather they just have outward apparent Islaam only.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<em>Al-Eemaan</em>&#8220;: this is the second level, and the people who have <em>eemaan</em> they vary in their levels so from them are <strong><em>Al-Muqarraboon</em></strong> (those who draw especially close through good deeds), and from them are <strong><em>Al-Abraar</em> </strong>(the righteous ones). <em>Al-Muqarraboon</em> &#8211; they are the people of the highest of the levels, and <em>Al-Abraar</em> are lesser than them, and from them there are those who are the person who is one who wronged himself, and he is the one who commits major sins which are less than <em>shirk</em>. Then he is a sinful believer or he is a believer who is deficient in <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۖ فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then we gave the Scripture as inheritance to those whom we chose from our servants. So from them are those who wrong themselves and from them are those who take a middle course and from them are those who are foremost upon good deeds by the permission of Allaah, and that is the great bounty </strong></span>[35:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong>”: this is the third level and it is <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan, </em>and it is that the servant does well with regards to what is between him and Allaah, he does well in the worship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">الإحسان أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Al-I<u>h</u>saan </em></strong><strong>is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing him and even though you do not see him then he certainly sees you&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[A part of the long hadeeth reported by al-Bukhaaree (50) and by Muslim (9 and 10) from a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you have certain knowledge that Allaah sees you wherever you may be.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وكلُّ مرتبةٍ لها أركانٌ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And every level has pillars.</span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>31</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">31</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">and every level has pillar</span>s</strong>&#8220;: pillars is the plural of a pillar, and it is that which something stands upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the pillars of something are its aspects which it stands upon, and it cannot stand without them, and they are within the thing itself, contrary to conditions, for they are outside the thing. For example the conditions of the prayer then they are outside the prayer and come before it. And as for the pillars of the prayer, then they are inside it such as the initial <em>takbeer </em>of the prayer and the recitation of al-Faati<u>h</u>ah, so if anything from them is missing, then the prayer will not be correct, just as if there was something missing from the pillars which hold up a building then it will not stand and will not be supported.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The pillars of Islaam</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فأركانُ الإسلامِ خمسةٌ: شهادةُ أنْ لا إله إلاّ اللهُ، وأنَّ محمدًا رسولُ اللهِ، وإقامُ الصلاةِ، وإيتاءُ الزكاةِ، وصومُ رمضانَ، وحجُّ بيتِ اللهِ الحرامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So the pillars of Islaam are five, the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and establishing the prayer, and giving the zakaat and fasting Rama<u>d</u>aan and performing <u>H</u>ajj to Allaah’s sacred house</span></strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>32</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">32</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islaam will not stand except with these pillars, if they are missing than Islaam will not be upright and the rest of the acts of obedience are matters of completion for these pillars. All the actions of obedience and all good deeds are all actions of completion of these pillars and therefore when Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> asked Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>in the presence of the Companions saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخبرني عن الإسلام ، قال : الإسلام أن تشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، وتقيم الصلاة ، وتؤتي الزكاة ، وتصوم رمضان ، وتحج البيت إن استطعت إليه سبيلا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Inform me about Islaam. He replied: Islaam is that you bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and that you establish the prayer and that you give the <em>zakaat</em> and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make your way to it&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he explained Islaam to be these five pillars, however the <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Umar makes it clear that these five are the foundations of Islaam so he <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بني الإسلام على خمس</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Islaam is built upon five&#8221; <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3"></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3"></a></strong><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (8) and by Muslim (16) from a hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em> ]</span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that these five are not the whole of Islaam rather they are its pillars and its foundations which it rests upon and the rest of the legislated matters are things which perfect and complete these pillars.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو دعوةُ غيرهِ معهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is to call upon other than Him along with Him.</span></strong><sup>19</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the definition of <em>shirk</em>: it is to call upon other than Him along with Him – meaning that something from <em>‘ibaadah </em>(worship) is directed to other than Allaah, whether it be (to) an angel from the angels or a prophet from the prophets or a righteous person from the righteous people or a building from the buildings or other than that from all the created beings. So whoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah, then this is the greatest thing that Allaah has forbidden. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know the explanation of <em>tawheed </em>and the explanation of <em>shirk </em>because there are from the people those who explain <em>tawheed </em>with other than its true explanation and those who explain <em>shirk </em>with other than its true explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people are those who say, “<em>Shirk </em>is<em> shirk </em>with regards to <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/17/haakimiyyahalbaani/"><em><u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>(judgement and legislation)</a>”. And this has appeared now unfortunately. <em>Al-<u>H</u>ukm bi ghayri ma anzal Allaah  </em>(judging by other than that which Allaah sent down) is a type from the types of <em>shirk </em>called <em>shirk-ut-<u>T</u>aa‘ah </em>(<em>shirk </em>of obedience). There is no doubt that obeying a created being in declaring lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden or in declaring forbidden that which Allaah has made lawful, <em>this</em> is a type of <em>shirk </em> &#8211; however there is that which is more serious than it and it is worshipping other than Allaah by slaughtering and making vows and performing <em>tawaaf</em> (circumambulation) and calling for rescue. So what is obligatory is to warn against all <em>shirk</em>, not to take up something from it and to leave aside that which is worse and more dangerous than it. So <em>shirk </em>is not to be explained as being only <em>shirk-ul-<u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>or <em>shirk </em>in political affairs. And (these people) say: “Shirk of the graves, this is just simple shirk”, meaning it is something easy. This is insolence towards Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. <em>Shirk </em>is the worst thing that Allaah has forbidden and it is to call upon something else besides Him along with Him. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who say that, “<em>Shirk </em>is to have love of the<em> dunyaa </em>(worldly life) and to have love of wealth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wealth is something which Allaah has made beloved (to people) with their natural love.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتُحِبُّونَ الْمَالَ حُبًّا جَمًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you love wealth with immense love.</span> </strong>[89:20]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (man)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is certainly fervent in love of </span><em><span style="color:#008000;">khayr</span> </em></strong>[100:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (of) wealth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كَانَ آبَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَاؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَالٌ اقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَارَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَاكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَجِهَادٍ فِي سَبِيلِهِ فَتَرَبَّصُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: If your fathers and your children…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">are more beloved to you.</span> </strong>[9:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: <strong>‘are more beloved to you’</strong>, and He did not criticize them for loving them (their fathers, their children, etc). Rather He criticized them for giving precedence to love of them over the love of Allaah. Love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is a natural love. The people have need of wealth and they love it; love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is (a case) of love of things which are beneficial through which the people derive benefit. However those people who say these sayings  (that shirk is love of wealth) &#8211; either they are ignorant people who do not know <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>and <em>shirk</em> – or otherwise they are people who deliberately turn away, wishing to turn the people away from these realities towards things which they want and purposes which they desire . And Allaah knows best about people’s intentions and goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that this is not <em>shirk; shirk </em>is to call upon other than Allaah along with Him or to direct anything from the types of worship to other than Allaah  &#8211; such as sacrifice, and making vows, and supplicating and calling for rescue and seeking aid and turning for refuge and fear and hope and other than that &#8211; this is <em>shirk </em>which is the greatest of sins, calling upon other than Him along with Him, He the Perfect and Most High, because <em>ad-Du‘aa </em>(supplication) is the greatest type of worship, just as He, the One free of all imperfections, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُم بِشَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The True Call is that which is for Allaah; and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot respond to them with anything</strong>.</span> [13:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَادْعُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So call upon Allaah, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him even though the disbelievers detest it. </strong></span>[40:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So supplicating to other than Allaah is the <em>shirk </em>which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. As for these lesser matters which they declare <em>shirk </em>to be then that is not the case. However it is to be said: some of them are a part of <em>shirk; </em>however there is that which is more dangerous than it and more important than it because shirk is of levels, some of them are worse than others. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him</span></strong> [4:36] <sup>20</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]:  <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]”:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have said that the proof that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned the rest of the rights (in the rest of the above ayah). So the fact that He began with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and with the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>, this is a proof that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the greatest thing which Allaah has commanded because He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah..</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He followed it with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a prohibition. He began with the command for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the prohibition from <em>shirk</em>. So this proves that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the worst thing that He has forbidden is <em>shirk</em>, because Allaah began with that. And He, the Perfect, does not begin except with the most important thing and then what is next in importance. This is the way in which the <em>aayah </em>is a proof.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Most Serious Thing Which Allaah Forbade is <em>Shirk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأعظمُ ما نهى عنه الشركُ<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk </em></strong></span><sup>18</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying – <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>– “And the most serious thing which Allaah forbade is <em>shirk</em>”: This is a tremendous point of benefit because some people believe that there are things which are the worst crimes and the worst thing which Allaah has forbidden, saying, “Ribaa (usury) is the most serious of the forbidden things! Fornication is the greatest of forbidden things!” And therefore they focus upon forbidding ribaa and upon fornication and corruption of manners and behaviour. However they do not give importance to the matter of <em>shirk</em> and they do not warn against it and (yet) they see the people falling into it. So this is a case of tremendous ignorance of the <em>Sharee‘ah</em> (revealed law) of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the most serious thing which Allaah forbade is <em>shirk</em>, so it is more serious than usury and it is more serious than drinking alcohol and more serious than stealing and more serious than falsely devouring the wealth of the people and more serious than betting  and gambling; it is the most serious of the forbidden things. And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُم مِّنْ إِمْلَاقٍ ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ ۖ وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۖ وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُوا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۖ وَبِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ أَوْفُوا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come, I will recite to you what my Lord has truly forbidden for you: Do not associate anything along with Allaah, and treat the parents well, and do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We shall provide for you and for them. And do not approach shameful sins, whether apparent or hidden, and do not kill the soul which Allaah has forbidden, except by right. This is what He has commanded you with so that you may understand. And do not approach the wealth of the orphan except in a manner which is best .. [6:151-152]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. to the end of the aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these <em>aayaat</em> are called the <span style="color:#ff0000;">ten commandments</span>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come, I will recite to you what my Lord has truly forbidden for you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is what He has enjoined you with so that you may understand.</strong></span> [6:151-152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These forbidden acts – Allaah began them with His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not associate anything along with Allaah&#8230; </strong></span>[6:151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the most serious thing which Allaah has forbidden.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in <em>Soorat-ul-Israa</em> – Allaah, the Most High,said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتَقْعُدَ مَذْمُومًا مَّخْذُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not set up another object of worship along with Allaah and so become one who is blameworthy and forsaken! </strong></span>[17:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began with a prohibition of <em>shirk </em>and He concluded it with a forbiddance of <em>shirk</em>:<em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ مِمَّا أَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ رَبُّكَ مِنَ الْحِكْمَةِ ۗ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتُلْقَىٰ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا مَّدْحُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not set up another object of worship along with Allaah so that you are cast into Hellfire rebuked and banished! </strong></span>[17:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that it is the most serious thing that Allaah has forbidden. This proves the saying of the Shaykh, “and the greatest thing that Allaah forbade is shirk.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>‘Which sin is greatest?’</b> </span><b><span style="color:#000000;">He said, “That you set up a rival for Allaah and (yet) it is He who created you.” It was said, ‘Then which (sin)?’ He said, “That you kill your child for fear that he will consume food along with you.” It was said: ‘Then which (sin)?’ He said, “That you commit adultery with the wife of your neighbour.”</span> </b><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (6861) and Muslim (86) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah sent down the confirmation of that in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ وَلَا يَقْتُلُونَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ وَلَا يَزْنُونَ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَامًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the servants of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan</em></span><span style="color:#008000;"> are)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who do not call upon another deity along with Allaah and they do not kill the soul which Allaah has made forbidden except by right, and they do not commit fornication. And whoever does </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(these things) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">will receive punishment.</span> </strong>[25:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began with <em>shirk</em> in his saying, “<strong>That you set up a rival for Allaah”, </strong>meaning: a partner, “<strong>and (yet) it is He who created you.”</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said that this is the greatest of sins because he was asked “which sin is greatest?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began with <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Keep away from the seven destructive sins.” So it was said, ‘What are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, “Committing shirk with Allaah, and sorcery and killing the soul which Allaah has made forbidden, except with right.”</span></strong>.. to the end of the hadeeth.<em> <strong> </strong></em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree (2766) and Muslim (89) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iallaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began it with <em>shirk </em>so this shows that <em>shirk </em>is the greatest of all sins and that is because the person of <em>shirk</em> will never enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ ۖ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever makes <em>shirk  </em>with Allaah, then Allaah has made Paradise forbidden for him; and his abode will be the Hellfire. And the disbelieving wrongdoers will have no helper. </strong></span>[5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will not forgive the <em>mushrik</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk </em>be committed with Him and He forgives whatever is less than that to whomsoever He wishes. </strong></span>[4:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that Paradise is forbidden for the person of <em>shirk </em>and that Allaah will not forgive him and it proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of all sins since all sins &#8211;  except for <em>shirk</em> – can be met with forgiveness:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk </em>be committed with Him and He forgives whatever is less than that to whomsoever He wishes.</span> </strong>[4:48]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fornication and theft and drinking alcohol and taking usury  &#8211; all of it enters under <em>al-mashee’ah </em>(Allaah’s Wish and Will)  &#8211; if Allaah wishes, He will forgive its person and if He wishes, He will punish him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>shirk</em>, then it will not be forgiven. Allaah has passed judgement that He will not forgive it. And likewise the person of sin &#8211; even if he has committed major sins which are less than <em>shirk</em> then Paradise will not be forbidden for him. His final destination will be Paradise.  Either Allaah will forgive him straightaway and enter him into Paradise or else he will come out of the Fire after having been punished in it and he will (then) enter into Paradise. No matter what evil and sins which are less than <em>shirk</em> occur from the believer then he will not despair of the Mercy of Allaah and he will not be forbidden from Paradise, and he enters under the forgiveness (of Allaah) by the Wish and Will of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of <em>shirk </em>then he will be deprived and forbidden of all of that  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – then this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of all sins. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Shirk</em></strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is the greatest <em><u>z</u>ulm (</em>wrongdoing)</span>. </strong>[31:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect, said:<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَىٰ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever commits <em>shirk </em>with Allaah then he has invented a tremendous sin! </strong></span>[4:48]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever commits <em>shirk </em>with Allaah then he has indeed strayed far away from the True Path! </strong></span>[4:116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of sins and since <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of sins then it is obligatory upon the scholars and the educated people to forbid it and to warn against it and that they do not remain silent from warning against <em>shirk</em>. And it is obligatory to fight <em>jihaad</em> against the people of <em>shirk</em> along with ability just as Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>fought <em>jihaad</em> against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاقْتُلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَخُذُوهُمْ وَاحْصُرُوهُمْ وَاقْعُدُوا لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then kill the people of <em>shirk</em> wherever you find them and seize them and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush.</strong></span> [9:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is therefore obligatory to warn against <em>shirk</em> and to clarify it to the people so that they avoid it; this is what is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for remaining silent about <em>shirk</em> and leaving the people passionately involved in worshipping other than Allaah whilst they claim to be upon Islaam – and there is no one forbidding them and no one warning them – then the matter is very serious. There are some people who turn their attention to forbidding usury and fornication and corruption of manners; these are forbidden matters and contain corruption however <em>shirk</em> is more serious. So why is attention not given to forbidding <em>shirk</em> and warning against <em>shirk</em> and explaining what many people have fallen into with regards to major <em>shirk</em> whilst they claim to be upon Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why is there laxity with regards to the matter of <em>shirk</em> and disregard of it and leaving the people to fall into it and (yet) the people of knowledge are present? Indeed they live along with those people and (yet) they remain silent with them. What is obligatory is to turn attention firstly to forbidding this tremendous danger (of <em>shirk</em>) which has devastated the Muslim nation. Every sin is less than it and what is obligatory is to begin with what is most important, then with what is next in importance.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Greatest Matter Commanded by Allaah is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأعظمُ ما أَمرَ اللهُ به التوحيدَ وهو إفرادُ اللهِ بالعبادة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the greatest of all that Allaah has commanded is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and it is to single out Allaah with all worship</span></strong>. <sup>17</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “The greatest of all that Allaah has commanded is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>”: this is very important, that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded. All the commands that Allaah has commanded, all of them, come after tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah alone, and do not associate anything with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To the end of the <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains <strong>ten rights</strong>, and therefore it is called the <strong><em>aayah</em> of the ten rights</strong>. The first of these rights is the right of Allaah the Perfect:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah alone, and do not associate anything with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And treat the parents well </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the second right.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the close relatives </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the third right, and the close relatives, they are those people to whom you are closely related through your father or mother, such as fathers and grandfathers, and paternal uncles and paternal aunts, maternal uncles and maternal aunts, and brothers and sisters, and children of brothers and sisters, and children of paternal uncles and paternal aunts, those people are the close relatives, they have the right of <em>al-Qaraabah</em> (of being your close relative).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Wal-yataamaa</em>” (and the orphans), – the orphans from the Muslims, and they are everyone whose father has died whilst he was young and he had not attained the age of puberty, and therefore he needs someone to take the place of his father in taking care of this child, bringing him up, spending upon him and seeing to his welfare, and removing whatever will harm him, because he has no father to protect him and spend upon him and defend him, so he has a need of someone to help him because he has lost his father and his family, and he has a right in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is that Allaah began it with His right, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not associate anything along with Him</strong></span> [4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not restrict Himself to saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah</span> </strong>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because worship will not be correct along with <em>shirk</em> and it will not benefit, and it will not be called worship unless it is made purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. If it has <em>shirk</em> along with it, then it will not be worship, no matter how much the person exerts himself in its performance. So He joined the matter of worship with the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>, since worship will not be correct with the presence of <em>shirk</em> at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the saying of the Shaikh, “The greatest thing that Allaah commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>”, since Allaah began many <em>aayahs</em> with it, from them is this aayah, and from them is His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord has commanded that you should not worship except Him </strong></span>[17:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect and Most High began with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and this proves that it is the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُم مِّنْ إِمْلَاقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come I will recite to you that which your Lord has truly forbidden for you: do not associate anything in worship with Him, and treat the parents well, and do not kill your children on account of poverty </strong></span>[6:151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for what will follow, that the greatest thing that Allaah has forbidden is <em>shirk</em>. So since the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, then it is obligatory that the person begins by learning <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief) before everything. Correct creed and belief is the foundation, so it is obligatory that the person begins with it in learning and teaching and that he is constant upon teaching it and explaining it to the people, because it is the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded, so it is not befitting that you make it the last of all things or give no great attention to it, because now there are actually callers who renounce the teaching of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and <em>‘aqeedah</em>, there are people who are afflicted with this. And because any deficiencies with regard to it will be a deficiency in the whole of the religion so it is obligatory to give careful attention to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is <em>tawheed </em>? Is it that you affirm that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the Giver of life, the Giver of death? No. <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is: to single out Allaah with worship, because Allaah said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me</span>. </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of <em>tafseer </em>said: <strong>Worship Me – </strong>meaning single Me out (with all worship). So they explained <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>as <em>‘ibaadah </em>(worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is to single out Allaah with worship and it is not to affirm that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the Giver of life, the Giver of death, the One in control of affairs because this is present in people’s <em>fi<u>t</u>rah </em>(inborn nature). It is present in the intellects of those who possess intellect. There is not a person of intellect in the world who truly believes that anyone created the Heavens and the Earth besides Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. There is not in the whole world anyone – and that includes the unbelievers and the atheists &#8211; who truly believes that there is anyone from mankind who created mankind.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to ask them (the people of <em>shirk</em>) who created them, they would certainly say, “Allaah!”</span> </strong>[43:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not a person with intellect in the whole world who believes truly that a human can create a human being who walks upon the Earth and speaks and eats and drinks. Is there a person with intellect who believes this?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Were they created without any Creator having brought them into existence? Or are they the creators? Or did they create the Heavens and the Earth? Rather they do not have certainty. </strong></span>[52:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship) is something found in the inborn natures and in their intellects; however it will not suffice without <em>taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-‘ibaadah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship) – and it is to single out Allaah with all worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the Shaykh said: <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is to single out Allaah with worship and it is not to single out Allaah with respect to creating and providing and giving life and giving death because this is something which is known and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship) will not suffice with regard to the definition of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبذلك أَمَرَ اللهُ جميعَ الناس وخلَقهم لها</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And that is what Allaah commanded the whole of mankind with and He created them for it</strong></span>.<sup>15</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And that is what Allaah commanded</strong>”: the indication refers to his saying, “That you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him”. And Allaah commanded the whole of the creation with the worship of Allaah making the whole of the religion purely and sincerely for Him, Allaah commanded the whole of mankind the Arabs from them and the non-Arabs, the white and the black from them, all of mankind from the time of Aadam until the last of mankind in the world, Allaah commanded all of them to worship Him, along with making the worship purely and solely for Him. Allaah the most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be from those who fear and are dutiful to Allaah </strong>(who avoid His punishment)<strong>. He Who made the earth a resting-place for you and made the sky a ceiling and He sent down from the clouds rain and He brought out with it from the earth crops and fruits as provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allaah whilst you know. </strong></span>[2:21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there is no rival for Him and there is no-one resembling Him, and there is no-one like Him, and there is no equal for Him. So this is a prohibition of major <em>shirk</em> and lesser <em>shirk</em>. Allaah commanded all of mankind with that from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And He created them for it”: meaning to worship Him alone associating no partners with Him, He the one free of all imperfections, they were created for that purpose, that is just as occurs in His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone.</span> </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they were commanded with that in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind single out your Lord with all worship, the one who created you</span> </strong>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of the saying of the Shaikh, ‘He created them for it, and He commanded them with it’, he combined the two matters in his saying, “And Allaah commanded the whole of mankind with that and He created them for it”, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone</span>. </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind .. </span></strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, He is the Creator, He is the one who created all things, and from that is that He created the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind, and He gave them intellect, and He gave them the duty of worshipping Him alone and not associating anything along with Him. He particularized them with the command to worship Him because Allaah gave them intellects, and He gave them that by means of which they can they can distinguish between what is harmful and what is of benefit, and between the truth and falsehood, and He created all things for their welfare and benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مِّنْهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He has made subservient for you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is upon the earth all of it is a favour from Him. </strong></span>[45:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything has been made subservient for the descendants of Aadam in order that they should use it as an aid upon that which they were created for, and it is the worship of Allaah the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except so that they should worship Me alone.</span> </strong>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jinn</em> are a species of beings from the realms of the hidden and unseen, we do not see them, and they have the duty of performing worship and they are forbidden from committing <em>shirk </em>and from sin, just like the descendents of Aadam. However they differ from the descendents of Aadam in their created form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for with regard to commands and prohibitions, then they are just like the descendants of Aadam, they are bound by commands and prohibitions, and the <em>Jinn</em> are a species of beings from the world of the hidden and unseen, we do not see them, however they are present. And mankind, they are the descendants of Aadam. They are called <em>Al-Ins</em> because they are sociable with each other, they come together and they enjoy each others’ company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Jinn</em> are called <em>Jinn</em> from <em>Al-Ijtinaan, </em>which means the state of being hidden. And from it is <em>Al-Janeen</em> (the embryo) in the womb, because it is hidden, and it is said about a person <em>jannahul-layl</em> (the night covered him) when it covers him over, and it is also said <em>Al-Mijann</em> (a shield), that which is taken for protection in war for arrows and so on, so it covers the one who carries it. So <em>Al-Ijtinaan</em> and <em>Al-Janaan</em>, is something which is hidden and concealed. So the <em>Jinn</em> are hidden from us, we do not see them. And they are a species of beings who exist, whoever denies them then he is a disbeliever, since he is denying the truth of what Allaah and His Messenger have said, and denying the consensus of the Muslims, since Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has made clear that He did not create <em>Jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Him, not for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He did not create them in order for them to benefit Him or to harm Him nor in order to feel powerful because of them and not feel lowly nor in order to seek increase through them in place of having little because He is <em>Ghaniyy</em> (Independent), having no need of the creation, and He did not create them because of any need for them, He did not create them in order that they should provide for Him or that they should earn wealth for Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I do not want provision from them, and I do not want that they should feed Me. Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong. </strong></span>[51:57-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is not in need of the creation rather He created the <em>Jinn</em> and mankind for one thing alone and it is that they should worship Him, and He is not in need of their worship, rather they are in need of it, since if they worship Allaah, then He honours them and enters them into Paradise. So the benefit of worship returns to them, and the harmful effect of sins is upon them, as for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then He is not harmed by the obedience of the obedient one nor by the sin of the sinful one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> إِن تَكْفُرُوا أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you people disbelieve, you and everyone upon the earth together, then Allaah is the Independent One, free of all needs, the One deserving of all praise.</strong></span> [14:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not harmed by the sinning of the one who sins and He is not benefitted by the one who is obedient, rather this returns to the creation themselves. If they obey Him then they benefit, and if they disobey Him then they are harmed by sinning against Him.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone </strong></span>[51:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the meaning of, “they should worship”, is, “they should single Me out with all worship.”</span></strong><sup>16</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the meaning of <em>ya‘budoon</em> is <em>yuwa<u>hh</u>idoon</em>”: meaning they single Me out with all worship. So worship and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> have one and the same meaning. <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> can be explained to mean worship, and worship can be explained to mean <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and the meaning of these two is one. So this contains a refutation of those who explain <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> to be affirming that Allaah is the Creator, the Provider, the One who gives life, the One who gives death, the One who is in control of affairs. This is not the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> for which the creation were created, rather the creation were created for the tawheed of worship which is <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Uloohiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who only affirms <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah </em>(<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship), then he is not a <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) and he will not be from the people of Paradise, rather he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire, because he has not come with the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> which he was created for, and with worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Treatise :<br />
</strong><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em></strong><strong> (The Straight and True Religion), the Religious Way Followed by Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> </strong><strong>The Definition of <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إنَّ الحنيفيةَ: مِلَّةُ إبراهيمَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">That <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> (The straight and true religion) the religious way followed by Ibraaheem</span></strong><sup>13</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “That <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> the religious way followed by Ibraaheem”: meaning that which is obligatory that you should know and be aware of is that <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> is the religious way of Ibraaheem, and <em>Al-<u>H</u>anf</em> in the language means inclination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> is the religious way which turns away from <em>shirk</em> towards <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. And Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> was a <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, a Muslim. <em><u>H</u>aneef</em> meaning one who inclined away from <em>shirk</em> and turned away from it towards <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and making his religion purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَانِتًا لِّلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Ibraaheem was an <em>Ummah</em> </strong>(a teacher of good, and a leader followed upon guidance)<strong>, obedient to Allaah, <em><u>H</u>aneef</em> </strong>(upright upon the true religion of Islaam)<strong>, and he was not from those who associate others with Allaah </strong></span>[16:120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>al-<u>H</u>aneef</em> was one of the attributes of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> with the meaning that he turned away from <em>shirk </em>and inclined away from it totally in favour of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, turning totally towards <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>and making worship purely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then we revealed to you that you should follow the religious way of Ibraaheem the <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>  </strong>(the one who was upon the true religion, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> turning away from <em>shirk</em>)<strong>. </strong></span>[16:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the One free of all imperfections said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَٰكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but rather he was a <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, a Muslim, and he was not from those who associated others with Allaah </strong></span>[3:67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the tremendous characteristics of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihissalaam, </em>from them is that he was <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, and that his religious way is <em><u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em>, and it is the religion which is purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic which has no <em>shirk</em> in it. And Allaah commanded His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>that he should follow this religious way by His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۖ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then We revealed to you that you should follow the religious way of Ibraaheem who was <em><u>H</u>aneef</em>, and he was not from those who associated others with Allaah.</span> </strong>[16:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have been commanded likewise that we should follow the religious way of Ibraaheem ‘<em>alaihissalaam. </em>He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ اجْتَبَاكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ ۚ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ۚ هُوَ سَمَّاكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He has chosen you for His religion, and He has not placed any unbearable difficulty upon you in the religion. So follow the religious way of your forefather Ibraaheem. Allaah it is who has named you the Muslims</span></strong> [22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was the religion of all of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However because of the fact that Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>is the most excellent one of the Prophets after our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>because he encountered in the path of calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> such torment and trials as were not encountered by anyone else, and he had patience upon that. And because he was the father of the Prophets, because the Prophets who came after him, all of them were descendants of his <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam. </em>So therefore <em>Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em> was the religious way of all of the Prophets and it is the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the prohibition of <em>shirk </em>this was the religious way of all of the Messengers. However because Ibraaheem took notable stances for this religious way, it was ascribed to him and for those who came after him. And the Prophets all of them after him, they were upon the religious way of Ibraaheem, and it is the religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> making the religion purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this religious way which our Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was commanded to follow, and which we have been ordered to follow? It is obligatory upon us that we should be aware of it, because the Muslim, it is obligatory that he should be aware of whatever Allaah has made obligatory upon him, so that he can comply with it, and in order that he will not violate it. It is not sufficient to merely ascribe oneself to it without awareness, it is not sufficient to ascribe oneself to Islaam when he does not know what it is, and he does not know what are those things which nullify Islaam, and what are the religious duties of Islaam and the rulings of Islaam, and it is not sufficient to merely ascribe yourself to the religious way of Ibraaheem and you do not know what it is, and if you are asked about it you say, “I don’t know”. This is not permissible, it is obligatory that you are well aware of it so that you can proceed upon it upon clear insight and so that you do not violate anything from it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أنْ تعبدَ اللهَ وحدَهُ مخلصًا له الدِّين</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is that you worship Allaah alone, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him</strong></span><sup>14</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Is that you worship Allaah alone, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him”: this is the religious way of Ibraaheem, that you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him. That you combine two matters: worship and making the worship purely for Allaah. So whoever worships Allaah but does not make the whole of religion purely for Him, then his worship will be nothing at all. So whoever worships Allaah and fasts and performs the <em>Hajj</em> (pilgrimage) and prays and performs <em>‘Umrah</em>, and gives in voluntary charity and pays the <em>Zakaat </em>and does a great number of acts of obedience, however he does not do so making it purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, either because he does that for show or for repute, or because he mixed his deeds with something from <em>shirk, </em>such as calling upon other that Allaah, and calling for aid upon other than Allaah, and slaughtering for other than Allaah, then this person will not be <em>mukhli<u>s</u></em> one who is acting purely and sincerely for Allaah in his worship, rather he will be a <em>mushrik</em>, and he will not be upon the religious way of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of those who ascribe themselves to Islaam today fall into major <em>shirk</em>, into calling upon other than Allaah and worshipping the graves and the tombs and sacrificing for them and performing vows for them and making <em><u>t</u>awaaf</em> around them and seeking blessing from them and calling for aid to the dead and other than that, and they say that they are Muslims. Those people do not know the religious way of Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>which their Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was upon, they do not know of it or they know of it but then contradict it knowingly, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, and this is even worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religious way of Ibraheem does not accept <em>shirk</em> in any form and whoever mixes his actions with <em>shirk</em> then he is not upon the religious way of Ibraaheem, even if he ascribes himself to it and claims that he is a Muslim. So what is obligatory is that you should have awareness of the religious way of Ibraaheem and that you act upon it and that you adhere to it by worshipping Allaah making the whole of the religion purely and sincerely for Him, that there is not in your worship anything from lesser <em>shirk </em>or greater <em>shirk.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem ‘<em>alaihissalaam: Al-<u>H</u>aneefiyyah</em>, which turns away from <em>shirk</em> totally and turns to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> totally, that you worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that <em>masaajid</em> (the places of prayer) are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18] <strong><sup>9</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><u>S</u>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">ألا إن من كان قبلكم كانوا يتخذون القبور مساجد</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"> ألا فلا تتخذوا القبور مساجد فإني أﻧﻬاكم عن ذلك</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">لعنة الله على اليهود والنصارى اتخذوا قبور أنبيائهم مساجد</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the places where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<u>H</u>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لَّا تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْئًا وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْقَائِمِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><u>T</u>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration.</strong></span> [22:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا تَدْعُو</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not call upon or invoke</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<strong><em>tad‘oo</em></strong>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<strong><em>a<u>h</u>adan</em></strong>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah.</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the places of prayer are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الله لا يقبل إلا طيبا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Allah does not accept except what is good and pure</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show of, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[In this Audio]</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لاَ مَلَكٌ مُقَرَّبٌ وَلاَ نَبِيٌّ مُرْسَلٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</span>.</strong><sup>8</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</strong>”: the angel brought near – this is the most excellent ones from the angels such as Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, and the bearers of the Throne, and those around it, and the angels drawn close to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So despite the closeness of their place to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and their drawing close to Him with worship and their status with Allaah, if anyone were to associate them along with Allaah in worship then Allaah will not be pleased that an angel drawn close is associated with Him, nor any Prophet sent, such as Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>and ‘Eesaa and Noo<u>h</u> and Ibraaheem, those Messengers who are firmest in resolve. <span style="color:#ff0000;">He is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him even if it be one of the most excellent of the angels, even if it be one of the most excellent of mankind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is not pleased that anyone should be associated along with Him from the angels nor from the Messengers. So how about other than them from the beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people, so other than the angels and the Messengers it will be even more the case that Allaah is not pleased that they be associated with Him in worship. And this is a refutation of those people who claim that they take the righteous people and the beloved servants of Allaah as intercessors with Allaah in order to draw them closer to Allaah, just as the people of the days of ignorance used to say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We do not worship them except so that they should draw us closer to Allaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by interceding for us with Allaah)</span> [39:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they believed that those ones whom they took, they do not create and they do not give provision and they do not possess power over death nor life nor resurrection. Rather their intention was just to take them as intermediaries with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and therefore they directed some worship towards them to draw them closer to them, so they made sacrifices for the graves, and they made vows for the graves and they supplicated for aid and called upon the dead.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 09 : Part A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F428168643&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-is-not-pleased-that-anyone-else-should-be-associated-with-him-in-worship-of-him" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Perfect and Most High is not pleased that anyone else should be associated in worship with Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">المَسْأَلَةُ الثَّانِيَةُ: <span style="color:#000000;"><sup> </sup>أَنَّ اللهَ لاَ يَرْضَى أَنْ يُشْرَكَ مَعَهُ أَحَدٌ غَيرُهُ فِي عِبَادَتِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second matter: that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else should be associated with Him in worship of</strong> <strong>Him<sup>7</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is connected to the first matter, because the first one was an explanation of the obligation of worshipping Allaah, and of following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>and it is the meaning of the <em>shahaadatain </em>(two testifications), the meaning of the testification that, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, and the testification that, ‘Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah’. And the second matter is that worship, if it has <em>shirk</em> mixed with it, then it will not be accepted, because it is essential that worship is done purely for the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore whoever worships Allaah, and worships something else along with Him, then the worship of him is futile or null and void. Its presence is just the same as its absence, because worship will not benefit except with <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> (i.e. it is done purely for Allaah) and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So if it is mixed with <em>shirk</em> then it is corrupted, just as he the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it was revealed to you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Mu</span><span style="color:#008000;"><u>h</u></span><span style="color:#008000;">ammad) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and to those Messengers who came before you, that if you associate anything with Allaah then all your deeds will be rendered null and void, and then you would certainly be from the losers</span>. </strong>[39:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they committed <em>shirk</em> </strong>(associated anything along with Allaah) <strong>then whatever deeds they had done would be rendered null and void. </strong></span>[6:88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So worship is not called worship except along with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>just as the <em><u>s</u>alaah</em> (prayer) is not called <em><u>s</u>alaah</em> except along with purification. So if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with worship, it corrupts it and nullifies it, just as is the case with purification, if it is mixed with one of those things which break the <em>wu<u>d</u>oo’</em> then that corrupts it and nullifies it, and therefore Allaah in many <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan joins the command to worship Him and the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah and do not associate anything along with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ حُنَفَاءَ وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ الْقَيِّمَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they were not commanded except that they should worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him, upon the true religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, turning away from <em>shirk</em>. </strong></span>[98:5]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send before you a Messenger except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Me so therefore worship Me alone. </strong></span>[21:25]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None has the right to be worshipped except Me </strong></span>[21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains two matters: it contains a negation of <em>shirk</em> and it contains affirmation of worship for Allaah the Most High.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord commanded that you should not worship except Him </strong></span>[17:23]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a Messenger to every nation, commanding worship Allaah and avoid <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>aaghoot</em> </strong>(all false objects of worship)</span><strong>. </strong>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He joined between the worship of Allaah and avoiding the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot </em>(all the false objects of worship)<em>, </em>because the worship of Allaah will not be worship except with avoiding the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot, </em>and that is <em>shirk</em>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever rejects the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, and that Allaah alone has the right to be worshipped, then he has clung on to the firmest hand-hold which will never break</span> </strong>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So truly believing in Allaah is not sufficient except with rejection of <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>aaghoot, </em>otherwise the <em>mushrikoon</em> (the people of <em>shirk</em>) they believed in Allaah, however they associated others in worship with Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُم بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And most of them do not believe except that they associate others in their worship of Allaah</strong></span> [12:106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect makes it clear that they had belief in Allaah, however they corrupted it with <em>shirk</em> (association of others in worship of Allaah), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is meaning of the saying of the Shaikh (author), that whoever worshipped Allaah and obeyed the Messenger, then he may not associate anything in worship along with Allaah, because Allaah is not pleased that anything be associated with Him in His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said in that which he reported from his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">أنا أغنى الشركاء عن الشرك ، من عمل عملا أشرك معي فيه غيري تركته وشركه</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am the One having no need of any association of worship. Whoever does an action in which he associates anyone else along with Me, then I will abandon him and his <em>shirk</em>.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Huraira (<em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are people who pray the <em><u>s</u>alaah</em>, and they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they do that plentifully, and they fast and they perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. However, they make supplication to tombs, and they perform worship of Al-Hasan and Al-Husain and Al-Badawee and so-and-so and so-and-so, and they call for relief from the dead. Those people their worship is false and futile, because they have associated others with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, they have mixed worship with shirk so their deeds are futile and nullified, until they single out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with worship and they make worship purely for Him and they abandon the worship of everything else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they will be upon nothing, so it is obligatory to draw attention to this, because Allaah is not pleased that anything should be associated with Him in His worship, anyone no matter who it is. He the Perfect is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him no matter who it may be, so that no-one should say, “I take the beloved servants of Allaah, the righteous people and the good people as intercessors. I do not worship the idols and images as they used to do in the times of ignorance. I only take these ones as intercessors, I do not worship them.” So we say to him: This was the saying of the people in the times of ignorance, they took them as intercessors with Allaah because they were righteous people and beloved servants from the beloved servants of Allaah. But Allaah is not pleased with this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">[</b><b style="color:#993300;">Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s &#8220;Four Rules Regarding Shirk&#8221;]</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the <em>Haneefiyyah</em>, the religion of Ibraaheem is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him</strong></span>, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong><br />
</span>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one’s worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one’s worship – spoils it, invalidates one’s actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be achieved by knowing <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/islamic-book-study/the-four-rules-regarding-shirk-al-qawaaid-ul-arbaah/"><strong>Four Rules</strong></a> that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haneefiyyah</em> comes from <em>Haneef</em>, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed; <em>ahbata</em> (invalidates) nullifies; <em>maa doona dhaalik</em> (what is less than that) i.e. what is less than Shirk such as sins and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of <em>AlHaneefiyyah</em>, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face </strong>(i.e. himself)<strong> to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef </strong>(i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)<strong>?”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>: ‘Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he </strong>(i.e. Ibraaheem)<strong> was not from the polytheists.’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So its foundation is: Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong></span><br />
[Surah AdhDhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. Similarly, it is not truthful to call prayer by this name unless (ritual) purity accompanies it, since it is a condition for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this is not so, then if a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and nullifies it, just as an impure occurrence (hadath) causes the (ritual) purity to be spoiled and nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and it to return rejected to the one that performed it, as well as canceling out his deeds, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Had you committed Shirk, we would have surely cancelled out your deeds and you would have indeed been one of the losers”</strong></span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, as Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs </strong>(i.e. verses)<strong>, they are the inhabitants of the Hellfire, wherein they will reside forever – what an evil destination”</strong></span> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then at this point it will become clear that the most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, perhaps he may be set free from this satanic trap, which the Devil has set up in order to mislead the people away from their Lord and into committing Shirk with Allaah. This is the sin that Allaah does not forgive, as He says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship </strong>(i.e. Shirk)<strong>, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this cannot be accomplished unless one knows the following four rules, which Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem is to make one’s worship sincerely for Allaah alone and not mix partners into His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Shirk spoils one’s worship and causes a person’s good deeds to be invalidated. And the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem and what is the proof for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Explain the effect that Shirk has on worship and what it resembles. Give an example for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the most important thing the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn and know?</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 69 : Point 115</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Look into the stars sparingly, just enough to help you to know the times of the prayer. And turn away from whatever besides that, since it invites to apostasy </strong></span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: The Prophet (ﷺ) led us in the Fajr prayer at Hudaibiya after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)?</strong></span>&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;In this morning some of my slaves remained as true believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was due to the Blessings and the Mercy of Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but believes in that star.&#8217; &#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari] [Muhsin Khan&#8217;s Translation]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;These stars were only created for three purposes: Allah created them as adornment for the heaven </strong>(sky)<strong>, as missiles for the devils and as signs for navigation. Therefore, whoever seeks to interpret any other meanings for them other than these, then verily he has spoken with his own opinion, he has lost his portion and burdened himself with that which he has no knowledge of.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this statement.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 50: Points 84-86</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[84] And know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is His slave and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[85] And that whatever Allaah says is just as He said and nothing can contradict what He says and He is true to what He has said. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[86] And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-the-beginning-of-islaam-is-ash-shahaadataan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And you should know, O Muslim, O <em><u>t</u>aalib al-`ilm</em> (seeker of knowledge),” </strong>meaning you should be certain and understand clearly <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“that the beginning, the first part of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.” </strong></span>These two are the first pillar from the pillars of Islaam as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel in which Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Tell me about Islaam.” He said, “Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the Zakaat and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make the way to it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ash-Shahaadataan</em></strong> (the two testifications) are the first thing which mankind is to be called to. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah&#8221;. So if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property secure from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he (the Prophet) sent Mu`aa<u>dh</u> to Yemen, he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed you are going to a people from the People of the Scripture, so let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the first thing, which the people are to be called to because it is the entry point into the religion of Islaam. As for those who are lax about <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and do not give importance to it from the companions of the various calls and the present day methodologies utilising <em>da`wah,</em> then this is contrary to this tremendous fundamental principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is required with regard to the two testifications is not just to pronounce them upon the tongue. Rather, what is required is to state them upon the tongue whilst being aware of their meaning and to act in accordance with what they necessitate. However, whoever testifies that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah then it will be accepted from him. So if he is then upright upon it then he is a Muslim but if something appears from him, which contradicts them then he will be an apostate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification that <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is that you hold as your belief in your heart and that you state upon your tongue and you affirm and you acknowledge that none is deserving of worship (<em>ibaadah)</em> except for Allaah and that everything that is worshipped besides Him is false and futile. And worship of it is false and futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the one who is truly deserving of worship and those whom they worship and invoke besides Him, that is false and futile. And Allaah is the Most High and Exalted One, the Incomparably Great One.</strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah</em> 62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification <em>Anna Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em>; that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, is that you acknowledge outwardly and inwardly that he is the Messenger of Allaah. As for a person who states it upon his tongue but he does not acknowledge his messengership inwardly then this one is a <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the hypocrites come to you </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, they say, “We testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.” And Allaah knows that you indeed are His Messenger and Allaah testifies that the hypocrites are certainly liars in their testifying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Munaafiqoon (63), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p><strong> يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They say with their mouths that which is not in their hearts.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of the testification that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah; <em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em> is, in summary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded and to attest to the truth of whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah should not be worshipped except with that which He legislated.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded; </strong>so if the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded a matter then you must comply with it.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not for a believing man nor for a believing woman when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice with regard to their affair. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed with a clear straying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah</em> 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To attest to the truth of whatever he informed of;</strong> he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about some affairs of the <em>ghaib</em> (the hidden and the unseen) of the past and the future. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to be believed regarding whatever he informed of and he did not speak from desires.</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is just revelation sent to him.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informing about something is something true and something certain. No doubt can come upon it if it is authentic from him <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the phrase: <strong>“and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited,” </strong>avoiding whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade and prohibited, that is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and whatever he forbids you from, then desist and fear and be dutiful to Allaah. Indeed Allaah is severe in punishment. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that Allaah is not to be worshipped except with that which He legislated.” </strong>Whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> legislated; conveying it from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And this negates innovations and newly introduced affairs and baseless practices, which the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not command. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever does an action, which our affair is not in accordance with then it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced affairs.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa· </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Caliphs)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> who come after me. Cling onto it and bite upon it with your pre-molar teeth. And beware of the newly introduced affairs for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> and every innovation is a going astray</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And every <em>`ibaadah</em> (worship), which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not legislate then it is <em>baatilah</em> (false and futile) and there will be no reward in doing it. Rather, there will be sin in it because it is a <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) and innovation takes a person further away from Allaah and will not draw him closer to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.” </strong></span>This is the first pillar and it is the entrance. Then after it comes the <em><u>S</u>alaah</em> (prayer) then after it comes the <em>Zakaat</em> then fasting <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan</em> then <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to Allaah’s sacred house, then the rest of the duties and laws of the religion. All of them follow on from the two testifications; the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And that whatever Allaah said then it is just as He said and none can contradict what He has said and He is true to what He has said.”</span> </strong>Whatever Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said then it is just as He has said. No doubt can ever come upon it. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حَدِيثًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer in speech than Allaah. </span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 87)</span></p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ قِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer than Allaah in saying.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 122)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: no-one is truer than Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And if Allaah, the Perfect makes a promise (<em>wa`d)</em> then He does not break it.</p>
<p><strong>وَعْدَ اللَّهِ ۖ لَا يُخْلِفُ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The promise of Allaah, it is a promise of Allaah, Allaah does not break His promises. However, most of mankind do not know that Allaah will certainly carry out His promise. </strong></span>(Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when He makes a promise then He does not break His promise. And if He <em>tawa`adah</em> (threatens) something then He may pardon, He the Perfect and Most High. So there is a difference between <em>al-wa`d</em> (promises) and <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (threats). So <em>al-wa`d</em> (the promise), He never breaks a promise. And as for <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (a threat) that He has made; <em>al-wa`eed</em> (a threat) then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High may pardon and overlook and may not carry out the <em>wa`eed</em> (threat) as a mercy from Him, He, the Perfect, and as a favour from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all of the revealed laws.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws, which Allaah sent down to His Messengers, all of them, in general with regard to those, which have been left unspecified and specifically with regard to those that have been mentioned specifically.</p>
<p><strong>قُولُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ النَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “We truly believe in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and whatever the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between any of them and we submit as Muslims to Him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 136)</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “We have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(we truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and to the Prophets from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between them and we are Muslims submitting to Him.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we have <em>eemaan</em> (we truly believe) in all of the divine laws sent down and we truly believe that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High legislates for each time whatever is suitable for it and then He abrogates that with another revealed law, which is suitable for those who come after them. So, when Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent, he came with a revealed law, which was firmly grounded and will remain until the Hour is established. It will not be abrogated and it will never be changed. It is suitable for every time and place.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 76</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is not permissible to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>(sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims, whether righteous or sinful in matters of the religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> So, whoever withholds it then he has acted deceitfully towards the Muslims and whoever acts deceitfully towards the Muslims then he has acted deceitfully towards the religion, and whoever acts deceitfully towards the religion then he has shown treachery towards Allaah, His Messenger and the believers.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> “<strong>And it is not permissible for you to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims whether they be righteous or sinful,” </strong></span><em>An-<strong>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong></em> (sincerity) is to be pure and free of <strong><em>ghish</em> </strong>(deceit) and a thing that is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em>; a thing that has its quality of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>, it is a thing that is <em>khaali<u>s</u></em> (pure). So, the believer, it is obligatory that he should be <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (sincere); meaning that he should be pure and free of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaq</em> and he should be pure and free of <em>ghish</em> (deceptiveness) and he should be pure and free of <em>khadee`ah</em> (cheating). His outward aspect and his inward aspect should be just the same with regard to truthfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is the religion just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion is an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> <strong>(sincerity), the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity; an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah. We said, ‘Towards whom O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Towards Allaah and towards His Book and towards His Messenger and towards the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it (<em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>) here is that a person is free of every blameworthy characteristic and that he adorns himself with all the noble and virtuous manners and characteristics. So, the man who is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (has this quality of sincerity) is the one who is not deceptive, does not have any <em>ghish</em> (deceptive) towards anyone. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us is not from us.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the opposite of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is <strong><em>al-ghish</em></strong> (deceptiveness). And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> repeated his saying <em>ad-deenun</em> <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (the religion is sincerity) three times for emphasis and to stress its importance and he limited the religion; all of it to being <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>An-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) towards Allaah</strong> and His Messenger; this is with regard to <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). So, a person will not be a Muslim unless his `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is sound and is free of <em>shirk</em> and his actions are free of innovations (<em>bid`ah)</em> and he is one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this person, he is the one who is <strong><em>an-naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em></strong> (one who is sincere) towards Allaah and His Messenger, i.e the one whose deeds are free of <em>shirk</em> and free of innovations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sincerity towards the Messenger</strong> <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to truly believe; to have <em>eemaan</em> in his Messengership, and to love him, and to respect, and honour him <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam,</em> and to take him as an example to follow, and to give precedence to his saying over the saying of everyone, and to leave off innovations and new introductions, which are something that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against, and to believe him regarding whatever he informed about regarding things of the unseen of the past and the future, and to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade. This is sincerity towards the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, <strong><em>“…and towards His Book…”</em></strong> the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is the Qur&#8217;aan such that you have <em>eemaan</em> that it is the speech of Allaah sent down; not created, it is not the speech of anyone else as is said by the people of misguidance; and that you learn it, and teach it, and that you act upon it, and that you acquire understanding of its meanings, and that you reflect upon it. This is sincerity towards the Book of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High; learning, and teaching, and understanding, and acquiring knowledge of it, and acting upon it. And likewise, from sincerity towards the Book of Allaah is to be plentiful in its recitation and not to be neglectful with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity)<strong><em> “…towards the rulers of the Muslims…”</em></strong> they are those who are in charge of the affairs, those in authority, that you obey them in that which is not disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And that you do not remove your hand from obedience, and that you do not rebel against them, and that you do not seek out their mistakes and their hidden faults and expose them to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity (<em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah)</em> towards them is that if you have knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> and you have the ability to sincerely advise them that you do so personally between yourself and them; you cause the advice to reach them and inform them about mistakes, which occur from them or from their subjects, you let them know about that but you do not speak about them in gatherings, for this will be a case of <em>ghish</em> (treachery). So, <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is that you convey sincere advice from yourself to them. This is from sincerity towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from sincerity towards the person in authority is to carry out the duty that he puts you in charge of carrying out, whether it is a <em>wa<u>z</u>eefah</em> (duty or a post) or being placed in charge of something or other than that from the affairs of the religion and the worldly life, that you carry the duty out which the one in authority has entrusted you with in the best manner and that you do not miss anything of it out and if you see any deficiencies then you inform the one in authority between yourself and him. You inform him of the deficiencies so that he can remedy it. This is sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity towards those in authority is to make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them that they be rectified since if they are sound and rectified, the subjects will be sound and rectified and that you make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them. So, if you see a man who is a student of knowledge who does not make supplication for them or who criticises making supplication for them then you should know that he is treacherous (<em>ghaash)</em> and he is not one who is sincere towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincerity<strong><em> “…towards the common Muslims,” </em></strong>is that you direct them to what is correct; and you warn them against errors, and that you command the good and forbid the evil, and that you teach the one who is ignorant, and that you remind the person who is heedless, and that you love for him the good that you love for yourself, and to have compassion for the poor person, and you give charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> for the needy. This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, that he gives good advice to the person who consults him and he guards secrets for one who trusts him regarding something and to safeguard things which are entrusted with you. He should be sincere from all aspects. And sincerity is with regard to buying and selling such that he does not deceive and does not trick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) in brief. So, whoever is not like that then he is treacherous and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in disconnected form; meaning in a chapter heading, you’ll find it there in the <em>Book of Eemaan</em>; the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, chapter 42.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s reported in connected form by Imaam Muslim (55) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Tameem ad-Daari <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Imaam Muslim does not have the repetition of his saying (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>): <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)…</span><strong>”. </strong>Meaning; there in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, it only occurs once that he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)</span>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, that occurs being reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and others and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>a<u>s</u>an, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, likewise, declared it with the addition there as being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Muslim (101) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and also reported by Muslim (102 ) with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives then he is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 1<sup>st</sup> wording in Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2<sup>nd</sup> wording reported by Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to this first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong> </strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (the religion is sincerity) and then when they asked, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “firstly, lillaah (towards Allaah).”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “By obedience to Him and not disobeying Him and by implementing `<em>Uboodiyyalahum</em> (servitude towards Him) and by establishing His Tawheed with regard to His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and with regard to His `<em>Uloohiyyah</em> (His sole right to all worship) and with regard to His names and attributes and that you seek by performance of your deeds His face &amp; that you are sincere in your deeds, which you carry out. So, you are sincere in them and true in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> mentioned more or less the same point. He added a point also, he had a no. of points, from them was,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Having love for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and also making supplication for; <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. </em>And not writing just it&#8217;s abbreviated forms like  SAW, SAAW, or SAAS. We seeks Allaah’s refuge from this abridging  of <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger,  as this is from the <em>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Shi`a</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah such that there is no <em>shirk</em> in it for Allaah will not accept any action except that which is done purely and sincerely for His Face, having no <em>shirk</em> in it nor association of others along with Him in it. And this is one of the <strong>two conditions</strong> for an action to be acceptable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second condition</strong> is <em>al-mutaaba`ah</em> (following the example of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in doing that action) and acting upon the Sunnah such that the action is in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> such that it does not contain <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) because Allaah does not accept innovation. Rather, He punishes for them even if a person exhausted himself in doing deeds. If he did not make the deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah, then they will be scattered dust. And if a person exhausted himself in doing a deed which is not in conformity with the Sunnah then it will be rejected. And it will not be accepted except along with these two conditions that it is done purely and sincerely for Allaah alone and it’s done in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:111</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">And they (the People of the Book) said no-one will enter Paradise except for one who is a Jew or a Christian. That is their false hope. Say, “Bring your proof if you are speaking the truth.” </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">111)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, this is to refute what they are negating.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:112</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rather it will be entered by whoever submits his face to Allaah and he is a doer of good then his reward will be with his Lord and there will be no fear upon them nor will they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever submits his face to Allaah,” </strong>meaning he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He is a doer of good,” </strong>meaning one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and this applies to everyone, the Jews and the Christians and the rest of the world, it must be with these two conditions; with purity and sincerity for Allaah and with following the Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Moosaa, the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, the strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We see that his call was directed to <em>tawheed</em> and carried the lights of guidance and wisdom. Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Pharaoh were also people of <em>shirk</em> and idol-worship without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of <em>tawheed</em>, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Has not the story of Moosaa come to you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, ‘Remain where you are for I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring a fire-brand from it or find someone who can show us the way.’ So when Moosaa came to the fire his Lord called him, ‘O Moosaa, I am your Lord. Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of <em>Tuwaa</em>. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving <em>da’wah</em> and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also supported him with his brother Haaroon in order for the proof to be established to the utmost, and He taught them to use gentleness and mildness in <em>da’wah</em> since that is the best way to attain the guidance of those whom Allaah wishes to guide:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go both of you to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed beyond all bounds, and speak mildly with him that he might accept admonition and fear and be obedient to his Lord.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they carried out the order of their Lord and called him to Allaah, hoping for him to be guided and purified, so that he should be one of those who fear Allaah and fear and beware of the evil consequences of <em>shirk</em> and oppression. But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and let their women live, and will have full power over them.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what was the sin of Moosaa and his people in the view of these criminals? No crime except that they called to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when no hope that the Pharaoh and his people would believe remained, and the suffering which the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> were subjected to increased in severity, the sole request which Moosaa made to the Pharaoh was that he should allow the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> the freedom to leave the land of Egypt and emigrate to wherever Allaah willed that they should go, in order to save them from the torment inflicted upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So go to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘We are the Messengers sent by your Lord, to order you to free the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>. So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a sublime call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors. Including clear lessons for those who make their call purely seeking the Face of Allaah and desire to rectify mankind and to turn to their Lord, and for them to be guided to His Straight Path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Importance of <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah<br />
</em>(Singling out Allaah with all Worship)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will discuss <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to worship (<em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah) </em>and its importance because of two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Firstly</span></strong>, that it is the most important part of the call of the Messengers presented to us in the Qur’aan, and because it was the reason for the continual struggle between them and their enemies, the proud and haughty, and the obstinate, in every nation. It has continued as the reason for conflict until this day, and perhaps it will continue as such until the Day of Resurrection, as a trial and test for the inheritors of the Messengers, and in order to raise their station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span></strong>, the most severe and dangerous deviation afflicting the Muslims in the east and the west is with regard to it, and this affects the majority of the ignorant amongst the Muslims and many of those who are educated and those who associate themselves with knowledge. So we will begin by presenting the calls of the Prophets in general, and then present the call of some of them in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah. So from them there were those whom Allaah guided to His religion, and there were those who were unbelievers for whom misguidance was ordained. So travel through the land and see the destruction that befell those who denied the Messengers and disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so make all of your worship purely for Him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says after mentioning a number of stories of the Prophets, <em>alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam:</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O Messengers, eat from the food which Allaah has made lawful, and do correct and righteous deeds. Indeed, I am fully aware of whatever you do. Indeed this religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord so keep yourselves safe from My punishment by obeying Me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, “Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Qataadah and Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,  which means, <strong>‘Your religion is one.’</strong>”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Then the meaning of these two <em>Aayaat </em>occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em> in his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   saying, <strong><em>“I am the closest of the people to &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers, their mothers are different, but their religion is one.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allaah, the Most High, says about the Messengers who were firmest in determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adham</em>), <em>alayhimus-salaatu was -salaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Your Lord prescribed for you O people, the same religion which He prescribed for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> ), and which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, and Moosaa, and ’Eesaa, that you should establish the religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it. It is intolerable to the polytheists that you call them to sincerely worship Allaah alone and reject worship of all else besides Him. But Allaah chooses for His religion whomever He pleases and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience, to act in obedience to Him, and to follow the guidance with which He sent His Messenger.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of all the Prophets, and at the head of them the Messengers who were firmest in determination. So the Prophets who numbered <strong>one hundred and twenty four thousand</strong> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> followed a single methodology in their call, and began from a single starting point which is <em>tawheed</em>, the greatest issue and most important principle which they conveyed to all mankind, throughout the ages and despite their varying societies, lands and times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof that this is the single way which must be followed in calling the people to Allaah, and it is something laid down by Allaah to be followed by all of His Prophets and their true and sincere followers. It is not permissible to change or replace it, nor to turn away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examples From the Calls of Some of the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, has informed us about some of the individuals from the greater Prophets, and how they faced their people. We see that all of them proceeded upon the universal way laid down for them by Allaah and they followed the methodology established for all of them by Allaah. Not a single one of them is at variance with it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And We sent Nooh to his people saying, ‘I am a clear warner sent to you, that you should worship none besides Allaah. Indeed, if you do not make all your worship purely for Him I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.’ The chiefs of the disbelievers amongst his people said, ‘We see that you are but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by the lowest of the people, in what is apparent to us. Nor do we see that you have any excellence over us, rather we think that you are a liar.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="color:#008000;">“And to ’Aad We sent Hood, saying, ‘O my people worship Allaah, making all of your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshipped by you. Will you not fear your Lord?’ The leaders of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, ‘We see you upon error </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(due to your abandonment of our religion and worship of our gods)</span><strong style="color:#008000;"> and we think that you are a liar </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in claiming to be a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds).</span><strong style="color:#008000;">’ He said, ‘O my People, I am not upon error, I am indeed a Messenger sent by the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Message of my Lord and am sincere in my advice and faithful to my trust. Do you wonder that Allaah should send admonition for you through a man from amongst you, warning you of Allaah’s punishment and to fear Him? And remember the blessings of Allaah upon you in that He made you successors to the people of Nooh </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(after drowning them for their unbelief and denial of their Messenger)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and He increased you in height and size. So remember the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>favours</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> bestowed upon you by Allaah, so that you may be successful.’ They said, ‘Do you come to us warning us of punishment from Allaah for that which we practise as religion, so that we should instead worship Allaah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? We will not do that, so bring us the punishment which you threaten us with if you are truthful.’ He said, ‘Allaah’s punishment and wrath have become unavoidable for you. Do you dispute with me about mere idols which you and your fathers have given names to, things which can neither bring harm nor benefit, and Allaah has given no proof or excuse for their worship? Then wait for Allaah’s judgement between us, I too shall wait.’ So We saved Hood and those with him through Our Mercy </b><span style="color:#008000;">(due to their eemaan and their worship of Allaah alone)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and we annihilated those who rejected Our signs and were not Believers.”</b><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of the Messengers, all of them followed this methodology in their <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah: they called first to the <em>tawheed </em>of Allaah, and that He alone must be singled out with all worship. Then their people opposed them because of this, except those whom Allaah guided, facing them with mockery, charging them with being liars and seeking to ridicule them. As Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Many Prophets were sent to the earlier peoples, and no Prophet came to them except that the people met him with mockery.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more severe and hurtful to lofty believing souls than accusations of falsehood, ridicule and mockery. These things are more hurtful to them than being struck with swords and imprisonment and punishment. This fact is mentioned by the Arab poet who said, “<strong>Being harmed by close relatives is more painful to the soul than being struck with a sharpened sword</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">’Aa’ishah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhaa, </em>asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Has there been a day more severe upon you than the Day of Uhud?” So he said, “Your tribe has troubled me greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of ’Aqabah when I presented myself to ’Abd Yaaleel ibn ’Abd Kulaal and he didn&#8217;t respond as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with sorrow and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha’aalib.</em><a style="color:#333399;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><em> I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me, then I looked and saw Jibreel in it, and he called me saying, ‘Allaah has heard what your people said to you and their reply, and Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you, for you to order him to do whatever you wish.’ So the Angel of the mountains called me and greeted me with salaam and then said, ‘O Muhammad, Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you for you to order me as you wish. So what do you wish?’ So Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, “No, rather I hope that from their offspring will come those who will worship Allaah alone and not worship anything else besides Him.”</em></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> clearly shows the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and his perseverance in that, and his mildness with his people. See how he was patient with them and asked for them to be spared from destruction which would have wiped them out. He instead hoped for good from Allaah, and hoped that from their offspring would come those who worshipped Allaah alone, not worshipping anything besides Him. Indeed what a noble and lofty goal, which is not realized except by those who taste the blessing of <em>tawheed</em> and know its station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of <em>Seerah</em><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> detail some of the answers given by those who mocked him and their scornful stance when he invited them to Islaam. They mention that he went to a number of the nobles and leaders of the tribe of Thaqeef, and they were three brothers, ’Abd Yaleel, Mas&#8217;ood and Habeeb&#8230; and he sat with them and called them to Allaah and asked them to support Islaam and stand with him against those of his people who opposed him. So one of them said, “If it is actually true that Allaah has sent you, then He is tearing down the covering of the Ka’bah.” The second said, “Could Allaah not find anyone to send but you?” The third said, “By Allaah, I will never speak with you. If you are truly a Messenger from Allaah as you claim, then you are more serious than to have me reply to your words, and if you are lying against Allaah then it is not proper that I should ever speak to you.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   left having despaired of good from Thaqeef.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we see from the <em>hadeeth</em> and the stroy is that mockery and scorn and harm caused by the foolish idolaters was more severe to the Prophets than any other trouble, even more so than the fierce battles in which lives are spent and the blood of their pure companions is shed. Indeed on the Day of Uhud more than seventy Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   were martyred.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Amongst them: Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and Hamzah ibn ’Abdil- Muttalib<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   was injured in the face and his incisor was broken.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> He also suffered along with his Companions at the hands of the hypocrites, and suffered great harm and hardship before that in Makkah, and at Badr and other battles. Yet despite all of this, the severest trouble which he faced was on the Day of Taa’if because of the mockery and contempt which he faced to such a degree that it is unbearable for pure souls. Furthermore Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said, <em>“<strong>Those who suffered the severest trials are the Prophets, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them after that.</strong>”</em><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are most like them, and then those who are next closest are those who proceed upon their methodology in calling to Allaah, and called to what they called to, i.e. to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and that He is to be singled out with all worship, and to rejection of all <em>shirk</em> (attribution of any form or part of worship to anyone besides Allaah). Such people will suffer similar harm and trials as suffered by the Prophets who are their example. It is because of this fact that you see many of the callers departing away from this difficult methodology, and this rugged path, since the caller who follows it will have to face opposition from his mother, his father, his brother, his friends and those whom he loves. He will be opposed by the society which will treat him as an enemy and seek to mock and harm him. So many callers divert their attention to other aspects of Islaam which do have their place, and are not denied by anyone who truly believes in Allaah, except that those aspects do not involve that difficulty and hardship and do not bring about mockery and harm particularly in Islamic societies. This is because the majority of the people of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam are willing to gather around these type of callers, and they throw praise and honour upon them instead of mockery and harm, unless they pose a threat to the rulers and are a danger to their positions, in which case they suppress them brutally. For example political parties which oppose the rulers and threaten to dethrone them. In such a case the rulers will show no love to relatives or friends, Muslims or disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in any case we say to those callers: no matter how much noise they make, and no matter how high they raise their voices in the name of Islaam, restrain yourselves because you have left the way prescribed by Allaah and His Straight Path, upon which the Prophets and their followers proceeded in calling to <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making the religion purely for Him. So no matter how much you speak and raise your voices in the name of Islaam, you are still deviating from the methodology of the Prophets which was laid down by Allaah. No matter how much effort you expend, and how much you manage to extend your <em>da’wah</em> and your own methodology, you are still preoccupying yourselves with the means to the exclusion of the goal. Then what use are the means<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> if they merely harm the goal, and they themselves grow at its expense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed woe to those callers who obstinately persist upon the methodologies which they themselves have innovated, those who fight against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, beneath dazzling banners and slogans which captivate the simple minded and those ignorant of the methodology and way of the Prophets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   suffered the worst forms of torture because of their adherence to the correct <em>‘aqeedah, </em>and their making all worship purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and their rejection of <em>shirk</em> and <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “The first people to openly proclaim their Islaam were seven: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Aboo Bakr, ’Ammaar and his mother Sumayyah, Suhayb, Bilaal and al-Miqdaad. So as for Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Allaah gave him protection through his uncle Aboo Taalib. As for Aboo Bakr, Allaah gave him protection through his people. But as for the rest of them, the <em>Mushriks</em> would take hold of them and dress them in iron armour and place them to scorch and roast in the sun. There was not one of them except that they responded to them except Bilaal, for his soul became as nothing to him for Allaah’s sake, and his people had no respect for him. So they gave him to the children who used to drag him around the streets of Makkah and he would say repeatedly, ‘<strong>(He who has the right to worship is) One, One.</strong>’”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Seerah</em> of Ibn Hishaam [2] there occurs: ’Umayyah ibn Khalf used to take him (Bilaal) out in the midday heat of the sun, and throw him down upon his back, on the ground of the flat valley bed of Makkah, and he would order for a large rock to be placed on his chest. Then he would say, “By Allaah, you will stay like this until you die, unless you disbelieve in Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   and you worship <em>al-Laat</em> and <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>.” So he would say, whilst he was in that condition, “<strong>(He who alone has the right to worship is) One, One</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sumayyah was tortured until death because of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em> not becasue she was a political leader. So from Mujaahid who said, “<strong>The first martyr in Islaam was Sumayyah the mother of ’Ammaar. Aboo Jahl thrust a spear into her abdomen.</strong>”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa&#8217;d said, “She accepted Islaam early on in Makkah and she was one of those who was tortured to force them to abandon their religion. But she bore and endured it until Aboo Jahl came to her and thrust a spear into her abdomen and she died.”[4]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Haakim in <em>al-Mustadrak </em>(3/284) and he declared it <em>saheeh</em> and adh-Dhahabee mentioned it in <em>Siyar A’laamin-Nubalaa</em> (1/348) and he said, “It has a <em>saheeh</em> chain of narration&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yoosuf (عليه السلام)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one.[1] About whom Allaah sent down a long <em>Soorah</em> relating his noble life to us, and its stages, from his childhood to his death, and how his circumstances changed, and the difficulties that he faced, and how he faced everything with the Strength of Prophethood and his patient perseverance, wisdom and mildness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>saw the corrupt outlook of the Pharaohs in Egypt and their oppression, and he knew the beliefs of the nation amongst whom he lived. He knew the corruption of their beliefs and their idolatry, which led them to take idols and cattle as gods to worship besides Allaah. The stroy of this noble Prophet, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>is long, and from it, we will examine the story of his imprisonment and his <em>da’wah</em> at that time. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And two young men entered the prison along with him. One of them said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was pressing grapes,’ and the other one said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread upon my head and birds were eating from it.’ ‘Inform us of the interpretation of this for indeed we see that you are one of the doers of good.’ He said, ‘No food will come to you to eat except that I will inform you about it fully before it comes to you. This is from the knowledge which my Lord has taught me as I have remained free of the religion of a people who do not believe in the oneness of Allaah and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. Rather I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob. It is not fitting that we should worship anything else along with Allaah. This is from Allaah’s favour upon us and upon the people, yet most of the people do not give thanks for Allaah’s favours. O my two companions in the prison, is it better that you worship many different lords, or that you worship only Allaah, the One, Who subdues and has full power over everything? You do not worship besides Allaah except idols which you call gods, which you and your forefathers give names to, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. Authority is for Allaah alone. He ordered that you worship none but Him, that is the Straight and true religion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble Prophet, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>lived in their palaces and was therefore well aware of the corruption of their administration and their rulers. He experienced at first hand their plots, their oppression, their unjust persecution and imprisonment by them. Furthermore he lived amongst an idolatrous nation who worshipped idols, cattle and stars. So where was correction to begin? What was the starting point?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Did he begin calling to Allaah, whilst he was wrongfully imprisoned along with others who were oppressed like him, by inciting them and rousing them against the despotic and tyrant rulers? This would be without a doubt a political response, and was an opportunity open to him. Or did he begin his call from the starting point adopted by his noble forefathers, and at the head of them Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah and the <em>Imaam</em> of the call to <em>tawheed</em>; which was the starting point for all the Messengers of Allaah? There is no doubt that the single way of correction and rectification in every time and place is the way of calling to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em> and <em>tawheed</em> and that all worship should be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Yoosuf began from this starting point, following his noble fathers, proud of their <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and deriding and exposing the foolishness of the idolaters and their practice of taking idols, cattle and stars as lords to be worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after clearly explaining this, and openly calling to <em>tawheed</em> and to rejection of <em>shirk</em>, he emphasised his call and his argument by his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Authority and command is for Allaah alone.”</strong>[3], [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he explained this authority and command to mean the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and that He alone is to be worshipped:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“&#8230;That is the Straight and true reigion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>attained the highest position in this state[6] whilst calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and establishing the clear proofs for his call and his Prophethood. Allaah, the Most High, says, in explanation of this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The king of Egypt said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my personal servant.’ So when he spoke to Yoosuf, he said, ‘Verily, this day you have with us a position of rank and full trust.’ He said, ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses and wealth of the land, indeed I will guard them faithfully and with full knowledge.’”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said, giving thanks to his Lord and Protector,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, You have bestowed upon me something of dominion and have taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Lord and Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore Allaah says in explanation of his <em>da’wah</em>, upon the tongue of the Believer from the family of the Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Yoosuf came to you previously (before Moosaa) with clear signs yet you have not ceased doubting about what he came to you with. Until when he died you said, ‘Allaah will not send any Messenger after him.’ This is the state of those whom Allaah leads astray, those who are disbelievers in Him and doubt the truthfulness of the Messengers.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the knowledge to be learned from the life-story of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>which is presented to us in those noble <em>Aayaat</em> is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> is something very essential. Furthermore there is to be no leniency or relaxation in fighting against <em>shirk</em>, it is not permissible to keep silent about it, whatever the circumstances of the caller to Allaah; rather it is not permissible for any Muslim to ever accept it or be relaxed about it. So this shows the high station of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and its importance with Allaah, and with His Prophets and His Messenger. It also shows the very great difference and the distance between it and the details of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for the Muslim, particularly the caller, to take up any position which violates his <em>‘aqeedah</em> or is contrary to it, or that he is a fortune-teller, those who are <em>Mushriks</em>, or that he is a custodian of their idols. If he does any of this then he is one of the misguided <em>Mushriks.</em> With regard to the legislative aspect, if the Islamic state is established, it must apply the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah, otherwise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The unbelief (<em>kufr</em>) here is explained in detail by the scholars of Islaam, from the Companions and others, that it may be major <em>Kufr</em>, when the person disdains the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and declares it lawful to judge by something else, and it may be lesser <em>Kufr</em> (i.e., that which does not take a person out of Islaam) when he does not declare it lawful to judge by other than it, but gives in to his desires and because of that judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However when the Islamic state has not been established, then Allaah does not a burden a soul with more than it is capable of. So the Muslim may take up a position in a non-Muslim state with the condition that he establishes justice, and that he does not obey them ina matter which involves disobedience to Allaah, and does not judge by other than what Allaah sent down. This was what the Prophet of Allaah, Yoosuf, did. He took up a position as a deputy for a unbelieving king, and he did not judge according to his laws:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He could not have taken and kept his brother according to the king’s law.”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he established justice between the subjects and called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah. So this contains a decisive reply to those who give little importance to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>Tahweed</em>. Those who gloss over and accomodate when it comes to the <em>shirk</em> which has filled the world, and they regard the callers to <em>tawheed</em> and the enemies of <em>shirk</em> with contempt and scorn. They turn up their noses and are too proud to ‘lower’ themselves to the level of the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, and they are very wily and astute concerning political affairs, but nothing is more burdensome and disagreeable to their hearing and their hearts than listening to or saying a word regarding <em>tawheed</em> or <em>shirk.</em> These types of callers have caused themselves to fall into a deep abyss, whilst they think that they have reached the highest peaks. Can a people ever prosper whose stance with regard to the call of the Prophets is like this, unless they sincerely repent to Allaah from what they are upon?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said, “<strong>The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one: Yoosuf the son of Ya’qoob, the son of Ishaaq, the son of Ibraaheem, </strong><em><strong>’alayhis-salaam.</strong>” </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/596), and Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/96), and also the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Hurairah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about the noblest of the people, so he said, <em>“Those most pious and obedient to Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then the noblest of the people is Yoosuf, the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then is it about the origins of the Arabs that you ask? Then the people are of various origins. The best of them in the times of ignorance are the best of them in Islaam when they attain knowledge and understanding in the religion.”</em> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/597).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em>Aayah</em> is one of the basic principles from the principles of <em>tawheed</em>, as Allaah has explained upon the tongue of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam. </em>What is most unfortunate is that you see that many of the political reformers have explained it in a way that is far removed from its primary meaning, that all worship is to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and have instead explained it to have a political meaning, which is establishment of the state which they claim will establish Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> upon the earth as His deputies/vicegerents. Then they go beyond bounds in this direction till they cause the people to forget the principal meaning of the <em>Aayah</em>, and they understand nothing from it except this new meaning, and there is no action and no ability except by the will of Allaah. They do the same with all or most of the <em>Aayaat</em> of <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah, </em>said in <em>al-Hisbah</em> (p.7), “Likewise Yoosuf the truthful and honest, was a minister for the Pharaoh of Egypt, and he and his people were <em>mushriks</em>. So Yoosuf performed whatever justice and good he was able to and called them as far as possible to correct <em>eemaan</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Father of the Prophets and the Leader of those who worship Allaah alone, upon the true religion, Ibraaheem, the Chosen and Beloved Friend of Allaah (<em>Khaleelullaah</em>), who was such that Allaah ordered the best of the Messengers and the final Prophet, and his <em>ummah</em>, to emulate him, to take his call as an example, and to follow his way and methodolgy.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father Aazar, ‘Will you take idols for worship? Indeed I see that you and those who worship idols along with you are upon clear error.’ Likewise We showed Ibraaheem the heavens and the earth (and how they are a proof that the Creator alone should be worshipped), so that he should be one of those who have Faith with certainty. So when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star and said, (as an argument to show his people the error of worshipping anything besides Allaah), ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set, he said, ‘I do not love that which passes away.’ Then when he saw the moon rising up he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set he said, ‘If my Lord did not keep me firm upon the guidance then I would surely be one of the misguided.’ Then when he saw the sun, he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?! This is greater than the others.’ Then when it set he said, ‘O my people, I am free from all that you associate as partners in worship with Allaah. Indeed I have turned my face in worship to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, making all worship purely for Him, and I am not from those who worship anything besides Allaah.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent, vigorous and incessant call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all of religion purely for Him, and to the elimination and rejection of <em>shirk</em>. It begins with the family and extends to the nations, waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and the idols and shaking the very foundations of attribution of any worship to the stars. So the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah proceeded upon the soundest way in debating and arguing in order to establish Allaah’s Proof and to refute <em>shirk</em> and to show its fallacy and reject the doubts used to support it. So his use of the word ‘idols’ shows contempt for their phoney and supposed gods, and an exposure of their foolishness. He observed the aforementioned celestial bodies one after the other, each one succeeded the previous one which set and became absent, in order to use their condition as a clear proof of the fallacy of their having any divinty or right to worship as his people claimed. Who was it who protected and guarded them and controlled their affairs and the affairs of the creation when they passed and set?! Therefore they must reject the false divinity and right to worship which they claimed for them and disbelieve in that. It was upon them to wash their hands of them and turn instead to their true God, He Who created and brought into existence the heavens and the earth. He Who does not pass away or depart. He Who knows all about their condition and is fully aware of all their movements and periods of rest. He Who protects and preserves them and controls their affairs. They were strong proofs extracted from the situation they experienced and the visible creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And recite to your people from the Book (the Qur’aan), O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , about Ibraaheem. He was one who was fully truthful and one sent as a Prophet by Allaah. When he said to his father, ‘Why do you worship that which cannot hear, nor see, nor benefit you, nor remove any harm from you at all?! O my father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, so accept the sincere advice I give you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray. O my father, do not worship Satan (by obeying him in his call for you to worship the idols) &#8211; indeed Satan is one disobedient to the Most Merciful (Allaah). O my father, I fear for you, knowing that if you die upon attribution of partners to Allaah in worship, and upon worship of Satan, that Allaah’s punishment and torment will be upon you, and that you will merely be a companion of Satan in the Hell-fire.’ He replied, ‘Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem? If you do not cease abusing and reviling them I will certainly revile you. Go away from me if you wish to remain safe from me.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘But you are safe from me harming you, I will rather ask my Lord to guide you and forgive your sins. He has always been most Gracious and Kind to me. I shall keep away from you and all that you worship besides Allaah, and I will worship and invoke my Lord, making all of worship purely for Him. I hope that I shall not be one unblest in my worship and supplications.’ So when he separated himself from them and all that they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him a family who were better than them, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob, and we made all of them Prophets, and we bestowed our mercy upon them all, and granted them renown and praise upon the tongues of the people.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent call to <em>tawheed</em>, established firmly upon knowledge, reason and intellect, and upon good and sound manners. Guiding the misguided to the Straight Path. It was opposed by blind bigotry and partisanship, based upon desires, ignorance, stubborness and obsinate pride: otherwise how could anyone worship and humble themselves to those who cannot hear, nor see, nor help them in any way?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the knowledge of <em>tawheed</em>, O reader, is that knowledge which all the Prophets were honoured with, and with it they assaulted falsehood, ignorance and shirk. So ignorance of this knowledge, the knowledge carried by the Prophets, which guides to the truth and saves from misguidance and shirk, ignorance of this is fatal and is a deadly poison which kills the intellect and the ability to think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, accept the sincere advice which I give to you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after these robust efforts in <em>da’wah</em> expended by Ibraaheem in calling to Allaah, calling the family and the nation, establishing the irrefutable proofs upon his father and his people, after this he took this great call and confronted that haughty and tyrannical ruler who claimed divinity, he faced him with the full strength and bravery. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do you not consider the one (Namrood) who, because Allaah had granted him an extended kingdom disputed with Ibraaheem about his Lord. Ibraaheem said to him, ‘It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded, and Allaah does not guide the unbelievers to find proof against the people of truth.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem called this tyrant and claimant to divinity to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to <em>eemaan</em> in His Lordship. But he exceeded all bounds in his arrogance and haughtily refused to accept the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to give up on his claims to Lordship. So Ibraaheem debated with him in this brilliant manner whose proof was clear. Ibraaheem said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the stupid tyrant replied that he too could give life and death &#8211; meaning that he killed whom he pleased and spared whom he pleased. This answer of his was merely a pretence and a means of fooling the ignorant, and was a way of avoiding the question, since what Ibraaheem referred to was the fact that his Lord created mankind, animals and plants and gave them life, and brought them into existence from nothing. Then He causes them to die with His Power, and that He gives the humans and animals death at the end of their appointed life-spans, due to visible causes which He shows and without visible causes. So when Ibraaheem saw that he tried to create a pretence to evade the issue, which might fool some of the ignorant and common folk, he then said, as a means of showing the futility of what his saying entailed, that if you are as you claim, then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the unbeliever was left confounded and at a loss for words. His argument was overthrown, he was silenced, struck dumb and falsehood was rendered futile as is always the case. So this contains a lesson for those who listen attentively and witness it, that the call to <em>tawheed</em> represents the peak of sincerity, wisdom and intelligence; it proceeds in the due and correct manner, and as Allaah has willed, not merely struggling for kingship, nor seeking to fight for leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the goal of Ibraaheem had been to attain rulership and authority he would have taken a different methodology to this, and he would have found people who gathered around him and supported him. But Allaah refuses, and His Prophets and the pious callers from the true followers of the Prophets in every time and place, they all refuse except to follow the way of guidance and truth, and to clearly proclaim the truth and to establish the proof against the proud and obstinate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem established this great obligation in the best and most complete manner. He established the proof upon his father and his people, upon those who governed them and upon all of his nation. Then when he saw that they were persisting in their <em>shirk</em> and their unbelief and were established upon falsehood and misguidance, he resorted to censure and correction by means of the hand and use of strength. So where did his change and correction begin, and what was the correct and rightly guided means for correction of the dire situation which had beset his nation? Did he seek to overthrow the state because it was the root of all the evils and corruption and the source of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance?! How can that be denied when the ruler claimed lordship for himself and persisted in that claim? So why did Ibraaheem not consider a revolution against this unbelieving government, and at the head of it a tyrant who claimed divinity, and by so doing wipe out all the forms of corruption and <em>shirk</em>, and establish in its place the divinely-guided state headed by Ibraaheem, ’<em>alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>?! The answer is the Prophets were far removed from following any such way or even considering it, since this is the way of the oppressors, the ignorant and the foolish, those who seek after this world and strive for authority in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophets were callers to <em>tawheed</em> and pioneers guiding to the truth, and seeking to save the people from falsehood and <em>shirk</em>. So when they applied themselves to correction and changing the state of affairs, and they were the most knowledgeable and intelligent of the people, then they necessarily began with striking at the true sources of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance. This is what Ibraaheem, the mild, wise and rightly guided, the heroic and brave, did. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We guided Ibraaheem to the truth at a young age before the time of Moosaa and Haaroon, and We knew that he was fitting for that and was a person of true and certain <em>eemaan</em> who would worship Allaah alone and not associate any partner with Him. When he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these idols which you worship and are devoted to?!’ They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’ He said, ‘Both you and they in worshipping the idols are in clear error.’ They said, ‘Are you serious in your saying that you have come with the truth, or are you merely being frivolous?’ He said, ‘Rather, I bring you the truth. Your Lord, other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped, is the sole Lord and Creator of the heavens and the earth, He Who created you all, not any of the idols to which you are devoted. I am a witness to the fact that none but Him is deserving of your worship.’ Ibraaheem said in secret (but was overheard by a single man from his people), ‘By Allaah, I intend to destroy their idols when they go off to their festival.’ So he broke them to pieces except for the largest of them (upon which he tied the axe with which he had broken the others), so that they might take heed and abandon worship of their idols after witnessing their weakness and futility. The people said, ‘Who has done this to our gods?! Whoever has done it is certainly a criminal.’ Those who had heard the saying of Ibraaheem said, ‘We heard a youth speaking, he is called Ibraaheem.’ They said, ‘Bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may testify against him.’ They said, ‘Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?’ He said, ‘Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.’ So they turned to themsleves and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’ He said, ‘Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all, nor harm you. Woe to you and the idols which you worship besides Allaah. Have you no sense to see the futility of your worship of the idols?’ They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’ We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom We caused to be the losers.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah guided Ibraaheem to the truth knowing that he was fitting for that. This wise and rightly-guided Prophet faced corruptions in beliefs (<em>’aqeedah</em>) and corruption in rule and authority. A nation whose thinking was degenerate, people whose minds were astray, so that they worshipped idols in the form of pieces of wood, rocks and stars. They were also ruled by a corrupt and evil government lead by a tyrant who claimed divinity, yet the people submitted to his leadership. So where was Ibraaheem to begin his correction? Should he have begun by attacking the ruler, since for certain he had ruled by other than the revelaed Law of Allaah and ruled by the laws of ignorance. There is no doubt about that. He also openly claimed Lordship and the right to make and lay down the law. Or should he have begun with correction of beliefs (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). Correcting the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the nation and the <em>‘aqeedah </em>of the government of ignorance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan informs us that this rightly-guided Prophet, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Prophets, began with correction of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, that is the call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all worship purely and sincerely for Him alone, and fighting and wiping out <em>shirk</em>, and demolishing its causes, and tearing it out from the roots. So that is what he did: he called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to renounce the worship of everything besides Him. He argued with them about this matter and they argued with him. But he refuted them with powerful arguments and clear proofs, and he stripped them of everything they sought to use as a proof until they admitted their wrongdoing, misguidance, and their blind-following and stubborn and fatal acceptance of the ways of their forefathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Ibraaheem saw obstinate following of desires and intellects as hard as rock, he made a wise and brave plan to destroy their idols. He carried out this plan with full vigour, bravery and courage. Then this heroic act[10] incited the government and the nation against him, and they called him for judgement in public and laid down the charge before him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded to them in a mocking and sarcastic manner,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this mocking reply was like a thunder-bolt striking their imbecilic minds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then they relapsed and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he had divested them of the weapon of argument, they resorted to using force, the weapon used by everyone lacking proof in every time and place,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah saved His chosen and beloved friend, Ibraaheem, and He threw back the plot of the unbelievers upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom we caused to be the losers.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fact that Ibraaheem was saved from harm in that huge fire, which Allaah caused to become cool and safe for Ibraaheem, was a very great sign, indeed one of the greatest of Allaah’s signs proving his Prophet hood, his truthfulness, and the correctness of what he came with, i.e., <em>tawheed</em> and the declaration of the fultility of the <em>shirk</em> and misguidance which his people were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah rewarded Ibraaheem, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>for this wise <em>da’wah</em>, and this outstanding <em>jihaad</em> and sacrifice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We saved Ibraaheem and Loot from their enemies and took them to the land which We have blessed for all the worlds. And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq (his son) and Ya&#8217;qoob (his grandson) as an extra favour upon him. And We made all of them those who acted in obedience to Allaah and avoided what He forbade. And We made them leaders to be followed, guiding the people according to Our orders and calling them to worship and obey Allaah. And We inspired in them the doing of those deeds which are good, and establishment of the Prayer, and payment of the <em>Zakaat</em>. And they were worshippers of Us alone.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated by the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (*), that you should follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was a Muslim upon the true religion and was not one of those who worshipped idols and associated partners with Allaah.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad (*): Allaah has indeed spoken the Truth, so follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was upright, upon the religion of Islaam, and he did not make any share of his worship for any created being.”</strong> [Soorah Aal-’Imraan (3):95].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):53.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] The great heroic action and the wise call to <em>tawheed</em> and to the elimination of <em>shirk</em>, is counted by many of the callers to correction these days as being an example of preoccupying onesself with minor and insignificant matters. And there is no action nor power except by the will of Allaah. Indeed it is not the eyes that are blind, but rather the hearts. They think that <em>da’wah</em> must begin with a call to the correction and rectification of rulership and government, not correction of <em>’aqeedah</em>. In this view Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets were in error with regard to the correct methodology of <em>da’wah</em>. (al-Fawzaan).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Nooh (عليه السلام)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh was the second father of all mankind, and the first of the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) to the people of the Earth. This great Prophet lived a very long life: he called his people for nine hundred and fifty years to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making all worship purely for Him. He did not become weary of this, nor lose interest. He called them night and day, in private and in the open. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed We sent Nooh as a Messenger to his people ordering him to warn his people before a painful punishment should come to them. He said, ‘O my People, I am a plain and clear warner to you, that you should worship Allaah alone, avoid disobedience to Him and obey me. If you do so He will forgive you your sins and grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when the term decreed by Allaah comes it cannot be delayed, and if you knew you would submit to and obey your Lord.’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, I have called my people day and night to worship You alone and warned them of Your punishment but my calling them to the truth only results in them turning away from it.</strong>[1]<strong> Whenever I call them to worship You alone and to obey You, and to disassociate themselves from the worship of everything but You, so that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers in their ears and cover themselves up with their garments, so as not to hear. Then they persist in their disbelief and arrogantly and obstinately refuse to follow and submit to the truth. Then I called them loudly and openly, and I called them individually and privately. I said to them, ‘Ask your Lord to forgive your sins and repent to your Lord from your unbelief and association of others in worship with Him, and make your worship sincerely and purely for Him, then He will forgive you, indeed He greatly forgives those who turn to Him in repentance and seek His forgiveness. He will then send you rain in abundance, and grant you increase in wealth and children, and provide you with gardens and rivers. What is wrong with you that you do not have awe and fear of Allaah, when it is He that created you in successive stages? Do you not see how Allaah has created the seven heavens one above the other, and has placed the moon therein as a light and has made the sun a lamp? Allaah it is who created you and brought you from the earth, and He it is who will return you to it, and then resurrect you from it. Allaah &#8211; it is Who spread out the earth for you, so that you may travel about upon wide roads.’’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, they have rejected my call and opposed it, and have instead followed the call of those whose wealth and children only increase them in error and take them further away from their Lord. Furthermore the leaders have plotted a mighty plot, and they have said, “Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon <em>Wadd</em>, nor <em>Suwaa</em>, nor <em>Yaghooth</em>, nor <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>, nor <em>Nasr</em>.” Indeed many have gone astray due to the idols. O Allaah, grant no increase to the transgressors except in error.</strong>[2]<strong> Due to their sins they were drowned in the Flood and entered into the Fire, and they could find no one to save them from Allaah’s punishment.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what did the <em>da’wah</em> of this noble Messenger comprise of, and Allaah has told us the summary of his noble <em>da’wah</em> which continued for nine hundred and fifty years?! Indeed it was an earnest and painstaking call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to make all worship purely for Him. It was a tireless effort and he used every possible means available to him to convince them of his call. He called them privately and individually, and he called them openly. He encouraged them and warned them, informing them of the promise of good for the obedient, and evil for the disobedient. He gave them practical and intellectual proofs, from themselves and their lives, and what they saw before them with regards to the heavens and the earth, and the clear signs and lessons contained in them. All of this failed to benefit them and did not cause them to accept. Rather they persisted in their disbelief and error, and they rejected all this obstinately and arrogantly. They persisted in their adherence to the idols and false and futile objects of worship. So the result of this persistence and obstinancy was destruction and annihilation in this world, and everlasting torment in the Hell-fire in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we may ask: why did this great Prophet continue for such an extremely long period of time, expending huge efforts, untiringly and without languidness, calling to the starting point of <em>tawheed</em>?! Why did Allaah praise him so highly, and cause him to be remembered, and make him one of those Messengers who were the firmest of all in their determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adhm</em>)? Does the call to <em>tawheed</em> deserve all this esteem? Is this methodology an establishment of this procedure for this noble Prophet in opposition to logic, wisdom and intellect? Or is it pure and certain wisdom, and what is demanded by correct logic and sound and perceptive intellect? Why did Allaah approve of following this methodology in <em>da’wah</em> for 950 years, and commend him, and cause his name and his story to endure, and impose it as a duty upon the greatest of the Messengers and the one having the greatest intellect of all the people, that he should take him as an example to follow in his <em>da’wah</em> and his perseverance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The just answer, established upon intellect and wisdom, and upon understanding the status and position of Prophet hood, and having the greatest trust in it and giving it its due respect, is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> and striving to wipe out <em>shirk</em> and to purify the earth from it, does indeed deserve all of this. It is indeed wisdom itself and is demanded by natural inclination and intellect. It is furthermore, a binding obligation upon every caller to Allaah that they understand this methodology, this great and divinely inspired <em>da’wah</em> and great goal, and that they devote all their effort and energy to its attainment and its being propagated throughout all of Allaah’s earth. Furthermore that they work together, cooperate and unite, and sincerely attest to each others’ truthfulness. Just as the Messengers, the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, were: the earlier ones telling of the coming of the later ones and the later ones attesting to the truthfulness of the previous ones and promoting their call, and following the same way. It is also binding upon us to believe that if there was any other methodology better and more correct than this methodology, that Allaah would have chosen that for His Messengers and would have favoured them with it. So is it fitting for any Believer to turn away from it and choose a different methodology for himself, and to arrogantly seek to attack this divinely laid down methodology and its callers?!</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] At-Tabaree reports from Qataadah, “It has reached us that a man would take his son to Nooh and say to his son, ‘Beware of this man, don&#8217;t let him lead you astray, for I remember when I was your age, my father brought me to him and warned me against him just as I am warning you.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] This supplication of Nooh against them came after he was informed by Allaah that they were not going to be Believers, as explained by al-Baghawee.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from Appendix I of  the book : “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah – that is the way of wisdom and intelligence” – by Shaykh Rabee hafidhahullaah, translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Appendix I </strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah alone, and may He send praises and blessings of peace upon the Messenger of Allaah, and upon his family and true followers, and his Companions and those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I praise Allaah, with abundant, pure and blessed praise for every blessing which He has bestowed on me, and I give thanks to Him, the Most High, and praise and extol Him, and I cannot praise and extol Him as truly befits Him, and no-one can do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then from the blessings which Allaah has bestowed on me is that He has enabled me, despite my weakness, to speak the truth openly according to my capability, whether in writing or face to face encounters, so I thank Him and praise Him with praise such as would fill the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. I also ask that He grants me firmness upon that until I meet Him and that He is pleased with me. I further ask that He grants me increase in guidance to what is correct, and protection, and I do not forget, and all praise is for Allaah, that when my book, ‘The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah &#8211; That is the Way of Wisdom and Intellect,’ was published it was accepted by the true Muslim youth in every place with joy and was greatly welcomed. This was because it made the call of the Prophets clear to them, until it became as clear as the sun in the middle of the day, and it removed confusion, distortions and the deception of some writers whose hearts were like those of devils in the form of humans those whose only concern is to gather the people around them and around their fraudulent slogans. It does not worry such people that this gathering of people should include the Raafidees (extreme <em>Shee’ah</em>), the hypocrites, the heretical <em>Khawaarij</em>,[2] the extreme Sufis who are guilty of apostasy, the ignorant and their like from the worshippers of the graves, or whichever of the wretched and unfortunate groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not worry them that this type of people rally together with them and rally to their slogans, despite the evil consequences of this in this world and the Hereafter. This is because they are as they were described by Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Callers to the gates of Hell, whoever answers their call will be thrown into it,”</em> and because they are as the sincere, truthful and trustworthy Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   described them, <em>“Devils in the bodies of humans.”</em> If this is not the case then what is it that causes them, and those who follow their lead, to flee from and separate themselves from the clear and radiant way and methodology of the Prophets, which is made clear by the Qur&#8217;aan and shown to be their way and their methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to this His names and attributes, <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His lordship, and <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His worship, and to disbelieve and reject everything that is worshipped besides Him &#8211; that is the pure religion. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah &#8211; so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Study any of the other <em>da’wah</em>s of the sects and parties &#8211; other than the <em>Salafee</em>[5] <em>da’wah </em>&#8211; do you see this methodology or any trace of it in their schooling, their persons, or their <em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>? Then show it to me if you are truthful. As for myself I do not find in these sects and parties except that they wage a fierce war against this methodology and its people. I do not see except belittlement and mockery of this methodology and its people. I do not see except hatred and enmity for this methodology and its people, and I do not see except warm greetings and respect from them for the deviant and misguided calls and their people. Indeed you will frequently see and hear the last of these from those who disguise themselves as <em>Salafees</em> but are in reality closer in relation to their enemies, and there are ties and relationships between them which are such as they are known only to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are some who are passionately in love with the state of superstitions, innovations and misguidance who think- and evil are their thoughts, and evil is the lie which they invent- that Imake a separation between the religion and the State, and that I dispute about the importance of the subject of authority of sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What a serious word it is that comes out of their mouths! What they say is nothing but a lie”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this book displeased them and it made clear the falsity of their calls and their misrepresentation and distortion of Islaam and of the text concerning <em>tawheed </em>&#8211; particularly with regard to the <em>da’wah</em> of the Messengers, may Allaah’s praise and blessings of peace be upon them. The book did not join them in welcoming the state of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ahs</em>. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets founded upon the building of the tombs and upon the belief that the pious who have died know the Hidden and Unseen and have some control over the creation. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets based upon any such things as have preceded, nor in accepting the misguidance and <em>shirk</em> of secularism which seeks to disguise itself in the guise of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the book, and all praise is for Allaah, made clear that the true and trustworthy <em>da’wah</em> is that which follows the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah, and the state which is established upon this correct methodology &#8211; that is the Islamic state. Then despite the fact that the book was dealing with a particular topic &#8211; which was to explain the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah &#8211; it still gave attention to mentioning the Islamic state which it mentioned repeatedly and emphasised a number of times. It even had a chapter headed: &#8220;The view of the scholars of Islaam concerning leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) and their proofs of its obligation&#8221;. Then the scholars sayings about that were quoted and their proofs mentioned. However what angered the people of innovations and desires, and the callers to falsehood, is that I placed leadership and the state in the place given to them by Allaah and which was accepted by the scholars of Islaam. I did not support the people of innovation and desires in their abandonment of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to <em>tawheed</em>, and fighting <em>shirk</em>, innovations and the rest of the types of misguidance and deviation, and fighting idolatry and grave-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor did I support them in making leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) the most important matter, and the most fundamental principle &#8211; which is something which has led people to rejection of the methodology of the Prophets and has lead them to fight against it. It has also led them to fling themselves into the arms of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>, and to having affection for them, and to allying themselves with them, defending them and to falsley adorning their ideology which is at war with Islaam, in opposition to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and waging war against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   and his pure wives and the rest of the Muslims and their scholars. Indeed it goes beyond that to the point that they declare these great people to be disbelievers and make the foulest attacks against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not support them in this misguidance and this loathsome excess, so they disliked the book and thought evil about its author. So they said the falsehood which they said in order to turn the youth who thirst for the truth away from the irrefutable and clear truth in this book. This book which openly spoke the truth and placed both correct creed and belief (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and the state in the place given to them by Allaah &#8211; without going beyond the bounds or falling short, and without distorting and deception. Then it is essential that I explain to the youth the distinction between the state (<em>ad-Dawlah</em>) and the dominion and sovereignty of Allaah (<em>al-Haakimiyyah</em>). As for the state, then it is a gathering of people who may be disbelievers, may be misguided deviants, or may be Believers. Then the people may be gathered under a rightly- guided <em>khilaafah</em>, or restricted kingships- which has been the case with the Islamic states after the rightly -guided <em>khilaafah</em>. So these individuals who form the Believing state are no more than the means to implement the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah- the establishment of <em>jihaad</em>, the ordering of good and forbidding of evil, establishment of the Prescribed Punishments and retribution, and the protection of the <em>ummah</em> from the plots and aggression of the enemies against the lands of the Muslims and against their souls, their wealth and their honour. So the Muslims must establish a state to accomplish these great obligations &#8211; either : by giving the pledge of allegiance to a <em>khaleefah</em> whom all of the Muslims are united upon; or by the fact that an individual from the <em>ummah</em> gains ascendancy and has power, an army and authority &#8211; which means that the benefit of the <em>ummah</em> lies in accepting him as long as he proclaims Islaam, establishes the laws and the creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and protects the <em>ummah</em> from its enemies and does whatever is required, the details of which are known and mentioned in the source works of Islaam; or by the fact that some individuals gain ascendancy over some areas as happened in the lands of Islaam after the weakening of the <em>khilaafah</em>, so overall benefit necessitated submitting to this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for dominion and sovereignty then these are attributes of Allaah and qualities particular to Him alone, as He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Judgement and command is for Allaah alone, He ordered that you should worship none but Him. That is the true and straight religion.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this authority and sovereignty is not denied except by one who is a disbeliever in Allaah and is severe in his enmity to Allaah, His Messenger and His Books. Indeed one who even denies Allaah’s authority in the slightest matter, not to mention with regard to fundamental matters, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of Islaam if he knowingly denies that. As for the ignorant person, then he has excuse until the proof is established against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have said applies to the rulers, the ruled and to indivduals and groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>). This has been affirmed by the trustworthy scholars of Islaam, and from them Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah,</em>[8] and his student Ibnul-Qayyim.[9] So whoever accepts and abides by this rule and authority in the fundamentals of the religion and its details, and in matters of creed and belief, and matters of worship, and dealings and political affairs, and economic affairs, and manners, and social affairs &#8211; then he is a Believer. But he who does not abide by it all or some of these then he is a disbeliever, whether he is an individual or a group, a ruler or one ruled, a caller or one called. Indeed I fear, by Allaah, for many of the sects, parties and individuals that they may fall into disbelief due to their not abiding by the rule and authority of Allaah with regard to the fundamentals of the religion, indeed with regard also to its details. I fear for many of them, against whom the proof has been established and to whom the truth has been made clear, yet still they persist in opposing the call to <em>tawheed</em> and oppose waging war against shirk and innovation, aswell as opposing its people and to cutting from them. Instead these people incite others against and warn against those who call with the call of the Prophets, and those who seek truly and sincerely to amend the affairs. After establishment of the proof against such a person he would fall into the abyss of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I call all of the <em>ummah</em> &#8211; its rulers and its ruled, its indivduals, sects, and parties, to all have true belief in the all-encompassing authority and sovereignty of Allaah which covers the fundamental matters of the religion and its details, and that they should fully abide by it with regard to the fundamental matters of the religion and its details. I also call the heads of the states, from those who abide generally by the rule and authority of Allaah, and yet are negligent in some areas of practice, I call them to abide by it totally and unrestrictedly in every field, in the matter of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and worship, and dealings, and economics, and politics, and with regard to ordering good and forbidding evil, and that they should strive to fight against <em>shirk</em> and innovations, and against sins and against evil &#8211; particularly usury and the rest of the major sins which harm the <em>ummah</em> and its manners. Indeed Allaah prevents by means of the rulers those who are not prevented by the Qur’aan. They should be fully aware that Allaah will question them about every small and large matter which they are responsible for. <em>“Each of you is a guardian and is responsible for thoses whom he is in charge of.” </em>I also remind them of the saying of the Prophet, <em>“There is no ruler having authority over Muslim subjects who dies while he is decieving them except that Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him.”</em>[10] and his saying, <em>“There is no servant whom Allaah places in authority over some people, and he does not deal with them sincerely and honestly, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.”</em>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From sincerity to the <em>ummah</em> is that you encourage them to abide by the ruler of Allaah and His <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, by teaching them, directing them, encouraging and warning them, and by ordering the good and forbidding the evil, and by establishing prescribed punishment and using every means which will cause them to respect the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in <em>‘aqeedah</em>, worship, political affairs and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also call the heads of state in Islamic lands who do not abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah that they should turn back to Allaah and respect His religion which is found in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and that they should cling to the creed and beliefs of this religion and its rulings, and to be proud of that &#8211; since therein lies honour and nobility. However total disgrace and humiliation comes from submission to laws laid down by the most despicable humans, the enemies of this <em>ummah</em> whether they are Jews, Christians, Magians or atheists. So I call such leaders to respect the feelings of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam which has striven and fought and sacrificed millions of its sons for the achievement of a noble and lofty goal &#8211; which is that it should be ruled by Islaam, and Islaam alone is the religion of Allaah, the Creator of this creation, the Creator of mankind and <em>jinn</em> so that they should worship Him alone and submit to His revealed laws alone. They should abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and impose it upon the <em>ummah</em> in creed and beliefs, in manners, in teaching and in Islamic curriculae which education and training are to be based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also enjoin the scholars of the <em>ummah</em>, and its callers, and parties and groups that they should sincerely advise all of the <em>ummah</em>, its elders and its youth, its males and its females, and unite them upon the Book of Allaah, the <em>Sunnah</em> of his Messenger, and upon the methodology and understanding of the <em>Salalafu-Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the Companions, the <em>Taabieen</em> and those who followed them upon good, the <em>imaams</em> of guidance, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em>, the scholars of <em>hadeeth</em> and of <em>tafseer</em>, in creed and beliefs, in worship, in manners, in dealings, in economic affairs, and all the other affairs of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>. Then they should fully comprehend the Sayings of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the transgressors.”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the disobedient.”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should understand that these Sayings of Allaah apply to all individuals, groups, rulers and subjects. So to restrict it to refer it to the rulers alone and not to the people of deviant sects and misguidance, those who do not judge by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in their creed and beliefs, nor in their worship and their behaviour, then this is from ignorance, misguidance and foolishness, since Allaah sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning the Jews at a time when they had not had any state or authority for centuries. He sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning them at a time when He had imposed humiliation and lowliness upon them. I have explained the authority and sovereignty of Allaah in this broad and all-embracing sense in the book itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I should also not fail to draw attention to an error made by the author of <em>‘Meezaanul-I&#8217;tidaal litaqyeem Kitaabil-Mawridiz-Zallaal fir-Tanbeeh &#8216;alaa Akhtaa’iz Zilaal,’ </em>who is ’Isaam ibn Muhammad ibn Taahir al-Barqaawee, who attributed to me something which my tongue has never uttered and which I never believed, nor have I ever written such a thing. Furthermore I seek Allaah’s refuge from what he said, and I declare myself free before Allaah from it, and I ask Allaah to save me and all the Muslims from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee said in a footnote (p.15) to his aforementioned book: “This also reminds me of what Shaykh Rabee&#8217; ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee, <em>hafizahullaahu ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, did in his book, <em>‘Manhajul-Anbiyaa fid-Da’wah illallaah&#8230;’ </em>when he criticised the view of al-Maududi, <em>rahimahullaah ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, about the importance of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), <em>khilaafah</em>, and judging by that which Allaah sent down, since he also sought to use as evidence the saying of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah about the position of the <em>imaamah</em> with the Raafidee (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). So he took up six pages in quoting the discussion of Shaykhul-Islaam with those <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). However the numerous and great differences between the beliefs of the <em>Raafidees</em> concerning the <em>imaamah</em> and the infallibility of the <em>Imaams</em>, and the twelve <em>imaams</em> and so on, and between what al-Maududi and others call to, i.e. the necessity and importance of striving to return to judging by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, through the <em>khilaafah</em>, and to establish a single ruler for the people of Islaam; the differences between these two are well known. Even if the words of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah contain something which is fitting in this regard, yet most of it, if a just person were to examine it, is not fitting to this discussion, rather it applies to the matter of <em>imaamah</em> with the <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>) with its well known details&#8230; so he should not have quoted it all&#8230; for fear of deception.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee&#8217;s scales are unbalanced and he has not judged between myself and al-Maududi with justice, and perhaps he has forgotten the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And weigh justly with the true balance.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Woe to those who give short measure to others. Those who demand full measure from others, but when they give them in measure or weight then they give them less than their due. Do these people not think that they will be ressurected for reckoning on a formidable Day. The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother al-Barqaawee, I was debating the view of al-Maududi about the importance of the matter of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), the <em>khilaafah</em> and judging by that which Allaah has sent down!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the fact of their importance, then no Believer having a trace of <em>eemaan</em> would dispute that. But O brother you have failed to note the point of disagreement between myself and al-Maududi. I debated with the view of al-Maududi with regard to his going beyond the due limits about leadership to such an extent that no Muslim who has respect for Islaam could remain silent about this excess, and it was of such a level that even the misguided would not accept it, not to mention the people of <em>hadeeth</em> and the <em>Salafees</em>. Indeed very many scholars from his own land, from the <em>Salafees</em> and others have replied to him. Then this excess of his has travelled and has reached many Arab and Islamic lands, and it has fooled an overwhelming majority of authors and youth, which has led to great neglect of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and even comtempt of it and of its people. It has also led people to treat <em>shirk</em> and innovation lightly and has caused al-Maududi and his like to ally themsleves with and to befriend the devotees of the graves and even the <em>Raafidees</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>), and to gather these people under their banner, to treat them as brothers, to love and defend them and their beliefs and creed, and this is something which is a reality and is clear to everyone possessing intellect and religion. So since the matter has reached this frightful state, I replied to al-Maududi with regard to some of his excess in order to make the people in general aware, and also the people of the Arabian Peninsula, to which the followers of al-Maududi and their helpers direct their attention. So they seek to wipe away the <em>’aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and the <em>’aqeedah</em> of true and correct alliance and enmity (<em>al-Walaa wal-Baraa</em>). Do you think that my reply to al-Maududi was so unreasonable that you seek to defend his view with falsehood, and by forgetting to judge justly, to the point that you take my words to mean something which I did not say, and which they did not mean?! Listen to what al-Maududi says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The question of leadership is the most important matter in human life and its most fundamental principle.” Then try to defend this saying with clear and unequivocal texts from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and the words of the Companions and the scholars of Islaam. If you have not seen this, then you must adjust your scales in order to establish justice, equity and fairness, and to abandon the excess which has led al-Maududi and his followers to scorn the call of the Prophets and the goal of their <em>da’wah</em>, and to turn the affairs upside down. Listen to his saying: “The true goal of the religion is to establish the system of the rightly guided and righteous leadership (<em>imaamah</em>).” So to him this is the true goal of the religion. So <em>tawheed</em>, and the Prayer, and<em> Zakaat</em>, and <em>jihaad</em> and other matters from the religion become only means to reach this goal in the view of al-Maududi. So produce the clear proofs from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , in place of al-Maududi, to support this and if you are unable then do not be too embarrassed to say, ‘This poor weak servant, Rabee’ ibn Haadee, has spoken the truth and has been sincere towards Islaam and the Muslims, and has put matters in their due place.’ Then listen to the saying of al-Maududi: “This is the purpose for which the Prayer, Fasting, the <em>Zakaat</em> and the <em>Hajj</em> have been made obligatory in Islaam. Then the fact that they are called acts of worship does not mean that they are themselves worship, rather its meaning is that they prepare mankind for the true and fundamental worship, and these are a training course which are essential for that.&#8217; He also says, &#8216;You think that standing facing the <em>Qiblah</em>, placing the right hand upon the justify, and <em>rukoo&#8217;</em> with your hands upon your knees, and prostration upon the ground, and reciting particular words, and these actions and movements are themselves worship; and you think that fasting from the start of <em>Ramadaan</em> until the start of <em>Shawwaal</em>, and going hungry and thirsty from morning until evening, you think that this is worship; and you think that reciting a number of <em>Aayaat</em> from the Qur&#8217;aan is worship; and you think that performing <em>Tawaaf</em> around the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> is worship. In summary you have called the manifestation of certain actions worship, and when a person performs these actions with their form and manners you think that he has worshipped Allaah&#8230; but the truth is that the worship which Allaah created you for, and which he ordered you to perform is something else.”[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you pleased by this derisive manner about speaking about the great pillars of Islaam and those who worship in this way? These are not, in the view of al-Maududi, forms of worship for which man was created, rather the worship for which man was created and which they were ordered to fulfil is something else. O Barqaawee, do you take this as your religion before Allaah? That the forms of worship are only a training course which if applied will&#8230; etc. Is this something stated textually in the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and which the Prophets came with and which was accepted by the best of the people of this <em>ummah</em>? If you agree with al-Maududi then bring the proofs to support his saying. Otherwise bite upon your knuckles in regret and grief for having deserted the truth and offended its people and helped falsehood. This, O my brother, was the subject of my debate with al-Maududi, and about which I quoted the words of Shaykhul-Islaam concerning the exceeding of the bounds by the <em>Raafidees</em> about leadership (imaamate). What I quoted from him was all relevant, not just a part of it as al-Barqaawee claimed. Then if you were correct, O Barqaawee, then why did you not explain what was relevant from the words of Shaykhul-Islaam and what was not? As for the claim of &#8216;infallibility&#8217; for the &#8216;twelve imaams,&#8217; then I did not attribute it to al-Maududi, nor did I debate about it with him, nor did I quote Shaykhul-Islaam’s words about it. So your words are totaly opposed to justice! As for your equity and justice which you set up for yourself in judging between Sayyid Qutb and ad-Duwaysh, then I do not know what you have done. Indeed you have totally failed to be just between myself and al-Maududi, and how would it have harmed you to speak the truth? Then as for the <em>khilaafah</em>, I do not know if you read what I wrote and quoted from the scholars of Islaam, or if you merely took the subject with the tips of your fingers with your eyes closed, thinking that justice and equity would be achieved that easily. So read this and that anew and speak the truth, supporting it with proof, not alarmism and agitation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for judging by that which Allaah sent down, then how can you imagine that I would dispute about it with al-Maududi or anyone else, when it is something known necessarily in the religion, and not even the deviant and deviated sects dispute about it?! So I seek Allaah’s refuge from what the author of <em>‘al-Meezaan,’</em> attributed to me. Rather read again what I wrote concerning the authority and sovereignty of Allaah, and that it comprehends every part of the religion, and you will see the extent of the mistake of al-Barqaawee, may Allah guide him. Then finally the points of criticism of al-Maududi and his like are so many that this introduction is not the place for them. But in summary, he is one of those furthest from abiding by the authority and sovereignty of Allaah with regard to his <em>’aqeedah</em> and his <em>Fiqh</em>, and with regard to his stance on the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and his stance with regard to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and with regard to their enemies the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>. Indeed he and his followers have alliance and friendship with those <em>Raafidees</em>, they support them and they praise their <em>Taaghoot</em>, al-Khomeini and his students, the <em>Aayatur-Raafidiyyah</em>. So noble reader be aware of this, and judge the people according to the truth, and do not judge the truth according to its people, and beware of falling into the abyss of over-exaggerated respect for personalities so that it leads you to reject the truth, and to argue against its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah guide and grant the <em>ummah</em> to loving the truth and its people. Indeed my Lord hears and responds to supplications.</p>

<p>[The following is the continuation of the article @ <em><a title="Permanent Link to The Call to Allah : Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/">The Pillars which support the correct Da’wah</a></em> – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. So whichever call is not <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/"><strong>built upon these foundations</strong></a>, and whatever methodology is not from the methodology of the Messengers &#8211; then it will be frustrated and fail, and it will be toil without any benefit. The clearest proofs of this are those present day groups (<em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which set out a methodology and programme for themselves and their <em>da’wah</em> which is different to the methodology of the Messengers. These groups have neglected the importance of <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief and creed) &#8211; except for a very few of them &#8211; and instead call for the correction of side-issues. So one group calls for the correction of rule and politics, and demands establishment of the prescribed punishments, and that Islamic Law be applied in judging amongst the people, and this is indeed something very important, but it is not what is most important &#8211; <strong>since how can one seek to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the thief and the fornicator before seeking to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the <em>mushrik</em>, the one who attributes worship to others besides Allaah?! How can we demand that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to two men disputing about a sheep or a camel before demanding that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to those who worship idols and graves, and those who deny or hold heretical beliefs with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes, divesting them of their true meanings, or distorting them?! </strong>Are these people not greater criminals than those who fornicate, drink wine and steal?! Those are crimes against mankind, whereas <em>shirk</em> and denial of Allaah’s Names and Attributes are crimes against the Creator, the One free of all imperfections, and the right of the Creator has precedence over the rights of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, <em>al-Istiqaamah</em> (1/466): “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So these sins along with correct <em>tawheed </em>are better than corrupted <em>tawheed</em> in the absence of these sins</span>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another <em>jamaa&#8217;ah</em> affiliates itself with <em>da’wah</em>, except that its methodology is also at variance with the methodology of the Messengers. They give no importance to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em>, rather they give importance to worshipping and practising some <em>dhikr </em>(remembrance of Allaah) in the way of the <em>Sufis</em>.[2]They concentrate upon going out (<em>khurooj</em>) and touring the lands, and what is important to them is that they manage to attract the people to join them, without caring about their beliefs and creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). All of these are innovated ways, taking as their starting point matters which were justify until last in the call of the Messengers. This is just like the case of one who seeks to cure a body whose head has been cut off, since the place of <em>‘aqeedah</em> in the religion is like the head with regard to the body. So it is necessary for these groups to correct their concepts and understanding by referring back to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> in order to know the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah. For indeed Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, informed that correct rule and sovereignty, which is the central part of the call of the former <em>Jamaa&#8217;ah</em> whom we mentioned, cannot be achieved except after correcting <em>‘aqeedah</em> such that all worship is for Allaah alone, and worship of everything else is abandoned. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them, grant them authority to practise the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord, then they are the rebellious transgressors.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people wish to establish the Islamic State before purifying the lands of idolatrous beliefs which take shape in the worship of the dead, and devotion to tombs, such as is no different to the worship of al-Laat, al-’Uzzaa and the third of them <em>Manaat</em>,[4] rather it is worse. So they are attempting that which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed establishment and application of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments; establishment of the Islamic State; avoidance of whatever is prohibited; and achievement of whatever is obligatory &#8211; all of these things are from the rights of <em>tawheed</em>, and matters which perfect it and follow on from it. So how can we give attention to that which is subsidiary whilst neglecting that which is of primary importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is my view that the fact that these groups are at variance with the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah is a result of their ignorance of this methodology, and the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller, since one of the most important conditions for <em>da’wah</em> is knowledge, as Allaah, the Most High, says about His Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me. I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one of the most important qualifications for a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>) is knowledge.[6] Then we see that these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which attribute themselves to <em>da’wah</em> are at variance with each other. Each group lays down a programme different to the programme of the others and follows a different methodology to it. This is the inevitable consequence of contradicting the methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , since the way and methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   is a single way, containing no division, nor divergence, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the followers of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   are upon this single way and are not divided and split. Rather those who contradict this way are the ones who divide amongst themselves, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“This is my Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow any of the other paths, for they will split you and take you away from that way which He prescribed for you.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) are a threat to Islaam which may obstruct it, or prevent people from entering into it, then this is something which must be properly explained, and it must be made clear that this is something which is not from Islaam at all. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who divide up the true religion and break up into sects and parties, you, O Muhammad, have nothing to do with them.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So since explanation of this is obligatory and it is binding to make it clear, a group of scholars having sincere concern for Islaam and the required level of knowledge and research took on the task of indicating the mistakes of these groups and explaining where they are at variance in <em>da’wah</em> with the methodology of the Prophets, so that they may return to what is correct. Indeed the truth is that which the Muslim always seeks, and so that those who do not realise their errors may not be beguiled by them. So from these scholars who took on this great duty of acting upon the saying of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“The religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice.” We said, “To whom, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “To Allaah, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk,”</em> &#8211; from those who explained this matter and gave sincere advice about it is the noble Shaykh, Dr. Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee in his book entitled, &#8216;The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah, That is the Way of Wisdom and Intelligence.&#8217; For he explains, may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good, the Methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah, as it is shown in the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  . He presents the methodologies of the variant groups in the light of this in order to clearly show the difference between the methodology of the Messengers and these differing and contrasting methodologies which are at variance with it. He discusses these methodologies in the scholarly way and in a just way, whilst quoting examples and witnesses to what he says. So his book, and all praise and thanks are for Allaah, accomplishes the goal, and is fully sufficient for those who desire the truth, and is a proof upon those who are stubborn and obstinate in opposing what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to reward him for his work, and to cause it to be of benefit, and may Allaah send praise and blessings of peace upon Muhammad, his family and true followers, and His Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The proof for this is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High, <strong>“Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives whatever is lesser than that to whom He pleases.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa (4):48]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] But some of those who claim to be callers to Islaam, if you were to ask them, “What is Islaam?” “What are the things which negate Islaam?” Then they would not be able to give a correct answer, so how can it be permissible for such a person to be a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>)?!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>.. So I am amazed at the situation of many callers today who see the manifestation of <em>shirk </em>in front of their eyes, yet it does not cause them any concern whatsoever and they do not give any attention to it. Indeed what is even worse is that they complain about those who criticise it and who feel pained by this evil state of affairs which remains from the days of ignorance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. intellect, wisdom and the natural way therefore necessitates that the starting point is to wage war against the danger of <em>shirk</em>, and that the call of the Prophets and their followers should continue fighting it for as long as anything of it remains, or any form or manifestation of it continues. So if a nation is afflicted by matters damaging to its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and <em>shirk</em> which destroys its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and also is beset by economic and political problems, then where is wise treatment of the problems to begin?! As for the Prophets, then they did not begin except with applying their full efforts to treating problems facing <em>‘aqeedah</em>. Then beginning by seeking to treat the most dangerous problem is a matter about which all humans with intellect agree upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, for example, if a person with intellect saw a snake and an ant moving towards a person, then his intellect would lead him to hasten to repel or kill the snake due to the greater danger which it poses to a person. It is not possible that he would divert his attention to the ant, nor even to a thousand such ants. Also if a number of people possessing intellect saw that a fierce lion and a number of rats attacked them all at once, then they would all strive together to prevent the attack of the lion and they would forget all the rats, even if a group of frogs came with them. And if a group of travellers came to a point where they had no choice but to take one of two roads: the first passed by volcanoes which were emitting flames and fire, and flinging out rocks and boulders. Then the second road passed through areas of thorny bushes, and sun-baked ground and was subject to the heat of the sun. Then anyone with intellect would not choose except to take the second road.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So now let us think about the most severe problems and ills. I mean the problems in political affairs, social affairs and economic affairs, and the worst of these is corruption in matters relating to rulership and judgement. Then let us weigh this against corruption in matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>. So are these two things equal in weight with Allaah and with the Prophets, or is it the case that one is more severe, dangerous and worse in its consequences?!! So in the scale of Allaah and the scale of the Prophets the most dangerous of these two, and the one which has the greater demand for attention throughout the ages, and with all the Messengers, is <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations, whose evil and corruption cannot be matched by any other evil no matter how great. So upon this we repeat and say, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">All of the Prophets began with correction of matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and by waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations</span>,” and this is what is demanded by wisdom and intellect and that is due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Firstly</span>,</strong> that corruption relating to matters of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the people: <em>shirk</em>, false superstitions and beliefs, and the various types of misguidance, is thousands of times more dangerous than the corruption resulting from the corruption in rulership and other affairs. Indeed if we do not say and firmly believe this then we have without knowing it discredited and belittled the Messengers, and we seek Allaah’s refuge from misguidance. Indeed this corruption encompasses the ruler and the ruled. So the rulers themselves in every time and place, except for the Believers from them, humble themselves to the idols, false-gods and tombs. They construct them, protect them, worship them and present offerings to them. They firmly believe that they have some supernatural power over and above their own authority. So they hold that these things cause harm and benefit for them due to the unseen power and authority which they think they possess, or at the very least they think they can intercede with Allaah in order for their problems to be reduced. The clearest example of the submission of the rulers to the idols is the example of the despot who claimed divinity, the Pharaoh, who said, boasting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am your Lord, the Most High.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I know of no other god for you besides me.”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the leaders of his people said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Namrood, the king of the Chaldeans who claimed lordship for himself. When Ibraaheem, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>broke the idols, Namrood sought to burn Ibraaheem to take revenge for these idols, because they were the gods which he worshipped. Likewise the kings of India and Persia worship idols and worship fire. The kings of Rome in the past and the present-day rulers of Europe and America worship the cross and worship images. And how many of the past and present-day rulers of the Muslims are afflicted by the trial caused by the dead, so that they build tombs over them, and their hearts are attached to them in love, hope and fear. They fall into that which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) feared for his <em>ummah</em> and which he warned against. So the seriousness and the soundness of the methodology will therefore be clear to you, and also the importance of the firm stance taken by the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) with regard to idols and tombs. Furthermore the wisdom of Ibraaheem will become clear to you, and the depth of his thinking and its extent when he made the enduring call which resounds in all corners and in every generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons far removed from worshipping the idols. O my Lord, they have caused the misguidance of many of the people. So whoever follows me in what I am upon (<em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, making worship purely for Allaah and disassociation from the worship of idols) then he is from my people (upon my way and religion), and whoever disobeys me, then indeed You are the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you see Ibraaheem, who was fully upon the truth and the right way, seeking Allaah’s refuge from the evils and danger of the idols, and not seeking His refuge from the evils and danger of the rulers, despite the level of their corruption and their danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Secondly</span>,</strong> the people were upon a single religion (Islaam), upon guidance, but then they diverged from it, so Allaah sent the Prophets as bringers of good tidings of reward for the obedient Believers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for the disobedient unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We do not send Our Mesengers except with good news for the obedient that Paradise and success on the Day of Resurrection is the reward for obedience to Me, and with a warning for those who disobey and reject My commands that We will punish them, so that they may die aware of that. So whoever believes the Messengers and acts righteously in this world by following what they are upon then there will be no fear upon them when they meet their Lord, nor will they grieve about what they justify behind in the world.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers who were sent with the good news of Allaah’s reward for those who obey Allaah, do as He commands and believe in His Messengers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for those who disobey Allaah, contravene His commands and disbelieve in His Messengers, so that those who disbelieve in Allaah and worship others besides Him may have no excuse to avoid punishment after the sending of the Messengers.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“There is no one to whom granting excuse is more beloved than Allaah, therefore He sent the bringers of good-tidings and the warners.”</em>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message?”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger’s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So if you deny Our Messenger, O people, and reject his command for you to worship your Lord and to free yourselves from the worship of idols, then nations before you denied their Messengers who called them to the truth, so Allaah sent His punishment upon them and will do the same with you. The Messenger&#8217;s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this duty of warning and bringing good tidings and conveying the Message is a very exalted, sublime and lofty duty. It is enough in this regard that it was the duty of the Prophets and fully concorded with their lofty station, since it the hardest and the greatest task taken up by mankind. It was then taken up by their inheritors from the true and sincere callers who follow their methodolgy, therefore Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“The people who are most severely tried are the Prophets, then those most like them, then those most like them.”</em> We have also already mentioned the extent of the difficulties faced by the caller to <em>tawheed</em> and that others are unable to persevere in this sphere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Thirldy</span>,</strong> Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, and the Most High, did not start by commanding and making it a duty upon them, as is seen from the stories of their lives, that they should establish states and cause the downfall of others, and this is perfect wisdom since the call to establish a state attracts the seekers of this world, and those who seek after self-elevation and positions of power, and those who have personal goals and grudges, and aspirations and ambitions.[11] So these types of people quickly respond to the call to establish a state which they think will enable them to attain their goals, their desires and their ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the like of these considerations, and Allaah knows best, and due to other reasons known by Allaah, the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the calls of the Prophets and their methodologies were far removed from using these flashy and attractive slogans or those which clearly appeal to short-term ambitions and desires. Rather they followed a methodology which is wise, unblemished and noble. It involves being tried and tested. So they are followed upon this way and believed in by every true and sincere person free of selfish ambitions and personal goals. Such a person does not desire through his <em>eemaan</em>, his <em>tawheed</em> and his obedience to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) except Paradise and the Pleasure of his Lord. He does not fear except from His Anger and His severe punishment. Therefore they are only followed generally by the poor, the needy and the weak. Allaah, the Most High, says, quoting what the people of Nooh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Are we to believe in you, O Nooh, and affirm what you call us to, when it is only the lowly people who follow you?’”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said concerning the people of Saalih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The heads of the people who haughtily rejected Faith said to those who they held to be lowly, to those who believed in and followed Saalih and what he came with, ‘Do you really know that Saalih is one sent by Allaah?’ They said, ‘We indeed attest and believe in the truth and guidance which Allaah has sent him with.’ The haughty ones said, ‘We deny and disbelieve that which you believe in.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also amongst the questions which Heraclius asked Aboo Sufyaan was, “Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them?” Aboo Sufyaan replied, “Rather it is the weak amongst them.” So Heraclius said, “I asked you ‘Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them,’ and you mentioned that it is the weak amongst them, and it is they who are the followers of the Mesengers.” So the call to establish a state is far far easier, and people respond more quickly to it since most people are seekers after this world and followers of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the reasons, the consequences and the difficulties in the way of the calls of the Messengers we find that they are not followed except by a small number of people. So Nooh remained, for nine hundred and fifty years,[14] calling to Allaah, yet despite this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“None but a few believed along with him.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said, <em>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, ‘The nations were presented before me, and I saw a Prophet and with him was a small group of people, and I saw a Prophet along with one man or two men, and a Prophet accompanied by nobody. Then I saw a huge crowd of people and I thought that they were my ummah. So it was said to me, “This is Moosaa and his people. But rather look to the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge crowd, so it was said to me, “This is your ummah, and from them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning.”’”</em>[16]<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah, who refuted and silenced the <em>mushriks </em>with irrefutable and clear proofs. Allaah says regarding him and those who believed along with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So Loot belived in him and attested to the truth of what he came with, and Ibraaheem said, ‘Indeed I will emigrate (to the land of <em>Shaam</em>) for the sake of my Lord. Indeed He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’”</strong>[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Loot and those who were saved from the punishment along with him, and perhaps they were his daughters alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So We brought out those who were Believers from the town, and We did not find there except a single household of Muslims.”</strong>[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But none of this diminishes the rank of the Prophets by the slightest degree, rather they are upon the highest rank and are the noblest and most distinguished of the people and the most honourable. They stand above all the people in manhood, bravery, excellence of language and eloquence, and in their clarity of explanation, their sincerity and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also established their duty of calling to <em>tawheed</em>, propagating the Message, giving the good tidings and the warnings, and they fulfilled this in the most complete manner. So the fact that they had few followers or some of them had no followers, is purely the fault of the nations which refused to accept the call since, in their view, they did not satisfy their lowly goals. Then it may be that they respond to his call, or a large number of them do so, and so they gain a state, as a goodly fruit due to their <em>eemaan</em>, their affirmation of what the Prophet came with, and their righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thus establish the obligation upon them of fighting <em>Jihaad</em> to raise up the Word of Allaah, and of following and applying the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments and other matters prescrbed for them by Allaah. This is what happened with our Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and his noble Companions. Allaah crowned their <em>eemaan</em>, their righteous actions, and their exemplary perseverance when facing the harm and oppression of the <em>mushriks</em>, by aiding them and making their <em>Deen</em> uppermost, and by establishing them upon the earth as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them grant them authority to practice the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me.”</strong>[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then sovereignty was offered to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in Makkah but he refused and he continued calling to <em>tawheed</em> and waging war against <em>shirk</em> and the idols. So when Quraysh became troubled by the call of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they sent ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah and he came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “O son of my brother, you know the excellence you hold amongst us with regard to your position in the tribe and your lineage, but you have brought a matter which is very serious for your people. Because of it you have split their united body, caused their youth to behave foolishly and you have abused their idols with it, and their religion. You have also declared their fore-fathers to be infidels because of it. So listen to me and I will offer you some things which you may consider, and hopefully some of them will be acceptable to you.” So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, “Speak, O Abul-Waleed, I will listen.” He said, “O son of my brother, if what you desire by this matter that you have come with is wealth, then we will gather wealth for you from our wealth until you are one of the richest of us. <strong>And if you wish by it for high position, then we will give you such authority that we will not do anything without your approval, and if you wish by it for sovereignty, then we will make you sovereign over us.</strong> But if it is the case that what comes to you is a demon which you see and cannot get rid of, then we will seek after a medical cure for you and will expend our money until we can get you cured of it. Since a demon may take hold of a person until he is cured and relieved of it,” or as he said. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was listening to him, then he said, “Have you finished, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then listen to me.” He said, “I will do so.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestwoer of Mercy. A Book whose <em>Aayaat</em> are made clear, a recital in pure Arabic for those who know (the pure Arabic language), bringing them good tidings of Paradise if they believe in it and act upon it, and as a warning to those who disbelieve in it and do not act in obedience to Allaah, that they will receive punishment and dwell forever in Hell in the Hereafter. But most of them turn away haughtily and refuse to listen to it.”</strong>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) continued reciting it to him. When ’Utbah heard it he remained silent and sat with his hands behind his back, resting upon them and listening. So when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the <em>Aayah</em> of prostration in it he prostrated and then said, “You have heard what you have heard O Abul-Waleed, so now it is up to you&#8230;” So ’Utbah went back to Quraysh and when he sat with them they said, “What has happened with you, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “What happened is that I heard the like of which, by Allaah, I have never heard. By Allaah, it is not sorcery, nor poetry, nor divining. O Quraysh, obey me and let the decision be mine. Leave the man and let him continue in what he is upon. Keep away from him since, by Allaah, his saying which I heard will come to have great importance. So if the (other) Arabs kill him, then you will be rid of him due to the action of others, and if he conquers the Arabs, then his sovereignty is your sovereignty, his power is your power and you will be the ones fortunate with regard to him.” They said, “By Allaah, he has performed magic upon you with his tongue, O Abul-Waleed.” He said, “This is my opinion with regard to him, you may do whatever you see fit.”[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq reports with his chain of narration to Ibn ’Abbaas that a group of Quraysh gathered and made an offer close to the offer made by ’Utbah and his saying to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) answered them by saying, “I am not afflicted by what you say. I have not come with that which I have come with seeking your wealth, nor seeking status above you, nor sovereignty over you, but rather Allaah has sent me as a Messenger to you, and has sent down a Book to me, and has ordered me to be a bringer of good tidings and a warner to you. So I have conveyed to you the revealed Messages from my Lord, and I have sincerely advised you. So if you accept what I have brought to you then you will have your share in this world and the Hereafter. But if you refuse to accept it from me then I will patiently await Allaah’s Order, until Allaah judges between me and you&#8230;”[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) rejected the request of one of the tribes that they should be in charge of the affairs after his death, if the report is authentic. Ibn Ishaaq said that az-Zuhree narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to Banoo ’Aamir ibn Sa’sa’ah and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and presented himself to them. So a man from them called Bayharah ibn Firaas said, “By Allaah, if I were to take hold of this young man from Quraysh I would devour the Arabs with him,” then he said, “If we give you our pledge of allegiance upon your affair, then Allaah gives you victory over those who oppose you, then will we be in authority after you?” He said, “The affair is for Allaah, He places authority wherever He wills.” So he said to him, “Are we to risk our necks before the Arabs for you, then when Allaah grants you victory, authority will be for other than us?! We have no need of your affair.” So they rejected him.[23]</p>

In addition, Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah also explains some Points from Shaykh Uthaymeen and other Imaams as well.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the brief description of the Book from the Publisher:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a brief yet extremely beneficial explanation of Sheikh al-Islam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#8217;s famous Kitab al-Tawhid. The book, as the title suggests, deals with the subject of worshipping Allah alone without associating partners with Him. The author highlights many matters that have become common among Muslims even though they are clearly acts of shirk or associating partners with Allah. Not only is this book distinguished due to the importance of the subject matter but also due to the methodology adopted by the author for which he is well known. The reader will find that the majority of the book consists of verses of the Qur&#8217;an, ahadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and sayings of the early Muslims.  The explanation presented at the end of each chapter of Kitab al-Tawhid is that of the renowned scholar Allamah Abd al-Rahman al-Sa di, counted among the major scholars of recent times. He was born in al-Qasim, Saudi Arabia, in the year 1307AH, and from a young age became engrossed in the attainment of knowledge. His dedication and thirst for knowledge led him to become an authority in many of the Islamic sciences as is evident from the books that he authored. He passed away in the year 1376 AH, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [85]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> (ميثاق – covenant) which Allaah, the Most High, took from Aadam and his descendants, that they would worship Him and not associate anything in worship along with Him, this is true. Just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us, that Allaah extracted the descendants of Aadam from his back, and they were like tiny red ants, and He caused them to bear witness upon themselves to His Unity. And He took their <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> (covenant) that they would worship Him, and not associate anything in worship along with Him.[1] So we have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in this. However, this agreement and covenant is not sufficient (in itself). Rather, it was essential along with it, to send the Messengers. So therefore, Allaah sent the Messengers. And if this had been sufficient alone, then Allaah would not have sent the Messengers. However, He sent the Messengers in order to remind by means of them, and to call the people to what is contained in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for His saying, He, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <em><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when your Lord took out from the descendants of Aadam, their offspring.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of <em>Tafseer</em> (explainers of the Qur·aan), they hold that this refers to the agreement and the covenant which Allaah took from the descendants of Aadam; but that is not the case. Rather, it is something else. And Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“From their backs”</strong> and He did not say, “…from the back of Aadam”. And the completion of the <em>aayah</em> is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He caused them to witness upon themselves, “Am I not your Lord?” So they said, “Yes indeed!”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of the scholars say the meaning of this is: the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> (الفطرة – the inborn nature) which Allaah created them upon, and the signs within the creation which Allaah set up; so that from them, they should know and be aware of their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect, created them upon the nature of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and upon Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And set your face straight upon the Religion, turning away from <u>sh</u>irk, which is the inborn way upon which Allaah created all of the people.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that (natural inborn way upon which Allaah created the people) is the religion of Islaam and the religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed. </em>So, Islaam means: the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> which the Messengers came with. And that means: worshipping Allaah alone, and associating no partner with Him; and that is the straight and true Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, along with this, He set up evidences proving His Lordship, from that which they witness in themselves with regard to the amazing way in which they have been created and in the amazing signs which are a proof for the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High. And likewise, He set up for them, in front of them, in the heavens and the earth and in the created beings, that which is a proof for the Creator. For indeed these created things must have a Creator; they could not have just appeared or come about without a Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Is it that they were created by nothing, or are they the ones who created? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? No, they do not have certainty.</span></em> (Sooratu<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>oor (52), <em>aayaat </em>35-36)[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                فيا عجبًا كيف يعصى الإله             أم كيف يجحده الجاحد</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                وفي كل شيء له آيـــة                     تدل على أنه واحـــد</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So how amazing – how can the One deserving of all worship be disobeyed</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                                    Or how can the obstinate denier deny Him</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                        When every single thing contains an evidence for Him</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Proving that He is One!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything in front of you proves the Unity of Allaah and bears witness that He is alone in having created all these created things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those things which you call upon besides Allaah could never create a fly, even if they gathered together to do it.</span></em> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Creator is Allaah, the Perfect. No one creates along with Him. So therefore, how can something else besides Him be worshipped, from those things which do not create and do not provide provision, and do not possess the ability to bring benefit for themselves nor harm?! So the meaning of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ‘witnessing’ of this <em>aayah</em> refers to the witness of the correct inborn nature, and the witness of the created beings to the Unity of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there is no possibility for anyone to have an excuse on the Day of Resurrection, and therefore say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>We were unaware of this</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, using blind-following of others is not correct in the face of decisive proofs and clear evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [85][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa,</em> from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Allaah took the covenant (mee<u>th</u>aaq) from the back of Aadam `alayhis-salaam at Na`maan – meaning `Arafah – so He took out from his backbone every one of his descendants whom He was going to produce, and spread them out in front of Him, then He spoke to them and said, ‘Am I not your Lord?’ So they said, ‘Yes, indeed we bear witness…’ the aayaat until ‘…those who call upon other than Allaah’.”</em></strong> (Sooratul-`Araaf (7), 172-173).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-<u>H</u>aakim and he declared it authentic, and A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>ahabee agreed and Al-Hay<u>th</u>amee said, “Its narrators are those of the <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>” and its chain of narration was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> A<u>h</u>mad <u>Sh</u>aakir in his checking of the Musnad, and the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah, no. 1623.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, who said, “The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no child who is born except that he is born upon the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> (natural way of Islaam). And then his parents turn him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian. It is just like when an animal gives birth to a baby animal &#8211; do you find it mutilated?’” Then Aboo Hurayrah recited the <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>The natural way upon which Allaah created the people. </em></span><strong><br />
</strong>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1358.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: Regarding these <em>aayaat</em>, the great <em>Mufassir</em>, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Naa<u>s</u>ir As-Sa`dee, points out the way in which these <em>aayaat</em> are an evidence (in his <em>Tafseer</em>) and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence upon them, using an affair which does not enable them (those who deny Allaah) to do anything except to submit to the truth, or to depart from what is necessitated by the intellect and the Religion. An explanation of that is to say that those people who deny Allaah’s sole right to worship, and who deny His Messenger, that this necessitates their denying that Allaah created them. And it is confirmed in the intellect, along with the Legislation, that the affair cannot escape one of three affairs: either they were created by nothing, meaning that they have no Creator who created them; rather, they came about not having been brought into existence, and having nothing that brought them into existence; this is something impossible. Or, they are the creators of themselves, and this is also impossible because it cannot be imagined that something has produced itself. So, when these two affairs are nullified and are clearly impossible, then the third matter becomes certain &#8211; that it is Allaah who created them. And when that becomes certain, then it becomes known that Allaah, the Most High, He is therefore, the One alone who deserves to be worshipped and that He is the One for whom worship is right and befitting, and it is not right or befitting for anyone besides Him, He the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> takes the view of those who explain the <em>aayah</em> (<strong>And He caused them to witness upon themselves, “Am I not your Lord?” So they said, “Yes indeed!”</strong> – Al-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 172) to refer to the inborn nature that Allaah has placed in the people, and that it doesn’t refer to the taking out of the souls of the descendants of Aadam from him and their being verbally asked to bear witness. As he indicated, there are some people who held that (view). In that regard, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> was one of those who held the other view – that the <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf and the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and this <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> is one and the same thing. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee refutes those who disagree with that, and you will find it in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah, Volume 4, pages 161-162 thereabouts, under <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1623. Part of what he mentions, is that he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Anbaaree said, “The position of the people of <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and the major ones from the people of knowledge, hold that this <em>aayah</em> means that Allaah took out the descendants of Aadam from his back and then from the backs of his descendants. And they were in the form of little ants and then He took from them the covenant (<em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em>) that He is their Creator and that they are created beings. So they bore witness to that and accepted it, and this was after intellect had been given to them which enabled them to understand what was presented to them – just as happened to the mountain when it was addressed – intellect was given to it, and the camel when it prostrated, and the palm tree when it was heard.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he (Ibn Al-Anbaaree) quoted from Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahawayh, that he said, “The people of knowledge agreed that Allaah created the souls before the bodies and that He caused them to speak and bear witness.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee goes on to explain that there is no contradiction between this <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf and between the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa, </em>and there is no reason that we should take it to be anything except what is apparent from it – that it refers to Allaah extracting the descendants of Aadam from his back and causing them to bear witness to this covenant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, there is also mention by Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee in Ma`aarij Al-Qabool (معارج القبول). He mentioned the same thing as well – that there is no contradiction between these two. And Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee mentioned that the covenants are actually three (3) covenants. The first covenant is when the people were taken from the back of Aadam and they bore witness to His Unity, and to the fact that none has the right to be worshipped besides Him. Then the second covenant that he mentions, is the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> – as was referred to in the <em>aayah</em> from Sooratur-Room. And the third covenant is what the Messengers came with – that Allaah sent the Messengers ordering the people and commanding the people to worship Allaah alone; and that third one is what establishes Allaah’s proof upon the creation. Then Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee said, “So there is no contraction between any of these; rather, they are all confirmed by the Book and the Sunnah.” And he mentioned, “And as for the saying that this <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf refers to the covenant, and that the descendants of Aadam were taken from his back and bore witness, then that was the saying of the great majority of the people of <em>Tafseer</em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahumullaah</em>).” Wallaahu A`lam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Hawd &amp; The Kawthar (The Pool &amp; The River)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] They believe in the Hawd [102] and the Kawthar. Also in the entering of a group of Ahl ut-Tawheed into Paradise without account. There will also be a group from them who will have an easy reckoning, without any harm befalling them, or any punishment overtaking them. A group from them who had sinned will enter the Fire, then they will be freed and led out of it and joined up with their brothers who preceded them in entering Paradise. [103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They ( i.e. Ahl Hadeeth ) know with certainty and truth that the sinful from amongst the Ahl ut Tawlieed will not remain in the Fire eternally, and will not be left there forever. [104] As for the unbelievers, they shall abide in Hell forever and never come out of it nor shall they ever be reprieved. Allaah will never leave in the Fire anyone, who was disobedient from Ahl ul-Eemaan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh. I saw that he was strong in Salafi Tawheed, so I sat there until the Adhan of Isha. Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘<strong>O Shaykh how did you learn Tawheed?</strong>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: your question is excellent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: Salafiyoon are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a Salafi, so how did Salafeeyah come to you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it. He began explaining the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf to me. He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The First Verse:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers.</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear is one of the most dignified and important religious principles. Fear of Allah summarizes all forms of worship which must be made solely and sincerely for Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says (about His messengers):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they, from fearing Him, are frightened.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (تعالى ) says (about the angels):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">They fear their Lord above them.</span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (تعالى ) says (about the believers):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">But whoever has feared standing before his Lord will have two gardens</span>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So fear only Me.</span>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not fear people, but fear Me.</span> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many verses in the Quran similar to these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fear of other than Allah can be divided into three types.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The first type of fear is an inward, spiritual fear. This type is the religious fear one has of other than Allah such as fearing idols and false gods, being afraid that they may afflict him with something he dislikes. An example is the verse in which Allah narrated that the people of Prophet Hūd said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">“We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “Indeed, I call Allah to witness, and you witness yourselves, that I am free from whatever you associate with Allah.”</span> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about this type of fear:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they threaten you with those (they worship) other than Him.</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the same type of fear those who worship grave inhabitants have as well as idol worshippers; such people fear these false gods. They threaten the people who believe only in Allah with the punishment of such false deities when the believers criticize their misplaced worship, encouraging them to instead sincerely worship Allah alone. This type of fear completely invalidates tawḥīd – the worship of Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The second type of fearing others besides Allah is when one chooses not to do what he is religiously obligated to do out of fear of other people. This type of fear is impermissible and it is a form of associating others with Allah which contradicts complete tawḥīd. And it is this type of fear for which the opening verse was revealed; Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those to whom hypocrites said, “The people have certainly gathered against you, so fear them.” But it (only) increased them in faith and they said, “Sufficient for us is Allah and (He is) the best disposer of affairs.” So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them. They pursued the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty. That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers.</span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, in a ḥadīth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah (تعالى ) will ask a worshipper on the Day of Resurrection, “What prevented you, when you saw some wrongdoing, from changing it?” The person will answer, “My Lord, the fear of people.” He will say, “I was more deserving that you fear Me.”</span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The third type of fearing others besides Allah is the natural fear. It is the instinctive fear of an enemy, a wild animal, or similar things. There is nothing wrong with this type of fear as Allah (تعالى ) said relaying the story of Prophet Mūsá ( عليه السلام) :</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So he escaped it (the city), fearful and anticipating (apprehension). He said, “My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.”</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of &#8220;That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters&#8221; in the opening verse,12 it means he tries to make you afraid of his allies. And as for &#8220;So do not fear them, but fear Me&#8221;, this is a commandment from Allah (تعالى ) to believers that they must not fear others besides Him. It is an order that they should limit their emotion of fear to Allah alone, fearing none other. This is the complete sincerity and devotion Allah requires from his worshippers and with which He is pleased. So when they ensure their fear is for none other than Allah, as well as all other aspects of worship, He will in return give them what they hope for and keep them safe and secure from the fears of this life and the hereafter as He (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? And yet they threaten you with other than Him.</span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله  تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of the plot of the enemy of Allah is that he tries to frighten believers with his soldiers and supporters. He does so in order that the believers will be too scared to oppose and strive against them, too scared to encourage his supporters to do good or forbid them from doing evil. As such, Allah, the Most High, informs us that this is all part of the plot and deception of Satan and his intimidation and frightening (of believers). Yet He has forbidden us from fearing them by saying—and this is the interpretation of most interpreters—that Satan is only trying to make the believers scared of his supporters. Qatādah says, “He (Satan) makes them (his supporters) seem greater, more significant in the believer’s hearts.” So whenever a worshipper’s faith in Allah becomes stronger, the fear of Satan’s supporters becomes less, and when his faith weakens, his fear of them becomes greater. Therefore, this verse shows that sincerity in fear is one of the conditions of complete faith.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Second Verse</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and give charity and fear none other besides Allah. It is expected that those will be of the rightly guided.</span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, Allah tells us the mosques of Allah are to be maintained only by people of faith in Allah and the last day (the Day of Judgment). They are those who both believe with their hearts and worship with their limbs, and they make their fear sincerely and exclusively for Allah and no other. For these, He has confirmed the maintenance of places of worship after He forbade it for those who worship others besides Him. This is because the establishment and care of such places of worship is to be done with obedience (to Allah) and righteous actions. As for one who worships other than Allah, even if he were to perform a seemingly righteous action:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Their deeds are like a mirage in a desert which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah before him.</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Or:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">Their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day.</span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Considering that, true goodness does not result from such action or person. So places of worship, the mosques, should be maintained and populated with only true faith, the most dignified of which is tawḥīd and righteous deeds free of all forms of deficiency such as the worship of other than Allah and unfounded religious innovation. All of that is included in the meaning of the word “faith” (īmān) according to mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About &#8220;and (they) fear none other besides Allah&#8221; in the verse, Ibn ‘Aṭiyyah says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It means the type of fear which is based on honor, worship, and obedience. And while it may be inevitable that people are afraid of worldly dangers, they must ultimately fear the decree and control of Allah alone regarding (the consequences) of such worldly dangers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Fear is worship of the heart, and it is not fitting to be given to others besides Allah, similar to repentance, love, reliance, hope, and other aspects of worship of the heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;It is expected that those will be of the rightly guided&#8221;, Ibn Abī Ṭalḥah reported that Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ) ماsaid, “He is saying, ‘They are the rightly guided.’ Any time the Arabic word ‘( عَسَىasá – “perhaps,” “it is expected,” etc.) is used in the Quran, it means it is something destined to happen.” [17]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The Third Verse</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And of mankind are some who say, “We believe in Allah.” But if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as (if it were equal to) the punishment of Allah.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Kathīr ( رحمه الله ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) informs us about the characteristics of some people who dishonestly claim to believe, but their belief is only with their tongues and not firm in their hearts. For such people, when a trial or tribulation comes to them in this life, they believe it is from the resentment and wrath of Allah and then leave Islam. Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ما ) said, “It becomes a tribulation from which he leaves his religion when harmed for the sake of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people are sent a messenger, they become one of two types of individuals: those who respond, “I believe,” and those who do not. Those who refuse continue on with their sin and disbelief. As for he who says he believes, he is then tested by his Lord with trial and affliction; the affliction is only a test however. This is to distinguish the truthful from the untruthful. As for those who do not believe (in the messenger), he should not think that Allah is incapable (of testing him), or that he will escape from Him. As a consequence, whoever believes in the messengers and obeys them, the messengers’ enemies will begin to show enmity toward him and afflict him with whatever will harm him (in this life). And those who neither believe in the messengers nor obey them, they will be recompensed in this life and in the hereafter and will still eventually experience what harms them. Yet their harm is greater and more lasting than that experienced in life by the messenger’s followers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even though every soul will experience some type of harm, whether it believes or refuses belief, a believer is hurt in this life only as a trial for him then he will be rewarded for it both in this life and in the hereafter. But he who refuses to believe, he may experience his delight in this life, again only as a trial for him, then he experiences a permanent harm and everlasting pain (in the hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone must live among others and people have their own ideas and plans. People want other individuals to agree and conform to them in their plans. If one does not agree with them, choosing instead to contradict them, they seek to harm and punish him. Even if he were to conform to them, he would still be harmed, sometimes by the very people he agrees with, sometimes by others. For example, if a person of religion who is conscientious of Allah is among sinful or oppressive people, he may feel he has no way of escaping their wickedness and oppression except by either agreeing and conforming to what they are upon or at least by remaining silent regarding their evil. Were he to support them or remain silent, he may save himself from their evil and tribulations. But they will then have gained influence and power over him, humiliating him and perhaps harming him with affliction even greater than he had feared had he criticized them and differed from them. Even if he were safe from them, he may simply be humiliated and harmed by other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution is to remember what the Mother of the Believers, ‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنها ), said to Muā’wiyah ( رضي الله عنه ): Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah guides an individual, inspiring within him His guidance and saving him from the evil of his own soul, such a person would refuse to support and agree with others in sinful acts. He would patiently bear whatever enmity they show him for it. He will then have his reward in this life and the hereafter as did the messengers and their followers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) then informs us about those who enter the faith without true insight. When he is harmed for the sake of Allah, he considers the tribulation of people—and it is the hurt he feels from them and their hatred which the messengers and their followers always experience from those who oppose them—he makes such tribulation of people, by his fleeing from it and avoiding whatever upsets them, equal to the punishment of Allah from which believers should more rightfully flee with true faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">True believers with complete insight, however, flee from the punishment of Allah toward belief in Him. They bear patiently with whatever temporary harm they may suffer (from people) for Him, harm from which they will soon escape. But the other individual (who refuses to differ from sinful people), from his weak insight and unclear understanding of faith, flees from the harm of those who oppose the messengers toward agreeing with them and following them. In doing so, he flees from the punishment of people and into the punishment of Allah. He equates the harm of people, by his action of fleeing from it in what angers Allah, with the punishment of Allah. How unbefitting it is that he seeks safety and refuge (from people’s harm) in the scorching fire, running away from the pain of an hour to the pain of eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in this verse is a refutation of the Murjiah Karrāmiyah sect (who claim that merely expressing faith with the tongue is sufficient to be saved). This is because such peoples’ statement, “We believe in Allah,” as mentioned in the verse, did not benefit them when they refused to patiently bear the harm of those who would hurt them for the sake of Allah. So proclaiming faith alone is of no benefit without actions. True religious faith of any person is only correct when it combines three aspects: belief in the heart and its actions (emotions in accordance with faith), statements with the tongue, and actions with the limbs. That is the position of all mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah, past and present, and Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such action (conforming to sinfulness, refusing to differ from it) is a form of flattering the creation despite the truth, and the only one saved from such action is one whom Allah saves.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.”</span> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ḥibbān recorded this ḥadīth with that wording and al-Tirmidhī recorded it by way of a man from Medina who said that Mu’āwiyah ( رضي الله عنه ) wrote to ‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنها) : “Write and advise me but be concise.” She replied, greeting him with “Peace be on you,” then wrote that she heard the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say, “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholar of Islam (Ibn Taymiyyah) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Āishah wrote this ḥadīth to Mu’āwiyah and it has been reported from her in a marfū’ form [21] that she said, “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, they will not protect him from Allah in any way.” That is the marfū’ form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been reported in a mawqūf form [22] that she said, “Whoever pleases Allah at the expense of angering people, Allah will be pleased with him and cause people to be pleased with him too. But whoever pleases people at the expense of angering Allah, He will make those who praise him revert back to criticizing him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the greatest understanding of religion. Whoever seeks to please Allah, even if it means angering people, he has rightfully feared Allah and has become His righteous worshipper. Allah in return assumes the responsibility of protecting the righteous and He is sufficient for his worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever fears Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine</span>.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah will certainly suffice him from having to rely on people. As for trying to please all people, that is impossible anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for, “seeking the pleasure of people by angering Allah,” in doing this, the person gives preference to people’s acceptance and happiness over that of Allah. This happens when the honor and respect for Allah and His greatness has not settled in his heart. If it had, it would have prevented him from seeking to gain the pleasure of the creation by gaining the anger of his creator, his Lord, and owner – the very One who controls all hearts, removes all difficulties, and forgives all sins. Based on this, such a choice (preferring to please people by angering Allah) is a form of associating others in worship with Allah because he considers pleasing the creation a higher priority than pleasing Allah. He seeks to get closer to creation by way of displeasing Allah. And no one is saved from this except one whom Allah saves and for whom He gives the success of truly knowing Him. This is attained by knowing what befits Allah by believing in His characteristics and rejecting any false notions which reduce His perfection and knowing tawḥīd of His lordship and sole right to worship. With Allah alone is success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab ( رحمه الله ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one realizes that anyone of creation on earth—and the earth is merely dirt—is himself (created) from dirt, then why would someone give preference to obeying someone from dirt over obeying the Lord of lords? How can he please dirt by angering the Owner, the Bestower? That is certainly an amazing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, there is a severe reprimand for whoever fears people, preferring their acceptance and pleasure over Allah. And perhaps his punishment for doing so may even be a test or affliction in his religion—we seek refuge with Allah from that—as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So He punished them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they will meet Him because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they used to lie</span>. [24]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Reading Star Signs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Alaa ash &#8211; Shaykh -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whoever reads the page which contains star signs and he knows the star sign of when he was born, or he knows that star sign which is significant for him, and he reads the comments mentioned in that star sign then it is as if he has asked a soothsayer/fortune teller. So his prayer would not be accepted for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he attests to it and believes in that star sign then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- . . .&#8217; (the Shaykh continues saying: ) &#8216;and if he brings home newspapers which contain these type of things then it is as if he brought a soothsayer / fortune teller into his house.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tamheed Sharh Kitaab al Tawheed p. 349 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211; Watching Magical Acrobatic Stunts &amp; Circus Antics </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzaan -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not permissible to use magic in the form of acrobatic stunts or circus antics or anything similar to that. Like the one who pulls a car with his hair, or a car is driven over him and does not harm him. . . . . all of this is magical imagery, so it is not allowed to perform it or to be happy with it, nor to attract your friends to do this in front of Muslims. Because it is clear evil, it is obligatory to reject and terminate it and to cleanse the Muslim lands of it . . . if those who go to see magic in the form of acrobatic stunts even though they are not pleased with going to see them, they have carried out something which is prohibited and they are sinful for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they are pleased with this and they know that this is done by magic then they have fallen into disbelief because of it.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Daroos fee sharh Nawaqid al Islaam p. 152-156]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Wearing an Engagement Ring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This enters under the saying of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Indeed incantations, amulets and Tiwalah [1] (a form of magic) are Shirk.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen -rahimullaah &#8211; gave the example that an engagement ring is a Tiwalah and he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If the people believe that it can benefit or harm, then with this intention it is from the minor Shirk, and even if this intention is not there &#8211; and this is highly unlikely that he does not have this intention &#8211; it is resemblance of the Christians since it is taken from them.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ala Kitaab al Tawheed 1 /228-229]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Wearing Brass Bracelets to Battle Against Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdulAziz Ibn Baz &#8211; rahimullaah &#8211; said regarding these type of bracelets after having exhausted all the evidences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The opinion which I hold in this issue is leaving these previously mentioned bracelets and not to use them; this is to block the path leading to Shirk, to terminate the aspect of any Fitnah with these bracelets and to incline to them, also that souls become attached to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in having the incentive in turning the Muslim with his heart to Allaah -Subhanahu- and to have trust in Him, and reliance on Him sufficing with the means which are in accordance with the Sharia&#8217; and their allowance is well known with committing Shirk.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo&#8217; Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz vol.1 p.207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Neither Wealthy, Nor Knowledge of the Unseen, Nor an Angel<br />
By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ لَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَى إِلَيَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Soorah Ana’am : 50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was ordered to free himself from claiming these three things with Allaah’s statement &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say : ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; This is also what Nuh -alayhi as-Salam- said and he was the first of the main Messengers, the first Messenger&nbsp;[1] whom Allaah Ta’ala sent to the people of the earth. Here, too now, is the seal of the Messengers and the seal of the main Messengers and they have both freed themselves from this claim. This is because people sometimes seek knowledge of the unseen from the Messenger–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, as in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">They say: “When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass? if you are telling the truth.”</span> </strong>&gt;&gt; [Mulk:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone)</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Aa’raaf: 187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also they sometimes seek this knowledge to be persuaded of the truth, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا () أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ الْأَنْهَارَ خِلَالَهَا تَفْجِيرًا () أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَاءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ قَبِيلًا () أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِنْ زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَى فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنْتُ إِلَّا بَشَرًا رَسُولًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">And they say: “We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; “Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly; “Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allaah and the angels before (us) face to face; “Or you have a house of adornable materials (like silver and pure gold, etc.), or you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read.” Say : “Glorified (and Exalted) be my Lord (Allaah) above all that evil they (polytheists) associate with Him! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger?”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [al-Israa: 90-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes, they would regard the human need a Messenger had as shameful, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا مَالِ هَذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِي فِي الْأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيرًا () أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they say: “Why does this Messenger eat food, and walk about in the markets (like ourselves). Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him? “Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat?”</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Furqan : 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah ordered the Messenger to inform them that he neither knew the unseen, nor did he possess the treasures of Allaah, nor was he an Angel who was not in need of eating or wealth. Rather, he was a follower of what was revealed to him, following that which was revealed to him is the Deen, which is obedience to Allaah and he was commanded to worship Him with knowledge and actions, both inward and outward. A person attains from those three things, according to the amount Allaah Ta’ala gives him. He learns from him what He has taught him and has ability according to what Allaah gives him the capability to do, and he suffices himself with that which Allaah enriched him with in matters which would otherwise oppose general practices or the practice of the majority of the people.’</p>

<p>Posted from: <strong><a title="Beneficial Sayings from Kitaab ut-Tawheed – Dr. Saleh as Saleh [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/beneficial-sayings-from-kitaab-ut-tawheed-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">The Beneficial Saying on The Book of Tawheed</a><br />
</strong>Book by Shaykh Muhammaad bin AbdulWahhaab at-Tamimi rahimahullaah,<br />
Explanation is based upon that of <strong>Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> rahimahullaah</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p><em>The below is posted from the book by dar-us-salam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">CHAPTER No: 7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To wear a Ring, Twine, or anything similar to them for prevention or lifting of Harm or Affliction, is an act of Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Tell me then, the things that you invoke besides Allah, -if Allah intended some harm for me, could they remove His harm, or if He (Allah) intended some mercy for me, could they withhold His Mercy? Say: Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him those who trust (i.e. believers) must put their trust.&#8221;</strong> </span>(39:38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) once saw a man with a brass ring on his hand and asked him, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;To overcome the weakness of old age.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Remove it, for, it can only add to your weakness. Should death overtake you while you are wearing it, you would never succeed.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This Hadith was recorded by Ahmad (bin Hanbal) (May Allah be pleased with him) with a good chain of narrators.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also recorded a Marfu’ Hadith; Uqbah bin Aamir (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Prophet Muhammad (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever wears talisman or an amulet would never see his wish fulfilled by Allah. And whoever hangs a sea shell would never get peace and rest.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an another version the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever wears a talisman has committed Shirk (polytheism).&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported about Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> He saw a man with a piece of twine on his hand (as a protection or cure from fever) so he cut the twine and read the verse: &#8220;Most of them believe in Allah and still practise Shirk (polytheism).&#8221;</strong></span> (12: 106)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 17727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some Arab newspapers and magazines dedicate pages to the horoscope, talking about zodiac signs such as Aries, Taurus, Gemini and others. They claim that people born under these signs will probably be moody because the zodiac conflicts a lot during this period. There are many things written in these pages, a copy of which is attached to the message and many Muslim youth read them. Please clarify the Islamic ruling on zodiac signs and your advice to Muslims and to those responsible for the magazines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is considered the same as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>divination</strong> </span>used by fortune-tellers to inform people if they will be happy or miserable and if they should be optimistic or pessimistic. This is a prohibited idea dating back to the days of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance). It is not permissible to practice, follow or spread these ideas. It is even more misleading and misguiding to Muslims to spread such ideas in newspapers, as they involve claiming to know Ghayb (the Unseen), which is the sole Right of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected</strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 59]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah even denied that His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) knew the Ghayb. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): </span>I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allâh, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.</strong>&#8221; <strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>Are the blind and the one who sees equal? Will you not then take thought?</strong>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And I do not say to you that with me are the Treasures of Allâh, nor that I know the Ghaib (Unseen), nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allâh will not bestow any good on them. Allâh knows what is in their inner-selves (as regards belief, etc.). In that case, I should, indeed be one of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, oppressors).&#8221;</strong> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Hud, 11: 31]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who acquires a branch of the knowledge of astrology has acquired a branch of magic (of which they acquire more as long as) they continue to do so.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths in this regard. Muslim scholars unanimously agree on this well-established ruling prohibiting astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Thus, it is the duty of every Muslim seeking the best for themselves and their religion to avoid this form of manipulating people&#8217;s minds and beliefs, to fear Allah regarding themselves and their nation and not to spread misleading ideas among Muslims</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>On the other hand, Muslim rulers (may Allah grant them success) should prevent this practice and punish those who spread it according to the Islamic prescribed punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>20 &#8211; Exiting from the Fire for those who Worshipped Allaah Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">225 – When the believers will have finished from the fire on the Day of Judgment and become secure. Then one of you arguing for the truth, in the Duniya for his companion will not be more intense than the debating of the believers with their Lord, regarding their brothers whom had been entered into the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: they will say:<strong> Our Lord! These are our brothers they used to pray along with us, and fast along with us, and perform the Hajj along with us, and you have entered them into the fire</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: that Allaah will say: &#8220;go and take out those whom you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will come to them, and they will know them by their faces. The fire would not have eaten their faces. From amongst them there will be, he whom the fire has reached half way up his shins, and he whom the fire has reached to his ankles, and they will take them out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will say: &#8220;We took out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: &#8220;Take out he who has the weight of a dirham of Emaan in his heart. Then the one who has the weight of half a dirham,&#8217; until He says: He who has an atom’s weight in his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;eed said: whoever does not believe this, then let him read this Ayaah : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allaah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from him a great reward</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: The Believers will say: &#8220;O our Lord! Indeed we have taken out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8217; Then there will not remain anyone in the fire who has good in himself.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Then Allaah will say: the Angels have interceded, and the Prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded and The Most Merciful of those who shows mercy remains.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said : Then Allaah will grab a handful from the fire &#8211; or He said : two handfuls &#8211; of people who never did any good for Allaah at all, indeed they will be burnt so much that they will have become charcoal.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: they will be brought to water, which is said to be called the water of life. It will be poured on them they will sprout out like the seed sprouts after what is left over by the torrential floods, they will come out of their bodies like pearls, and they will have a stamp on their necks, saying: those freed by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: it will be said to them: Enter into Paradise, whatever you wish for or anything you see then it is for you, and I have something with Me which is better than that. He said: They will say: Our Lord! What can be better than this?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Allaah will say: My being pleased with you, I will never be angry with you.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1661- &#8220;Indeed Allaah Azza wa Jal will take out a people from the fire after nothing remains of them except for their faces and Allaah will enter them into Paradise.&#8221; The hadeeth is in saheeh al-Bukhari (4/463-464) by a different narration on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed in a narration ascribed to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and he mentions the whole of the hadeeth of the intercession; and in it, is stated: &#8220;Allaah Ta&#8217;aala will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Go to those whom you find in their hearts the equivalent to a dinar of Emaan and take them out of the fire, Allaah prohibits the fire from their faces…</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1450 &#8211; &#8220;Take out of the fire whoever has in his heart the equivalent of an atom worth of Emaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1451- &#8220;Some people from the people of Tawheed will be punished in the fire, until they will be like charcoal, then mercy will reach them. They will be taken out and thrown at the doors of Paradise. He said: then the people of Paradise will sprinkle water upon them, they will sprout like seeds left over, sprouts after the torrential floods, then they will enter paradise.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>22- The Covenant that Allaah Took from His Slaves</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>172- “Allaah will say to the one who has been punished the least from the people of the Hell-fire on the Day of Judgment: ‘O son of Adam! How have you found your resting place?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: ’An evil resting place!’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>It will be said to him: ‘If you had the world and everything in it, would you ransom yourself with it?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: Yes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah will say: You have lied, what I wanted from you was less than that, while you were in the spine (and in another narration: in the back) of Adam, that you do not associate anything with Me, and I will not enter you into the fire, but you refused and committed Shirk. He will be ordered to be taken to the fire.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Regarding this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘He will say: you have lied.’</strong></span> An-Nawawee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It means: If We returned you to the Duniya, you would not have ransomed it, because you were asked for something easier than that but you refused. This will have the same meaning as in the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the meaning of this hadeeth is combined with the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding, His saying: ‘I wanted from you’</strong></span>: i.e. I would have loved from you. When the word ‘Allaah’s Will’ (<strong>al-Irada</strong>) is mentioned in the Sharia&#8217;, it is used in the absolute sense. It means what is general both from the good and the bad, guidance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islaam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his heart closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky</span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is that which will most definitely happen. Sometimes when this Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is applied it means, that which is the synonym of love and being pleased. As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the meaning of the intent of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala in this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I wanted from you’ i.e. that I loved from you. The Will of Allaah (al-Irada) with this meaning might not happen, since Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala does not force anyone to obey Him, even though He created them because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore Allaah Tabarak wa Ta’ala could want from His slave that what Allaah does not love from His slave, and Allaah loves from His slave that which His slave does not want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; called this Will of Allaah (alIrada) a will of the order of being (al-Irada), taking that from the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called the other Will (al-Irada) which is a synonym for &#8216;being pleased&#8217;: the Sharia&#8217; Will (al-Irada).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever understands this division, then he has a solution to many of the problems of understanding the issues of <strong>al-Qadaa</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s ordainment of everything in creation) and <strong>al-Qadr</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s Pre-decree for the creation). And he will succeed from the fitna (tribulations) of the stance of those who say that a person does actions under force, or who hold the beliefs of the Mu&#8217;tazilah. The explanation of this can be found in the magnificent book ‘Shifaa’ al-Aleel al-Qadaa wal-Qadr wal-Hikmaah wa Ta’aleel’ by Ibn al-Qayyim -May Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘……. and you were in the spine of Adam.’</strong></span> Qadi Iyaad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger indicates to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam&#8217;s loin his offspring)</span>&gt;&gt;, in the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covenant was taken from them while they were in the spine of Adam. So, whoever fulfills it after he is brought into this world then he is a believer, and whoever does not fulfill it, is a Kaffir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the intent of this hadeeth is: I wanted from you when I took the covenant, but you refused so I took you to the Duniya but you committed Shirk.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is mentioned in &#8216;al-Fath&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It is known that many people are pessimistic about the month of Safar regarding many affairs. Such people, for example, do not conclude <strong>marriage contracts</strong> during Safar. Moreover, many people believe that it is not permissible to <strong>break a stick, knot ropes, or entwine fingers</strong> when concluding a marriage contract for this leads to failure of the concerned marriage and disharmony between the spouses. Since all the foregoing are beliefs bearing on ‘Aqidah (creed), could you please advise and clarify the ruling on it? May Allah guide us all to all that He loves and is pleased with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pessimism about Safar is not permissible. It is a characteristic of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safar &#8211; just like all other months &#8211; does not bring good or evil, as good is only from Allah (Glorified be He) and evil is predestined by Him. Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) annulled the concept of pessimism when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no ‘Adwa (contagion, disease transmission naturally by itself not by the Decree of Allah), nor is there any Tiyarah (evil omen), nor is there any Hamah (pre-Islamic superstitious belief that the bones of a dead person turn into an owl), nor is there Safar (the month of Safar was believed to bring bad luck during Jahiliyyah).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to pessimism about entwining fingers, breaking a stick, etc., when concluding a marriage contract. Such beliefs are false, baseless, and thus they should not be adopted by a Muslim. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>About the English Book:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Author: </b>Dr. Salih al Fawzan<br />
<b>Publisher: </b>Al Maiman Publishing House (2009)<br />
<b>Pages: </b>493 <b>Binding: </b>Hardcover</p>
<p><b>Description from the publisher: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book gives a clear explanation of the Muslim sound Creed which is the core of the religion of Islam, as the belief in Tawhid (monotheism) is the purpose for which Allah created both mankind and jinn, and thus, those whose belief in Tawhid is corrupt, are not considered Muslims. It is a commentary on the Book of Tawhid written by Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Dr. Salih al Fawzan has projected light on doctrinal issues of utmost importance in a genuine and reader-friendly style. This translated version of the book fulfills a long-standing need on the part of English-speaking Muslims for a brief, introductory book in Tawhid. It is a valuable book for novice readers, be they Muslims or non-Muslims, who do not have thorough knowledge of the sound creed, The chapters of this book focus on major issues in Tawhid such as the definition of Tawhid, virtue of Tawhid, warning against acts of shirk (polytheism), the Prophet’s Maintenance of monotheism, and other topics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Part-Concepts and Practices of Soofism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(A) In Reference to Tawheed of Allaah, the Most High.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed) means to single out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of affairs, with all worship, and with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself or upon the tongue of His Messenger and as they befit His Magnificence. The proof of this is in many texts from the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. One of them is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">[Allaah is] the Rabb of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, Ar-Rahmaan (the one whose Mercy encompasses everything), so worship him alone and be patient and firm on his worship, do you know of any who is similar to Him?</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam, 19:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Tawheed centers upon three types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-<strong>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Tawheed of Lordship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of Affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-<strong>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Tawheed of Worship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with all worship such that no kind of worship could be offered to anyone or anything besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-<strong>Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat:</strong> Singling out Allaah with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself in His Book, or upon the tongue of His Messenger. So the believer affirms what Allaah has affirmed for Himself, and denying whatever He has denied from Himself, without Tahreef (changing and distorting their meanings), without Ta’teel (denying or divesting Allaah of His Attributes), without Takyeef (describing how they are), and without Tamtheel (likening them to those of His creation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">This true belief in Tawheed is not the “Tawheed” of the foremost Soofis. Their Tawheed reflects different creeds and is considered by many as “hidden knowledge” which may be only attained by the elite:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>01 &#8211; Al-Hulool:[13] In mystic Soofism it refers to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Divine incarnation</span> in the so-called Soofee saints.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn Taymeeyah classified the <strong>Hulool</strong> into two kinds. The first is the specific hulool like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eessa (alayhi assaalm) and like that of the extremist Shee’ah and Soofee mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (radhi Allahu anhu) and in special Soofee saints, respectively. The second kind is the general Hulool and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [14] <span id="more-34648"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the most daring Soofis who held to the concept of incarnation was <strong>Al-Hallaaj</strong> [15] who was tried for his heresy and put to death by the ‘Abbaasid authorities. Ibn ‘Ajeebah (1224 AH/1809 C.E.), one of the leading Soofis who explained the Hikam of the mystic Ibn ‘Ataa (d. 709AH/1309 C.E.) related that Al-Hallaj said: “<em>I am You without doubt Subhaanak is Subhaanee. Your Tawheed is my Tawheed and disobeying You is disobeying me. Glorified be He whom his Naassoot (creation, human qualities) made manifest the secret of His shining and piercing Laahoot (the Divine)</em>.[16] He then appeared in His creation manifested in the image of the one who eats and drinks. Even His creation was able to see Him with their own eyes like the moment an eyebrow sees an eyebrow [emphasizing certitude].” [17] Ibn ‘Ajeebah added, “And because of the unraveling of such matters and other similar ones, Al-Hallaaj, may Allaah be pleased with him! -was killed.”[18] These matters according to Ibn ‘Ajeebah and other mystics should not be disclosed. They are the secrets of their Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>02 &#8211; Some see Allaah as the only existing being. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is stressed by <strong>Al-Ghazaalee</strong>, may Allaah forgive him, in his book <strong>Ihyaa ‘Ulum ad-Deen</strong>. He said: “<em>Anyone who does not see Allaah in everything, then he sees ‘other’ than Him,</em>” and that “<em>The pure Tawheed is to see in everything nothing but Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala.</em>” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of such “Tawheed” is that there is one existing being and that is Allaah. The one who sees an existence other than that of Allaah is the Mushrik (who commits Shirk). Al-Ghazaalee explained the perfect understanding of la ilaaha illa Allaah as: “To see none except the One, the Truth,&#8221; and that this represents the “perfect state of Tawheed!” He referred to a state of “Tawheed,” “witnessed by the sincere ones and which the Soofis call Al-Fanaa’ (annihilation) in Tawheed” as the one in which, “Only One (i.e. Allaah) is seen in the entire existence.” Al- Ghazaalee stresses that the utmost objective of Tawheed is to see, “Al-Kull (everything) not as Katheer (many), but as one,” and that this “represents the objective of the (Soofee) knowledge known as Kashf,” and that, “The secrets of this knowledge should not be recorded in a book.” He defined the Mushrik as the one, “Who affirms the existence of ‘an existence’ besides that of Allaah” and that Allaah is, “The witness and the Witnessed, the one loving dearly and the Beloved, and He is the Shaakir (the one who is thankful) and the Mashkoor (The One Who deserves acknowledgment and recognition)…”[20] This is not true Tawheed in which the believer knows well that Allaah is distinct and separate from His creation, rather this is “Wahdah” (unity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Doctrine of Wahdat Al-Wujud.</strong></span> This is neither <strong>Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in creation) nor <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created), rather it means that every creature that the eye sees is Allaah in essence. This concept of the Unity of Existence is held by many of the so-called Soofee saints (Awliyaa’) like Ibn Al-Faarid (d. 632AH/1235 C.E.), Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 638AH/1240 C.E.), Ibn ‘Sab’een (d. 669 AH/1270 C.E.), Al-‘Afeef At-Tilmisaani (d. 690 AH/1291C.E.), Ibn Masheesh (d. 622 AH/1225 C.E.), An- Nabulusi (d. 1143 AH/1731 C.E.), and others. Under such concept, the presence of creation is an illusion or an imagination. Many Soofis consider Ibn ‘Arabi the Greatest sheikh and the symbol of the concept of Wahdat Al-Wujud. He considers the Soofee who knows of Allaah (‘Aarif billaah) as the one who “Sees Allaah in everything, rather he sees Him the essence of Everything,” [21] and that “He (Allaah) is the Essence of Existence” [22] Ibn ‘Arabi considered all kinds creeds to be true and he believed in them all. This is his “Unity of Worship”: Creatures have held [certain] tenets regarding the Ilaah And I have believed in all of what they have believed in.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “Be careful not to restrict yourself to a particular (or distinct) creed and deny everything else otherwise you would miss a great deal of good. Rather you would miss knowing the matter as it is. So, be within yourself an HexhqKy (Hayouli: A substance) for all the forms of creeds, for Allaah is Greater than being limited by one creed and excluding another.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ibn ‘Arabi contain many statements in which he considers everything worshipped on earth is Allaah [25] and that his heart “turned to accept every image”; it became “a monastery for monks, a home for idols, the Ka’bah of the Taa’if (the one in Tawaaf), the Tablets of the Torah, and the book of the Qur’aan&#8230;” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is only a very brief presentation on the position of mystic Soofism regarding the belief in Allaah Who is High above what they attribute to Him. Imaam Ath-Thahabee rahimahullah said regarding the book of Fusoos Al-Hikam of Ibn ‘Arabi: “If there is no Kufr in it [Fusoos], then there is no Kufr in this world!” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Hulool: lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The submission and obedience of man to His Creator is the essence of Islam. The Name “Islam” is chosen by God (Allaah) and not by man. It is the same message revealed to all the prophets and Messengers by Allaah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its final and universal form it was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم: may Allaah exalt his mention and save him and his message from all kinds of evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the identifying name or title of the Majestic, sole and True God. This noun which is the name of Allaah applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and Most High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name Allaah is the ma’looh (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing). He is the Creator: to Him belongs the Commandment. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Elijas, Malcom’s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Gurus, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too), Diana, light fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), Saints, Priests, Monks, Haile Selassie, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!! All are created beings or things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Allaah is not chosen by man and it is not named after a prophet, saint or any famous man. The name “Allaah” was referred to by all prophets including Adam, Jesus, Moses, and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as the One true God who deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate nature in man (fitrah) recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allaah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes nor does it relax towards associating human qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son”, and that “everyone is born with an original sin”. They “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material world”. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!” not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “origin god” of Rome: The god of desire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete code for life which requires man to fulfill the purpose for his presence on earth. Allaah does not want for man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men, desire, or sex. He provides the proofs that he is the One who can deliver man from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him. He is the Last, everything ends except Him; the Most High, nothing is above Him; the Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach and his compassing, and He is the Most High in His nearness. He is the Ever-Living, to Him we shall all return, where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not beget nor is He begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel (Injeel) as a message to the Children of Israel. A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him. A man who needs to eat, walk, sleep, rest, etc. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need, but Allaah, the God of Jesus, is far above any imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafarianism, etc., all are forms of worship to created beings/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a nationalistic belonging to Allaah: “The Tribal God” of Israel. Men and women following these religions were born with the natural inclination of worshipping their Creator, Allaah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. Once they are exposed to the Signs of Allaah around them, or in the Qur’an, or to someone who triggers their Fitrah (natural inclination to worship Allaah alone), the reverting process begins, and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many distortions of Islam in the media, worldwide. However, Despite the wrong practices of some Muslims (rulers and ruled) in some countries, those who seek the truth are judging Islam according to its doctrines. That is why we continue to witness a global growth in the number of people accepting this true religion of Allaah. The opposition to Islam will intensify with the spread of this truth in the world. This is not a conflict of “civilizations”, but rather the real struggle between the truths presented in the creed and principles of Islam and false doctrines and ways of worship. This is a real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allaah’s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breathe? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? So is it our right to ignore our Creator when we are all need of Him? Allaah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One and only one True God. It is the religion of submission to the Will and Commandment of the One Who brought us to life, the Ever Living who will never die. It is the complete way of life for all mankind. All these qualities are chosen by Allaah in His only religion: Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that you will come with an open heart to read the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, because none can expose the truth better than the Word of Allaah. The Qur&#8217;an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in Arabic and it is not authored by him for he was unlettered. The translations of its meanings into many languages are available in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may want to know how does one become a Muslim. In order to become a Muslim one must openly recite ash-shahaadah (the profession of faith): La ilaaha illallaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah which means that there is no true god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. This means that there is no god worthy of being worshipped but Allaah, and that He must be worshipped only according to the teaching of His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Those teachings are best understood by the Prophet’s companions, and those who rightfully follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. They are called as-salaf as-saalih (the Righteous Predecessors). May Allaah, the Most High, guide us all to this path.</p>

I swear by Allaah there were a people that were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who Allaah will throw on their nostrils in the Hell-Fire, because they did not respond to the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> nor did they believe in him. Do you not praise Allaah, for taking you out from your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything except your Lord and believing in that which your Prophet was sent with. Indeed you have been saved from trials by others being trialed instead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, that Allaah sent the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the severest time that any Prophet from among the Prophets was ever sent, in any period of time including the <em>Jahileeyah</em> time period (period of ignorance before Islaam).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Relation of the Shahaadah with the Types of Tawheed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 5:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">But does the Shahaadah Comprise the Types of Tawheed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Indeed it does encompass the types of Tawheed altogether, either by way of inclusion or implication. This is because a persons statement, “I testify that La ilaaha illallaah,” is immediately understood such that the intended meaning is Tawheed al-’Ibaadah (i.e. to single Allaah out with all worship). This type of Tawheed, also called Tawheed al- Uloohiyyah, is inclusive of Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (i.e. to single Allaah out with Creation, Sovereignty and Control of affairs), because everyone who worships Allaah alone, would not worship Him until he firmly attests that ar-Ruboobiyyh is exclusively His.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also comprises the Tawheed of al-Asmaa’was-Sifaat,[15] because man does not worship except what he knows to be worthy of worship due to the Names and Attributes He has. This is why Ibraaheem said to his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?</em> </span>[Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 42].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Tawheed of al-’Ibaadah, which is Tawheed al- Uloohiyyah, comprises both Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah and that of al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat is to single Allaah out with all of the most beautiful Names and superlative Attributes which He has affirmed for Himself or which His Messenger, Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم has affirmed for Him, without Tahreef (changing or distorting the meaning of the Names and Attributes), without Ta’teel (denying or suspending their meanings), without Takyeef (specifying how they are), and without Tamtheel (exemplification). It also involves denying all that which Allaah has denied from Himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Question 32: </span></strong><strong>What is Soothsaying?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soothsaying or <strong>divination</strong> (<strong>Kihaanah</strong>) is of the measure Fi’aalah and it is derived from <strong>al-Kahn</strong> which means speaking falsely, and searching for the facts in ways that are completely unfounded. This was the practice of some people during the pre-Islamic era (<strong>al-Jaahiliyyah</strong>) and with whom the Shayaateen (the devils) established contact, relating to them the hearing [57] they (the devils) steal from the heaven. Those receiving the hearing take each word and add to it whatever they want from the words of falsehood, then they impart it to the people. If the matter occurs exactly as they said, people will be deceived by them and will take them as authority to which they turn to for judgement and for predicting the future events. That is why we say that the soothsayer is the one who informs about the hidden matters in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one <strong>who visits a soothsayer</strong>, then he may be classified into one of the following three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong></span>: He visits the soothsayer then he<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> asks him without believing him</span></strong>. Then this is legally forbidden, and the punishment assigned to the one who does this is such that prayers extending to forty days will not be accepted from him, as affirmed in the report collected in Saheeh Muslim and in which the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: “<strong><span style="color:#008000;">He who goes to a diviner (soothsayer) and asks him about anything, his prayers extending to forty days or nights will not be accepted.”</span></strong> [58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second</strong></span>: He goes to a Kaahin (soothsayer) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">asks him about anything and believes him in what he tells</span></strong>. This is disbelief in Allaah (Azza wa Jal), because he believed him in his claim of knowing of al-Ghayeb (the hidden andunseen).[59] Believing men in their claim of knowing al-Ghayeb is a denial of the Saying of Allaah, The Most High: <span style="color:#008000;">“<strong>None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayeb (unperceived realities) except Allaah</strong></span>.” [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27):65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And denying what Allaah and His Messenger inform of is Kufr (unbelief). That is why it is mentioned in the authentic transmission:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever goes to a diviner, and believes what he says then he has indeed disbelieved in what was sent down upon Muhammad</span></strong>.” [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: He goes to the fortune-teller and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">asks him about anything in order to expose his situation to the people</span></strong>, and that what he does is merely divination, distortion and misguidance. There is no harm in this. The proof for it is that when the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) encountered<strong> ibn Sayyad</strong> (who claimed prophethood), he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) concealed something for him within himself (to test him), and when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked him about what he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) concealed for him, he said: “It is a Dukh intending AdDukhaan (smoke).” Thereupon the Prophet ((Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)) said: “May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not be able to go beyond your rank.” [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the conditions of those who go to a diviner, and they are three.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that he goes to him not believing in him, nor intending to test and expose him, and this is unlawful. The applicable punishment upon the one who does this is that his prayers will not be accepted from him for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is that he asks him about anything, and believes him. This is unbelief in Allah (Azza wa Jal). It is obligatory upon the person who does this to repent from it, and to return to Allaah (Azza wa Jal). Otherwise, he dies on a state of unbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third situation is such that he goes to the diviner and asks him in order to test him, and expose his reality to the people. In this there is no harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Ruling Regarding Those Who go to Diviners</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 33:</strong> It would be nice if we could know of the status of people who go to fortune-tellers.</p>
<p><strong>The Answer:</strong> Their situations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First Case:</strong> A person goes to the diviner and asks him about anything without believing him, and in doing so he does not intend to expose his reality. Then the person is sinful, and the applicable punishment is that prayers will not be accepted from him for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second Case:</strong> He goes to the fortune-teller and then he asks him and believes him. This person is an unbeliever because he denies the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayeb (unperceived realities) except Allaah.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27): 65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Case:</strong> He goes to him and asks him in order to test him, and expose his status and his lies and falsifying to the people. And we have mentioned that there is no harm in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is a determined matter that if a thing that is legally permissible leads to something forbidden, then itself becomes prohibited. So, if it is determined that in this third case whereby the person goes to the diviner to test him and expose his reality, and as such it may become a reason leading people to be deceived by him–then under such circumstances he should not do that and should not go to him, even if it were to be done for this good intention. Since the rule is that, whatever leads to something prohibited then it is itself, prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: “<span style="color:#008000;">While the angels talk over the clouds about things that are going to happen on the earth [in another narration: “they mention the affairs decreed in heavens”], the devils hear a word of what they say and pour it in the ears of the sooth-sayer as one pours something in a bottle, and they add one-hundred lies to that (one word).”</span> Reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol.4, no.508.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] Reported by Mulsim. See Saheeh Muslim, vol.4, no.5540.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] Al-Ghayeb: The hidden and unseen of all unperceived realities related to Allaah, Paradise, Hell and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Reported by At-Tirmithee, and Ibn Maajah. It was authenticated by Ahmad Shaakir and al-Albaanee (See al-Irwaa’ by al-Albaanee, no.2006).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] The story of Ibn Sayyaad, a diviner, is detailed in Saheeh Muslim (Book of Fitan), Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (Books of Janaa’iz, Jihaad and Siyar, alQadar, al-Adab, and others), At-Tirmithee (Book of Fitan) and by others. In it the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) exposed his claim of Prophethood through this test. He was not able to complete the word Dukhaan pertaining to soorat adDukhaan. The devils imparting the information to Ibn Sayyaad were not able to snatch the complete word, thus it came in this distorted form.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">فتاوى نور على الدرب :Original Title<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5;">Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Sudanese brothers living in the kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) in the city of Bāḥah asks: The people of the Sunnah and the mainstream community of Muslims state that the final destination of those who worship Allah with <em>Tawḥīd</em> – the Muslim monotheists – will eventually be Paradise. Yet there have come examples in some <em>ḥadīth </em>(prophetic narrations) that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ قَاطِعُ رَحْم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ نَمَّامٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“A slanderer will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, will the Muslim monotheists who happen to fall into these two groups never enter Paradise as is apparent from these texts, or how do we understand them?</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts pertaining to threats and others similar to them, whether from <em>ḥadīth</em> or verses of the Qur&#8217;aan, are what led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/">Khawārij</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/">Mu’tazilah</a> </strong>sects to state that anyone who commits a major sin will remain forever in the fire (of Hell). This is because they take these general texts and forget other general ones that conflict (and must be taken along) with these. And there are many proofs that state that Muslim monotheists or those with faith in their hearts even equal to a seed’s worth will not remain in the fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the generality of the texts pertaining to hopes and promises that mention that believers will enter Paradise led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/">Murjiah</a> </strong>sect to disregard the texts of threats. They said that any believer, even if he were a wicked sinner, would never enter the fire. So, these people take only these general texts and those others sects take only the general texts of threats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allah has guided the people of the Sunnah and the main community of Muslims to the middle, moderate belief that combines the understanding of both evidences in conjunction. This belief is that someone who commits a major sin does not thereby completely leave his faith. He may be deserving of punishment but Allah could simply forgive him and not put him into the fire, or perhaps someone else could pray for him and as a result Allah may not punish him. His punishment could also be expiated by other means. However, if no means are present whereby he can avoid punishment, then he may be punished in the fire according to the extent of his action, and after that he would be in Paradise. This is the methodology and understanding of the people of Sunnah and the community of mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, the general <em>ḥadīth</em> of threats like those the questioner mentioned: “<span style="color:#808000;">Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise</span>,” and “<span style="color:#808000;">A slanderer will not enter Paradise</span>,” <span style="color:#0000ff;">are understood to mean that such people will not enter Paradise by a perfect, absolute entrance without punishment</span>. Rather, punishment may precede that (his entrance to Paradise) if nothing wipes out that sin like Allah’s forgiveness or something else. So the meaning is he will not enter Paradise absolutely and perfectly without some sort of punishment preceding that; by this meaning all the evidences are understood together (with no contradiction).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#003300;">The Four Principles of &lt;&lt;You (Alone) We Worship&gt;&gt; </span><br />
<span style="color:#003300;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#003300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Four Principles</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; is built upon four principles which comprise conviction in what Allaah and His Messenger love and are pleased with from the statements of the tongue and the heart and from the actions of the heart and the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Uboodiyaah</em> (servitude to Allaah) is a comprehensive title for these four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the real people of &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;are the people of these four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the statement of the heart, it is the belief in what Allaah <em>–Subhanahu-</em>informed of about His Self, His Names and His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels and the meeting with Him; as was revealed upon the tongues of His Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the statement of the tongue, it is information of Allaah and His Names and Attributes….etc.  Calling to and defending that, clarifying the falsity of <em>Bida’</em> -which opposes Allaah – establishing His remembrance and conveying His commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions of the heart include having love for Him, reliance upon Him, turning repentantly to Him, fear of Him and hope in Him, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him, having patience upon His commands and prohibitions and upon what He has decreed, being pleased with that and with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, having obedience to Allaah and loyalty to Him, having submission for Him and humility and being subservient to him, having serenity with Him as well as other actions of the hearts whose obligation is greater than that of the actions of the limbs and whose recommended actions are more beloved to Allaah than the recommended actions of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions of the limbs without the actions of the hearts are either lacking in or are of little benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the actions of the limbs then they are like prayer and striving, moving one’s feet to <em>Jumu’ah</em> and the congregational prayer, helping the weak one and being good to the creation etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; is adhering to these four rulings and accepting them and &lt;&lt; and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt; Is requesting help upon these principles and having the capability to perform them. &lt;&lt;Guide us to the Straight Way&gt;&gt; consists of knowing these two matters (&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt;) in detail, the guidance to establish them and to have the methodology of the path of the righteous in seeking Allaah with these principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Da’wah</em> of the Prophets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers did indeed invite to &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all of them invited to the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and to having sincerity of worship for Him, from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh <em>–alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> said to his people: &lt;&lt; ‘Worship Allaah! You have no other <em>Ilâh</em>(God) but Him.’ &gt;&gt; [al-‘Araaf: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Hood, Salih, Shuaib <em>–alayhimus-salaam &#8211;</em> and Ibraheem <em>–alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> said.  Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allaah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) <em>Tâghût</em> (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût </em>besides Allaah).’ &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And We did not send any Messenger before you except that We inspired him (saying): <em>Lâ ilâha illa Ana </em>[none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).’ &gt;&gt; [Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O (you) Messengers! Eat of the <em>Taiyibât </em>[all kinds of <em>Halâl </em>foods], and do righteous deeds. Verily! I am Well-Acquainted with what you do. And verily! This, your religion (of Islaamic Monotheism) is one religion, and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. &gt;&gt; [Muminoon: 51-52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Characteristic of <em>Uboodiyaah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala made <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (servitude to Allaah) a characteristic of the most perfect of His creation and as such made them close to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Messiah will never be proud and reject to be a slave of Allaah, nor the Angels who are near (to Allaah). And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself. &gt;&gt; [Nisa’:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Surely, those who are with your Lord (Angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. &gt;&gt; [Ara’af: 206]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this explains there being a complete stop in the saying of Allaah in Soorah Anbiyaa &lt;&lt; To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. &gt;&gt; Stop here  then resume reading from &lt;&lt; And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship). They (i.e. the angels) glorify His Praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so). &gt;&gt; [Anbiyaa: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are two complete separate sentences, i.e. indeed to Allaah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth as a slave and Angel.  Then resumed with another sentence, He said: &lt;&lt; And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him &gt;&gt; i.e. that the Angels who are there are not too proud to worship Him such that they do not worship him haughtily with rejection, nor would they scorn or reject worshipping Him, nor are they (too) arrogant to worship, nor do they tire so that they become heedless of it, nor do they cease.  Rather, their worship of Allaah and their distancing Him from imperfection is the same as breathing is to the son of Adam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the first is the characteristic of the slaves of Allaah with regards to Allaah’s<em>Ruboobeeyah</em> (Lordship) and the second is the characteristic with regards to the slaves of Allaah’s <em>Ilaaheeyah</em> (Worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 63] to the end of the Soorah[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allaah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. &gt;&gt; [Insaan: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and remember Our slave Daawood,&gt;&gt; [Saad: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And remember Our slave Ayoob, &gt;&gt; [Saad: 41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And remember Our slaves, Ibrahim, Ishaaq, and Ya’qoob &gt;&gt; [Saad: 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said about Sulayman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)! &gt;&gt; [Saad: 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said about the Messiah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He [‘Iesa] was no more than a slave. We granted Our Favour to him &gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah made ‘Isa’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> goal to be <em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) and not <em>Ilaaheeyah</em> (being worshipped), unlike what his enemies, the Christians have done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah describes the noblest of His creation and the highest of them to Him with the status of <em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah), which is the noblest of ranks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad Peace be upon him)&gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad) &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has sent down to His slave (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur’aan)&gt;&gt; [Kahf: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah spoke about His slave with <em>Uboodeeyah</em> in regards to the revelation of the Book (Qur’aan) to him and likewise in regards to the challenge of bringing something similar to the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It has been revealed to me that) When the slave of Allaah (Muhammad) stood up supplicating to (his Lord Allaah) in prayer to Him they (the Jinns) made around him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet’s recitation). &gt;&gt; [Jinn: 19] So Allaah mentions him with Uboodeeyah in the matter of giving Dawa’ to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him] Who took His slave for a journey by night &gt;&gt; [Isra’: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentions him with <em>Uboodeeyah</em> in the matter of the night journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh on the authority of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said: ‘Do not over praise me like the Christians over praised the son of Maryam.  Indeed I am a slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth: ‘I am a slave. I eat what a slave eats and sit like a slave sits.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <em>Saheeh</em> of Bukhari on the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr who said: ‘I read the description of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the Torah: Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah, My slave, My messenger, I named him al-Muttawakil, he does not have evil manners nor is he hard-hearted.  He was not one to raise his voice to compete in market places, he will not respond to evil with an evil, but he will pardon and forgive.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – Subhanahu – gave absolute glad-tidings and signs for His worshippers, where He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So announce the good news to My slaves, those who listen to the Word [good advice <em>Lâ ilâha ill-Allâh</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) and Islaamic Monotheism, etc.] and follow the best thereof (i.e. worship Allaah Alone, repent to Him and avoid <em>Tâghût, </em>etc.) &gt;&gt; [Zumar: 17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah provided them with absolute security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It will be said to the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism): My worshippers! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve, (You) who believed in Our <em>Ayaat</em>and were Muslims (i.e. who submit totally to Allaah’s Will and believe in the Oneness of Allaah – Islaamic Monotheism).&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 68-69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytaan had his authority over Allaah’s slaves, specifically, cut short and he placed his authority over the one who aligned himself with him and associated partners with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the <em>Ghâwîn</em> (<em>Mushrikûn</em> and those who go astray, etc.).&gt;&gt; [Hijr: 42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan) and those who join partners with Him (Allaah) [i.e. those who are <em>Mushrikûn</em> &#8211; polytheists]. &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 99-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> made <em>Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) of<em>Uboodeeyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) the highest level of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Jibraeel – when Jibraeel asked the Messenger about <em>Ihsaan</em> – ‘Worship Allaah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then know that He sees you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ vol 1 p.120</p>
<hr size="1" />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &lt;&lt; And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness. And those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing. And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily! Its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.’ Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to dwell. And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). And those who invoke not any other <em>ilâh </em>(god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islaamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance. And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.And those who, when they are reminded of the <em>Ayât</em> of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat. And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the <em>Muttaqûn</em>“(pious) Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein; excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to dwell. Say: ‘My Lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to Him. But now you have indeed denied (Him). So the torment will be yours for ever (inseparable permanent punishment).’ &gt;&gt;[Furqan: 63-77]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proclamation of Tawheed is an Evidence of ‘Aqeedah</strong><strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the most significant of the great lessons which benefits the Muslim in his <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em> is the obligation to have sincerity in all worship for Allaah Alone Who has no partners. So when the Muslim begins his <em>Hajj</em>, the first thing that he begins with is the proclamation of <em>Tawheed</em> and rejection of <em>Shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah), when he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ , لَبَّيْكَ لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ , إنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ ، لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">labbaykallaahumma labbaika, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeats it and raises his voice with it whilst, at the same time, he is conscious of and feels what this proclamation indicates: the obligation to single out Allaah Alone with worship and keeping far away from <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Allaah is Alone in His favours and His giving, having no partners, then likewise He is Alone in His <em>Tawheed</em> not having any equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one is supplicated to except Allaah, none is relied upon except Allaah, none is sought for aid except Allaah nor is any type of the different aspects of worship directed to anyone except Allaah. Just as the slave is required to make his intention for the <em>Hajj</em>completely for Allaah Alone, then in the same way he is required to make his intention in all the worship he performs and in all the acts of obedience by which he becomes closer to Allaah, for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah then he has committed<em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, The Great, and he has suffered a clear loss, nullified his actions and Allaah will not accept his actions from him, neither his optional actions nor his obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam came with this great proclamation, the proclamation of the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah and distancing oneself from all types of<em>Shirk</em> large or small, minor or major.  Whereas the <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists), the worshippers of idols and statues, used to make the declaration to enter into their<em>Ihraam</em> for <em>Hajj</em> with <em>Shirk</em> and abuse, they would say in their <em>Talbeeyaah</em>(proclamation):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in the proclamation, they included their false gods along with Allaah and they place – what they claim for their false gods – in the Hands of Allaah and this is the meaning of the saying of Allaah about them in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَا يُؤۡمِنُ أَكۡثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشۡرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And most of them believe not in Allaah except that they attribute partners unto Him&gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that most of them do not believe in Allaah, that He is The Creator, The Provider and The Disposer except that they associate partners with Him in worship – with idols who do not possess anything and statues that do not benefit or bring harm, nor do they give anything or prevent harm, rather they do not possess anything at all for themselves, let alone possess anything for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu   – </em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is from their <em>Eemaan</em>, that if it is said to them: ‘Who created the sky?’ ‘Who created the earth?’ and ‘Who created the mountains?’ They would say ‘Allaah’ yet they are still<em>Mushrikoon</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ikrimaa that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say: Allaah. That is their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and yet they worship other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their <em>Eemaan</em> is their saying: Allaah is our Creator, He gives us provision and He takes our lives. So this is <em>Eemaan</em>, along with <em>Shirk</em> in their worship of other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Zayd who said: ‘There is no-one that worships someone along with Allaah except that he believes in Allaah, knows that Allaah is His lord and that Allaah is his Creator and his Provider, but along with this he commits <em>Shirk</em> with Him. Do you not see how Ibraheem said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَالَ أَفَرَءَيۡتُم مَّا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡبُدُونَ ٧٥ أَنتُمۡ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ ٱلۡأَقۡدَمُونَ ٧٦ فَإِنَّهُمۡ عَدُوّٞ لِّيٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ ٧٧</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; He said: ‘Do you observe that which you have been worshipping – you and your ancient fathers? Verily they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds. &gt;&gt; [ash-Shoora:75-77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraheem <em>– alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> knew that they worshipped the Lord of the worlds along with those whom they used to worship.’ Then he said: there is none that commits <em>Shirk</em>except that he believes in Allaah, do you not see how the Arabs used to proclaim and say: ‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the <em>Mushrikoon</em> used to say.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Mushrikoon</em> at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to affirm that their Creator, Provider and The Disposer of their affairs was Allaah, but even with this affirmation they did not make the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah. Rather, they worshipped others along with Him in their worshipping of trees, stones and idols, besides other things. Allaah made this matter clear and explained it in many places in the Noble Qur’aan, such as His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَئِن سَأَلۡتَهُم مَّنۡ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُۖ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤۡفَكُونَ ٦١</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And if you were to ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?’ They will surely reply ‘Allaah’. How then are they deviating (as disbelievers)? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Ankabut: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat</em> with this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Katheer <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book of <em>Tafseer</em>: ‘Allaah Ta’ala speaks, affirming that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him- because the<em>Mushrikeen</em> who worship Him, worship others along with Him- they acknowledge that He is Independent in His creation of the heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the change of the night and day and that He is The Creator and The Provider for His slaves, The One Who determines their different times of death, their different types of provision and the contrast between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, from amongst them, are the rich and the poor and He knows best that which is befitting for everyone amongst them, he who deserves to be rich and he who deserves to be poor. It is mentioned that He is Independent in creating things and He is Alone in organising the creation.  So, if this is the case, then why is someone other than Him relied upon? Since He is Alone in possessing everything then He should be the only One worshipped. Many times Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> establishes His status as being worthy of being worshipped due to the recognition of the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship. The<em>Mushrikoon</em> used to acknowledge this as they used to say in their proclamation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, except for the partner who is Yours, whom You possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why is someone else relied upon?[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many places in the noble Qur’aan which mention this meaning of establishing proof against the <em>Kuffar</em> of their obligation to have <em>Tawheed</em> of Him in His worship and making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him due to their acknowledgement of the Lordship of Allaah <em>–Jala wa Oola</em>. Due to this, Allaah addresses them regarding the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship with a rhetorical question. So, if they affirm His Lordship, He uses this as an evidence against them, that He is The One Who deserves to be worshipped Alone and He rebukes them, rejecting their association of others with Him, even though they acknowledge that He Alone is The Lord; because whoever acknowledges that He Alone is The Lord then it necessitates that all worship is performed sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it becomes clear that acknowledging that Allaah is The Creator, The Provider, The Benefactor, The One who controls and The Disposer of the affairs of the creation, (then this) is not sufficient for the (establishment of the) <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and it does not save anyone from the punishment of Allaah on the Day of Judgement, unless all worship is sincerely for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not accept the <em>Tawheed</em> of Lordship from His slaves unless they single Him out Alone in the <em>Tawheed</em> of <em>Ibaadah</em> (worship), such that they do not take an equal with Him, nor do they supplicate to anyone along with Him, nor do they rely upon anyone except Him, nor do they direct any form of worship to other than Him <em>-Subhanahu</em>, so just as He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> is The Only One to create then He is worshipped Alone with all types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah Ta’ala said to those who turned their worship to other than Him, even though they knew that He is their Creator and Provider:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادٗا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ ٢٢</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadiAllaah anhu –</em> said: ‘i.e. Do not associate others with Allaah assigning equals to Him, who do not bring any benefit, nor do they harm while you know that you have no Lord who provides for you other than Him. Indeed you have come to know that what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>called you to, of Allaah’s <em>Tawheed</em>, then that is the truth wherein there is no doubt.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: ‘You know that Allaah created you and He created the Heavens and the earth, then you ascribe equals unto Him.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the blessing upon the <em>Ummah</em> of Islaam is great; their being guided to the<em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah in His Lordship, worship and His Names and Attributes. The blessing of Allaah upon the Muslims is great in their being capable of proclaiming Allaah’s<em>Tawheed</em>, since others besides them proclaim <em>Shirk</em> and set up equals with Him.  So, for Allaah belongs the praise, <em>-Subhanahu-</em> for giving the ability, His blessings and guidance and to Him belong many good and blessed praises, such as our Noble Lord loves and is pleased with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah bin Humayd<br />
SOURCE: His treatise At-Tawheed (pg. 15-20)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the upcoming E-Book <b>&#8220;An Explanation of Tawheed&#8221;</b> of Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah bin Humayd,<i>rahimahullaah</i>, [Died 1402H]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to the One who created (His) servants for the purpose of worshipping Him, and who commanded them to single Him out in worship and obedience. And I bear witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, and with no partner, whether in His Lordship (Ruboobiyyah) or the Servitude to Him (Uloohiyyah). And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger, may Allaah send His peace and blessings on him, his family, his Companions, and whoever follows his path and adheres to his Call, until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before you is a small pamphlet, which explains the pure Salafee Creed, free from everything that has wrongly mixed into it from false concepts and innovations. It is the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah according to the Salaf (predecessors) of this ummah, who consist of the Companions (Sahaabah), their Followers (Taabi’een) and those who came after them from the true scholars about whom the Muslims have unanimously agreed on as to their guidance and understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Tawheed (Oneness of Allaah) that has been indicated in the Qur’aan, and the Sunnah, and which the Salaf of this ummah have unanimously agreed on, can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Allaah&#8217;s Oneness in Lordship)<br />
2. Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Allaah&#8217;s Oneness in Worship)<br />
3. Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat (Allaah&#8217;s Oneness in His Names and Attributes)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>An Explanation of Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Oneness in Lordship)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s Oneness in Lordship, then the (Arab) polytheists whom the Prophet was sent to affirmed and acknowledged it, but it was not enough to enter them into Islaam. So they affirmed that Allaah was the only true Creator, Provider, Giver of Life and Death, and Administrator of all affairs in this world, which requires His Wisdom and Desire. However, this kind of affirmation is not enough to make a person become a Muslim. Allaah says: <b>“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or ‘Who owns the hearing and the sight?’ And ‘Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living?’ And ‘Who disposes of the affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allaah.’ Then say: ‘Will you not then be dutiful to Him?’”</b> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: “Will you not then single Him out in worship, whilst abandoning the worship of others besides Him?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah’s statement: <b>“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth’”</b> means: “Who is the One who sends down rain water from the sky, thus causing the earth to open through His Ability and Will, and bear therewith grain, grapes, clover plants, olives, date palms, gardens packed with many trees, and fruits and herbage? Is it a god along with Allaah?” They will say: “It is Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement: <b>“Or ‘Who owns the hearing and the sight?’”</b> means: “The One who granted you this power of hearing and ability to see?” And if He wanted to, He would take that away and deprive them of it, as occurs in Allaah’s statement: <b>“Say: It is He who created you and endowed you with hearing and seeing and hearts. Little thanks do you give.”</b> [Surah Al-Mulk: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“Say (to the disbelievers): ‘Tell me if Allaah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed up your hearts, who is there – a god other than Allaah – that can restore them for you?”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And ‘Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living”</b> through His great Ability and all-encompassing Grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And ‘Who disposes of the affairs”</b> means: “Who is the One in whose Hand lies the sovereignty over everything. And He protects all, while against Him there is no protector?” And He is the Administrator over all affairs, the Ruler of whom there is no end to His Rule. He is not to be questioned as to what He does, while they (i.e. the creation) will be questioned. <b>“Everyone in the heavens and the earth asks (i.e. supplicates to) Him. Everyday He is engaged in some affair.”</b> [Surah Ar-Rahmaan: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the dominion, whether in the heavens or in the earth or what lies between them, from angels, mankind and jinn, are all in need of Him, subservient to Him and humble themselves before Him.<b>“They will say: ‘Allaah.’”</b> This means they know and acknowledge that it is Allaah. <b>“Then say: ‘Will you not then be dutiful to Him?’”</b> meaning: “Will you not be afraid from Him that you are worshipping others besides Him based on your opinions and ignorance?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the times that Allaah presents an argument against the polytheists, He uses against them the fact that they acknowledge and affirm His Oneness in Lordship (Ruboobiyyah) over the fact that (in spite of this) they reject His Oneness in Worship (Uloohiyyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many ayaat that bear this same meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“Say: To whom belongs the earth and whoever lies therein, if you truly know? They will say: It belongs to Allaah. Say: Will you not then remember? Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne? They will say: Allaah. Say: Will you not then fear Allaah? Say: Who is the One in whose Hand lies the sovereignty over everything. And He protects all, while against Him there is no protector, if you truly know? They will say: All that belongs to Allaah. Say: How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth?”</b> [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 84-89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hearts of human beings were innately designed and fashioned to accept and acknowledge Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah. So no one rejects it except for a few rare individuals from mankind Look at Pharaoh and how he said: <b>“I am your lord, the most High.”</b> [Surah An-Naazi’aat: 24] And: <b>“I know not that you (his chiefs) have a god other than me.”</b> [Surah Al-Qasas: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But yet at the same time, he acknowledged the existence of the Creator and Originator of creation, as Allaah narrates the story about him in His saying: <b>“And they (Pharaoh and his people) rejected them (signs given to Moosaa) wrongfully and arrogantly, even though their own selves were convinced by them.”</b> [Surah An-Naml: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah narrates what his Prophet Moosaa said to Pharaoh: <b>“You indeed know that these signs have been sent down by none other than the Lord of the heavens and the earth.”</b>[Surah Al-Israa: 102]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Conditions of <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ </em>‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By Hafidh al-Hakami <em>-Rahim</em><em>ah</em><em>ullaah-<br />
</em>Taken from his book ‘Ma’arij al-Qabool’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first Condition: <em>al-Ilm</em> – Knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> and its intent are affirmation and negation, so knowledge negates ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So know that <em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped in truth except Allaah) &gt;&gt; [Muhammad: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; except those who bear witness to the truth &gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means that they testify to <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> &lt;&lt; while they know&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 86] with their hearts and they pronounce its meaning with their tongues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allaah bears witness that <em>La ilaha ‘illa</em><em> Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. <em>La ilaha ‘illa</em><em> Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&gt;&gt; [Aali-‘Imran: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who do not know?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allaah’s Signs and Verses)&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah&gt;&gt; [Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And these similitudes We put forward for mankind, but none will understand them except those who have knowledge (of Allaah and His Signs, etc.)&gt;&gt; [Ankaboot: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim on the authority of ‘Uthmaan <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘Whoever dies knowing <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> entersParadise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Condition: <em>Al-Yaqeen</em> – Certainty</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second condition is certainty which negates doubt, such that the one who pronounces <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> does it with certainty of what these words indicate, with a decisive certainty. This is since<em>Eemaan</em> cannot do without certain knowledge (<em>Ilm al-Yaqeen</em>), as opposed to suspicious knowledge (<em>Ilm al-Thann</em>), and what would be the case if doubt entered <em>Eemaan</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Only those are the believers who have believed in Allaah and His Messenger and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allaah. Those! They are the truthful. &gt;&gt;[Hujuraat: 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So certainty was a condition for them having truthfulness in their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and His Messenger and also that they did not have uncertainty or doubt <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for uncertainty then that comes from the <em>Munafiqeen</em> (hypocrites) – and we seek refuge with Allaah. They were the ones about whom Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who believe not in Allaah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your leave (to be exempted from<em>Jihaad</em>). So in their doubts they waver &gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira –<em>RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘I testify that none is worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah. There is no servant of Allaah who meets Allaah with these two testifications, not doubting in them, except that he enters Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘there is no servant of Allaah who meets Allaah with these two testifications, not doubting in them, who is prevented from entering Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the Saheeh of Muslim on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> from the long hadeeth that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; sent him with his shoes and said: ‘Whoever you meet behind this garden that testifies <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> with certainty in his heart then give him the glad tidings of Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger made the entrance into Paradise of the one who says <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> conditional upon his having certainty of it in his heart, with no doubt in it. So, if the condition is removed then the reward is also then removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Condition: <em>al-Qabool</em> – Acceptance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acceptance of what this statement necessitates is with the heart and the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – narrates to us the news of what precededregarding those who were previously saved and regarding the punishment of those who rejected and refused to accept this statement. As Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: ‘We found our fathers following a certain way and religion and we will indeed follow their footsteps.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The warner) said: ‘Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?’ They said: ‘Verily, We disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So We took revenge of them, then see what was the end of those who denied (Islaamic Monotheism)&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf 23-25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then (in the end) We save Our Messengers and those who believe! Thus it is incumbent upon Us to save the believers. &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And indeed We did send Messengers before you to their own peoples. They came to them with clear proofs, then We took vengeance on those who committed crimes (disbelief, setting partners in worship with Allaah, sins, etc.), and (as for) the believers it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). &gt;&gt; [Room 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – informed us of what He promised to those who accept <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> of reward and what He has prepared of punishment for the one who rejects <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It will be said to the Angels): ‘Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils) and what they used to worship instead of Allaah. And lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘But stop them, verily they are to be questioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nay, but that Day they shall surrender,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they will turn to one another and question one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: ‘It was you who used to come to us from the right side [i.e. from the right side of one of us and beautify for us every evil, order polytheism for us, and prevent us from the truth i.e. Islaamic Monotheism and from every good deed].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will reply: ‘Nay, you yourselves were not believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>And we had no authority over you. Nay! But you were transgressing people (disobedient, polytheists, and disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>So now the Word of our Lord has been justified against us, that we shall certainly (have to) taste (the torment).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then verily, that Day, they will (all) share in the torment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, that is how We deal with <em>Al­-Mujrimoon </em>(polytheists, sinners, criminals, the disobedient to Allaah, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, when it was said to them: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah), they puffed themselves up with pride (i.e. denied it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (they) said: ‘Are we going to abandon our (gods) for the sake of a mad poet? &gt;&gt; [Saaffat: 22-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- made the cause of and the reason for their punishment their arrogance towards <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> and their belying of those who came with it. So, they did not negate what Allaah negated and they did not affirm what Allaah affirmed, rather they said rejecting and proudly:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘Has he made the <em>âliha </em>(gods) (all) into One <em>Ilâh </em>(God – Allaah). Verily, this is a curious thing!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the leaders among them went about (saying): ‘Go on, and remain constant to your <em>âliha</em> (gods)! Verily, this is a thing designed (against you)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We have not heard (the like) of this among the people of these later days. This is nothing but an invention! &gt;&gt; [Saad: 5-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here they said : &lt;&lt;‘Are we going to abandon our (gods) for the sake of a mad poet? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah -Azza wa Jal – refuted them and turned that back on them via His Messenger &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Nay! He has come with the truth (i.e. Allaah’s Religion – Islaamic Monotheism and this Qur’aan) and he confirms the Messengers (before him who brought Allaah’s religion – Islaamic Monotheism).&gt;&gt; [Saaffat: 37] to the end of the Aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said about those before them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Except the chosen slaves of Allaah (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islaamic Monotheism). For them there will be a known provision (in Paradise). Fruits; and they shall be honoured, in the Gardens of delight (Paradise) &gt;&gt; [Saaffat: 40-43] to the end of the<em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Whoever brings a good deed (i.e. Belief in the Oneness of Allaah along with every deed of righteousness), will have better than its worth, and they will be safe from the terror on that Day. &gt;&gt;[Naml: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Saheeh on the authority of Abu Musa <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> thatthe Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘The like of what Allaah sent me with of guidance and knowledge is like heavy rainfall which poured onto the ground. There was some land which was fertile which absorbed the water and many plants and grass began to grow. There was some land which was arid but it held the water and Allaah made the people benefit by it, so they drank from it, used the water and used it for agriculture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was some other land which was affected by the water but was flat land where nothing would grow. It did not hold the water nor did it allow plants to grow. That is the example of the one who has understanding of the Deen and benefits from what Allaah sent me with, so he learns it and teaches it and the example of he whocannot raise his head due to it and does not accept the guidance of Allaah with which I have been sent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth Condition</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Inqiyaad</em></strong><strong> – Submission &amp; Obedience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Submission and obedience to what <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> requires and that it negates disobedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islaamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islaam) &gt;&gt; [Zumar: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah and he is a <em>Muhsin </em>(a good-doer). &gt;&gt; [Nisaa’: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And whosoever submits his face (himself) to Allaah, while he is a<em>Muhsin</em> (good­-doer), then he has grasped the most trustworthy hand­hold [<em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)]. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means holding onto <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And to Allaah return all matters for decision. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is, that he submits his face to Allaah i.e. he obeys Him, and he is a righteous person worshipping Allaah Alone.Whoever does not submit his face to Allaah and is not a righteous person then he has not held onto the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the meaning of the saying of Allaah -Azza wa Jal which follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And whoever disbelieved, let not his disbelief grieve you, to Us is their return and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allaah is the All­-Knower of what is in the hearts (of men).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 23-24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth Condition</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Sidq</em></strong><strong> – Truthfulness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthfulness to <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> negates lying, falsehood and it is to say <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> truthfully from one’s heart and to make one’s speech in accordance to what is in one’s heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>Alif ­Lâm­ Mîm.</em> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe’ and will not be tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allaah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allaah knows all of that before testing them). &gt;&gt; [Ankaboot: 1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said regarding the <em>Munafiqeen</em> (hypocrites) who said‘<em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, speaking falsely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘We believe in Allaah and the Last Day’ while in fact they believe not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (think to) deceive Allaah and those who believe while they only deceive themselves and perceive (it) not!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and Allaah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 8-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many times has Allaah -Ta’ala- mentioned them and exposed them, repeatedly exposing their cover and revealing it. He makes their humiliation manifest in more than one place in His Book such as in Soorahs Baqarah, Aali-‘Imran, Nisaa’, Anfaal, Tawbah as well as a whole Soorah dedicated to them (i.e. <em>Al-Munaafiqoon</em>) along withother Soorahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Mu’aadh bin Jabal <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> -:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none who testifies that <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’ truthfully from his heart except that Allaah prohibits him from entering the Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah made being saved from the Fire, for the one who says this statement, conditional by saying it truthfully from his heart. Merely pronouncing <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> does not benefit the one who says it unless there is agreement with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Anas bin Malik and Talha bin Ubaydullaah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumaa</em>&#8211; in the story of the Bedouin – who was Damaam bin Tha’alabah, a delegate of Bani Sa’ad bin Bakr – when he asked the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; about the rulings of Islaam and was then informed by him.He then asked the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – ‘Do I have to do anything else?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; answered: ‘No, except if you perform it optionally.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin said: ‘I swear by Allaah I will not increase uponthat nor decrease from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘He will be successful if he is truthful.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some narrations: ‘Indeed if he is truthful then he will enter into Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger made it a condition for his success and entrance into Paradise that he was truthful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth Condition:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Ikhlaas</em></strong><strong> – Sincerity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity is purifying actions from all the stains of <em>Shirk</em> with righteous intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Surely, the religion (i.e. worship and obedience) is for Allaah only&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And they were commanded not but that they should worship Allaah and worship none but Him Alone &gt;&gt; [al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So worship Allaah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only, (not to show-off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship)&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘Verily, I am commanded to worship Allaah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only &gt;&gt; [Zumar :11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say ‘Allaah Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only, not to show off and not setting up rivals with Him in worship.’&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them. Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold fast to Allaah, purify their religion for Allaah (by worshipping none but Allaah and do good for Allaah’s sake only, not to show-off), then they will be with the believers. &gt;&gt; [Nisaa: 145-146]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other similar <em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Bukhari on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> : ‘Of those people happiest with my intercession is the one who said ‘<em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> sincerely from his heart or from his self.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in the Saheeh of Bukhari on the authority of ‘Utbaan bin Malik<em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; who said: ‘Indeed Allaah prohibited the Fire for the one who said: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> desiring by it the Face of Allaah – <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Jaami’ of Tirmidhee on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘A slave of Allaah does not ever say <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> sincerely except that the doors to the heavens are opened for him until it reaches the <em>‘Arsh</em>, as long as he keeps away from the major sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhee said the hadeeth via this chain is Hasan Ghareeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh Condition:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Muhabbah</em></strong><strong> – Love</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which is having love for this statement, what it necessitates and indicates, loving its people – those who act upon it, adhering to its conditions – and to hate what violates it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allaah as rivals (to Allaah). They love them as they love Allaah. But those who believe love Allaah more (than anything else). &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islaam), Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the Way of Allaah and never afraid of the blame of th0e blamers.  &gt;&gt; [Maa’idah: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – informed us that His worshippers, the believers, are more severe in their love for Him. That is because they do not associate anyone else with Him in their love for Him, unlike those from the <em>Mushrikeen </em>who claimed they loved Him but then also took partners with Allaah whom they loved just as they loved Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sign that the slave of Allaah loves his Lord is that he submits to what Allaah loves, even if it opposes his desires and that he also hates what his Lord hates, even if his desires are inclined to it. The slave of Allaah is loyal to whomever Allaah and His Messenger are loyal to and he has enmity towards whomever has enmity towardsAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He follows His Messenger, <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; imitates his example and accepts his guidance. All of these are signs of the presence ofthe conditions of love. It is not conceivable to have love without its conditions being present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Have you seen him who has taken as his <em>ilâh </em>(god) his own desire? Would you then be a <em>Wakeel</em> (a disposer of his affairs or a watcher) over him? &gt;&gt; [Furqaan: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires) as his<em>ilâh</em> (god), and Allaah knowing (him as such) left him astray and sealed his hearing and his heart and put a cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allaah?&gt;&gt; [Jaathiyah: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone who worships other than Allaah along with Him, then in reality he worships his own desire. Every sin by which Allaah is disobeyed, it is due to the slave of Allaah submitting to his desires rather than to the commands of Allaah – Azza wa Jal – and the avoidance of His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said regarding loyalty and enmity for the sake of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraheem and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you and there has begun between us and you hostility and hatred forever, until you believe in Allaah Alone’&gt;&gt; [Mumtahana: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; You will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day befriending those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even though they were their fathers, their sons, their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts &gt;&gt;[Mujadilah:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as<em>Auliyâ’ </em>(friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but <em>Auliyâ’ </em>to one another.  And if any amongst you takes them as <em>Auliyâ’, </em>then surely he is one of them &gt;&gt; [Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Take not for <em>Auliyâ’ </em>(supporters and helpers) your fathers and your brothers if they prefer disbelief to Belief. And whoever of you does so, then he is one of the <em>Zâlimûn </em>(wrong-doers, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline and the dwellings in which you delight … are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger and striving hard and fighting in His Cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are the rebellious, disobedient to Allaah. &gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 23-24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as friends &gt;&gt; [Mumtahana: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the Soorah. And there are other Aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Following the Messenger </strong><strong><em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said regarding the conditions for following His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’ Say: ‘Obey Allaah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. &gt;&gt; [Aali-‘Imran: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of Eemaan: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Anas <em>–Ra</em><em>dhi’</em><em>allaahu anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Bukhari and Muslim narrate on the authority of Anas and of Abu Huraira <em>–Radhi’Allaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said that: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is what the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – brought, information about Allaah, the commands relating to what Allaah loves and is pleased with and prohibitions of what Allaah dislikes and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the slave of Allaah follows what Allaah commands and keeps away from what Allaah prohibits, even if that opposes his desire, then he is a true believer. So what is the case if he desires nothingother than this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a hadeeth: ‘The strongest part of <em>al-Eemaan</em> is loving and hating for the sake of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> said: ‘Whoever loves for the sake of Allaah, hates for the sake of Allaah, is loyal for the sake of Allaah and has enmity for the sake of Allaah then he obtains the alliance of Allaah due to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has become common amongst the people today is a brotherhood based upon the affairs of the <em>Dunya</em>, which does not benefit its people in anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan al-Basri and other than him from the Salaf mention that: ‘There were a people who claimed the love of Allaah -Azza wa Jal – so Allaah tried them with this <em>Aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>), Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’ Say (O Muhammad): ‘Obey Allaah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. &gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 31-32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari <em>-Rahim</em><em>ah</em><em>ullaah-</em> said: Muhammad bin Sinaan narrated to us that Faleeh said that Hilaal bin ‘Alee narrated to us on the authority of ‘Atta bin Yassar on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘Everyone from my Ummah will enter Paradise, except the one who refuses to enter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, who would refuse?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Whoever obeys me enters Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused to enter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari said Muhammad bin Ubadah informed us that Yazeed narrated to us that Saleem – and he praised him – narrated to us that Sa’eed bin Meena narrated to us – or I heard – Jaabir bin Abdullaah say: ‘Some angels came to the Prophet while he was sleeping. Some of them said: ‘He is sleeping.’ Others said: ‘His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said: ‘There is an example for this companion of yours.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: ‘Then set forth an example for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them said: ‘He is sleeping.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The others said: ‘His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said: ‘His example is of a man who built a house then offered a banquet therein and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house nor did he eat of the banquet.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Angels said: ‘Interpret this example to him so that he may understand it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them said: ‘He is sleeping.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The others said; ‘His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said: ‘The house stands for Paradise and the caller is Muhammad; whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad distinguished between the people (i.e. through his message the good is distinguished from the bad and the believers from the disbelievers).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it should be known that the testification <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> is not complete except with the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should also be known that loving Allaah –Azza wa Jal – cannot be complete except by loving what He loves and disliking what He dislikes. There is no way to knowing what Allaah – Ta’ala- loves and is pleased with or what He dislikes and rejects except by following what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; ordered and keeping away from what he prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So loving Allaah necessitates loving the Messenger of Allaah, believing in him and following him. This is why loving Allaah is connected to loving the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; in many places in the Qur’aan, such as the saying of Allaah -Azza wa Jal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline and the dwellings in which you delight … are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger and striving hard and fighting in His Cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are <em>Al-Fâsiqûn </em>(the rebellious, disobedient to Allaah). &gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other <em>Aayaat</em> like this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who  follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Hafidh al-Hakami <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Taken from his book ‘Ma’arij al-Qabool’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words in the testification <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> are words which are the path to the success of entry into Paradise and salvation from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> said: &lt;&lt; And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. &gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan:  185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the way and path to happiness in the two worlds which cannot be reached except by these words.  It is with this statement that Allaah sent His Messengers and with it, He revealed His Books. The <em>Dunya</em> and the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell-Fire were created for this statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Happiness and wretchedness are directly related to this testification. Due to it, the records of deeds will be taken either to the right or the left and the scale will be either heavy or light.  By it is being saved from the Fire after its advent whilst not adhering to <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> is remaining in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to it, Allaah took the covenant, because of it is recompense and accountability and regarding it, will be the questioning on the Day of Meeting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> says: &lt;&lt; So, by your Lord, We shall certainly call all of them to account. For all that they used to do. &gt;&gt; [Al-Hijr: 92-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> said : &lt;&lt; Then surely, We shall question those (people) to whom it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers. &gt;&gt; [A’raaf: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> questioning those to whom <em>‘La</em><em> ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> was sent, on the Day of Judgement, then from that is Hissaying- &lt;&lt; And (remember) the Day (Allaah) will call to them and say: ‘What answer gave you to the Messengers?’&gt;&gt; [Qasas: 65] along with the preceding, following and other <em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah questioning the Messengers then from that is the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> &lt;&lt; On the Day when Allaah will gather the Messengers together and say to them: ‘What was the response you received (from men to your teaching)? They will say: ‘We have no knowledge, verily, only You are the All-­Knower of all that is hidden (or unseen, etc.).’&gt;&gt; [al-Mai’dah:109] and there are other similar<em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the greatest of blessings from Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal–</em> that Heblessed His slaves and guided them to <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’.</em>  This is why Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> mentioned it in Soorah an-Nahl, the Soorah of blessings, so He proceeded with it before every other blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &lt;&lt;He sends down the angels with inspiration of His Command to whom of His slaves He pleases (saying): Warn mankind that <em>Lâ ilâha illa Ana </em>(none has the right to be worshipped but I), so fear Me (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds). &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement of testification and the key to the land of happiness.  It is the foundation of the <em>Deen</em> and its foundingprinciple, the head of the affair, the trunk of its tree and the pillar of its canopy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rest of the pillars and obligations of the <em>Deen</em> extend and branchout from this testification.  Its completion is restricted to adhering to its meaning and performing what it requires.  It is the strong handhold that will never break regarding which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em>said: &lt;&lt; Whoever disbelieves in <em>Tâghût </em>(false gods) and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa’eed bin Jubayr and Dhihaak said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is the contract which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> mentioned when he said: &lt;&lt;None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from the Most Beneficent (Allaah). &gt;&gt; [Maryam: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>radiAllaah </em><em>anhuma-</em> said: ‘It is the testification of <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, renouncing any capability or strength for other than Allaah and not hoping except in Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> is <em>al-Husna</em> (the best – i.e. its meaning as stated byAllaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> when He said: &lt;&lt;As for him who gives (in charity), keeps his duty to Allaah and fears Him, And believes in <em>Al-Husna.</em> We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). &gt;&gt; [Layl: 5-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also mentioned by Abu AbdurRahman as-Sulamee, Dhihaak and was narrated by ‘Ateeyah on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement of truth which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> mentionedwhen He <em>–Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt; except those who bear witness to the truth (i.e. believed in the Oneness of Allaah, and obeyed His Orders), and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allaah). &gt;&gt;[Zukhruf :86]  as stated by al-Baghawi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement of <em>Taqwaa</em> (piety) as Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em>mentioned when He said: &lt;&lt; and made them stick to the word of piety (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. &gt;&gt; [Fath: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned by Ibn Jareer and Abdullaah bin Ahmad, byTirmidhi with <em>‘asaaneed</em> (chains) up to Ubayy bin Ka’ab <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em>on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement which is firmly-fixed as Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em>mentions when He says: &lt;&lt;Allaah will keep firm those who believe with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allaah Alone and none else) and in the Hereafter. &gt;&gt;[Ibraheem: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of al-Bara bin ‘Aazib <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the good statement (<em>kalimah Tayyibah</em>) which was previously made a solid example as Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> says: &lt;&lt;Do you not see how Allaah sets forth a parable? – A goodly word as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e. very high). &gt;&gt; [Ibraheem: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was mentioned by ‘Alee bin Talha on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation of this statement <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> is firmly fixed in a believer’s heart, its branches are righteous actions which ascend to the sky &#8211; to Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was mentioned by Dhihaak, Sa’eed bin Jubair, Ikrima’, Mujahid and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the goodness which Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal–</em> mentions when He says: &lt;&lt;Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof &gt;&gt; [An’aam: 160]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Ta’ala–</em> said: &lt;&lt;Whoever brings a good deed (i.e. Belief in the Oneness of Allaah along with every deed of righteousness), will have better than its worth and they will be safe from the terror on that Day. &gt;&gt; [Naml: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned by Zain al-Abideen and Ibraheem an-Nakha’aee and it is ascribed to the Messenger on the authority of Abee Dharr <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: ‘It is the best of righteous deeds.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> wipes out sins and mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the highest description which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> mentions when He says: &lt;&lt; His is the highest description (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but He and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth.&gt;&gt; [Room: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As was mentioned by Qatadah and Muhammad bin Jareer, also by Malik on the authority of Muhammad bin al-Munkadir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the means for success as is mentioned in Saheeh Muslim thatwhen the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> heard the <em>Mu’adhin</em> (the caller to the prayer) saying: <em>‘Ashhadu all</em><em>a ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> (I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’) he <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘You have exited the fire.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ubadah bin Saamitt <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying: ‘Whoever testifies that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah then Allaah prohibits the Fire for him.’ [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the hadeeth of intercession: ‘Take out from the Fire whoever said<em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> and had in his heart the like of an atom’s worth of <em>Eemaan</em>.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> is the means of entering into Paradise as is mentioned in Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Ubadah bin Saamitt <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever says <em>‘Ashhadu all</em><em>a ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareeka lahu wa anna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu</em> (I testify thatthere is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’) and that Isa is the slave of Allaah and the son of Allaah’s female slave, he was created by a word which was sent to Maryam and he is a command from Him, that Paradise is true and the Fire is true’, then Allaah will enter him into Paradise from whichever of the eight doors of Paradise he chooses.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘Allaah enters him into Paradise with what he has of actions.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the best thing with which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> is rememberedand the heaviest thing on the slave of Allaah’s scale on the Day of Judgement as mentioned in ‘Musnad’ on the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘When death was approaching the Prophet of Allaah, Nooh &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> he said to his son: I will narrate to you my bequest; I command you with two things and prohibit you from two things.  I command you with <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> (‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah)<strong><em>,</em></strong> if the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed upon one scale and <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>was placed on the other, then <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>  would be heavier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the seven heavens and the seven earths were a closed circle then<em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> would be able to break it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second thing I command you with is <em>Subhana Allaahi wa bihamdihi</em> (Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him), since it is a supplication for everything and by it, the creation is given its provision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I prohibit you from <em>Shirk</em> and pride. (The narrator said: I asked or someone asked) : O Messenger of Allaah as for <em>Shirk</em> then we know about it, but what is pride?  Is it that one of us has sandals with two good straps?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger answered: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked again: Is it that one of us has companions and they sit with him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger again answered: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone asked: O Messenger of Allaah, what is pride?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Ridiculing the truth and belittling and reviling the people.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in ‘Musnad’ on the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em>from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘Musa <em>–alayhi Sallam-</em> said: ‘O Lord teach me something by which I can remember You and supplicate to You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: O Musa say <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Musa said: O Lord everyone of Your slaves says this.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: O Musa say <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ </em>but I want something specific for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: O Musa if the seven heavens and the seven earths and what is in them other than Me were placed on a scale and <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> was placed on the scale then <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> wouldoutweigh them.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Tirmidhi, Nisa’ee and in Musnad on the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr bin al-Aas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah will single out a man from my <em>Ummah</em> in front of all the people on the Day of Judgement.  Ninety-nine scrolls will be unrolled for him; every scroll will stretch as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: Do you deny anything of this?  Did the Angelsrecording your deeds oppress you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the man will say: No, my Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will say: Do you have an excuse?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man will say: No, my Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will say: Yes, indeed, We have a good deed for you and indeed, there will be no oppression upon you today.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a card will be brought forth and in it will be: ‘I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: Bring your bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man will say: What is this card compared with these scrolls?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will say: Indeed, you will not be oppressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet continued: The scrolls will be put on one side of the scales and the card will be put on the other side, the scrolls will be light and the card will be heavy, there can be nothing more heavythan the name of Allaah.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj is an act of worship that must be devoted only to Allaah. It is a declaration and a manifestation of the belief in the Oneness (tawheed) of Allaah. It is a time to call upon Allaah to purify the self from any worship to other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim who declares the talbiyah: (Labbaika allaahumma labbaik. labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik; innal-hamda wan-ni&#8217;mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak) understands that it is a du’aa that means: “Here I am O Allaah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Surely all praise is due to You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours, and You have no partner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim, therefore, should submit himself completely (mentally, spiritually, and physically) to Allaah Alone. No worship should be devoted to statues, tombs, religious leaders, righteous men (dead or alive) or any part of the creation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tawheed of Allaah requires the Muslim to follow the perfect way of worship. This is the way (sunnah) of Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam as understood by the sahaabah (the companions of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), who were the best of mankind.</p>

Chapter 304<br />
Forbiddance of Believing in Ill Omens</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1674.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Not the transmission of disease of one person to another and no evil omen, but I am pleased with good omens</span>.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What is good omen?</span>&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A good word.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1675.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There is no infection and no evil omen; but if there is anything (that may be a source of trouble) then it could be a house, a horse, and a woman</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1676.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet never took ill omens.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1677.</b> `Urwah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: When talking of omens was mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best type of omen is the good omen</span>.&#8221; He added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A Muslim should not refrain from anything because of an omen.</span>&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told them, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any of you sees anything which he dislikes, he should say: `Allahuma la ya&#8217;ti bil-hasanati illa Anta, wa la yadfa`us-sayyi&#8217;ati illa Anta, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Bika (O Allah ! You Alone bring good things; You Alone avert evil things, and there is no might or power but in You)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen, he said to him,  &#8220;You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing  to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah. If they learn that, tell them that  Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if  they pray, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is  to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that,  then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Mu&#8217;adh! Do you know what Allah&#8217;s  Right upon His slaves is?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;To worship Him (Allah) Alone and to join none in worship with Him  (Allah). Do you know what their right upon Him is?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know best.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Not to punish them (if they do so).&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): &#8216;Say (O  Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One.&#8221; (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it  was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that  the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Quran.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man  who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the  Sura 112): &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One.&#8221; &#8216; (112.1) When they  returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them),  &#8220;Ask him why he does so.&#8221; They asked him and he said, &#8220;I do so because it  mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).&#8221; The  Prophet; said (to them), &#8220;Tell him that Allah loves him&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet said (to the messenger), &#8220;Go back and tell her that whatever Allah  takes is His, and whatever He gives is His, and everything with Him has a limited fixed  term (in this world). So order her to be patient and hope for Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; But  she sent the messenger to the Prophet again, swearing that he should come to her. So the  Prophets got up, and so did Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada and Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal (and went to her). When  the child was brought to the Prophet his breath was disturbed in his chest as if it were  in a water skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet . became flooded with tears, whereupon  Sa&#8217;d said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is this?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;This is mercy which Allah has put in the heart of His slaves, and Allah bestows His  mercy only on those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 373,  Vol. 2) </font></p>

Please intercede for us  with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;I am not  fit for this undertaking&#8217; and mention to them the mistakes he had committed, and add,  &#8220;But you d better go to Noah as he was the first Apostle sent by Allah to the people  of the Earth.&#8217; They will go to Noah who will reply, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking,&#8217;  and mention the mistake which he made, and add, &#8216;But you&#8217;d better go to Abraham, Khalil  Ar-Rahman.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will go to Abraham who will reply, &#8216;I am not fit for  this undertaking,&#8217; and mention to them the mistakes he made, and add, &#8216;But you&#8217;d better go  to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and to whom He spoke directly&#8217; They will go to  Moses who will reply, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking,&#8217; and mention to them the  mistakes he made, and add, &#8216;You&#8217;d better go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle and  His Word (Be: And it was) and a soul created by Him.&#8217; They will go to Jesus who will say,  &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking, but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad whose sins of the past  and the future had been forgiven (by Allah).&#8217; So they will come to me and I will ask the  permission of my Lord, and I will be permitted (to present myself) before Him. When I see  my Lord, I will fall down in (prostration) before Him and He will leave me (in  prostration) as long as He wishes, and then it will be said to me, &#8216;O Muhammad! Raise your  head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your  request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will then raise my  head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will  intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a  limit whom I will admit into Paradise. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will come back again, and when I see my Lord (again), I  will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as  He wishes, and then He will say, &#8216;O Muhammad!

Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain  kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise, I will return  again, and when I see my Lord, I will fall down (in prostration) and He will leave me (in  prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &#8216;O Muhammad!

Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &#8216; La ilaha  illal-lah,&#8217; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain.

Be afraid of  Allah! &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Allah). He  trusts me over the people of the earth, but you do not trust me?&#8221; A man from the  people (present then), who, I think, was Khalid bin Al-Walid, asked for permission to kill  him, but the Prophet prevented him. When the man went away, the Prophet said, &#8220;Out of  the offspring of this man, there will be people who will recite the Quran but it will not  go beyond their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the  game, and they will kill the Muslims and leave the idolators.

Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the  sun when there are no clouds?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;So you will see Him, like that. Allah will gather all the people on the Day of  Resurrection, and say, &#8216;Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that  thing),&#8217; so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the  moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he  will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or  its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come to them and say,  &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will (deny Him and) say, &#8216;We will stay here till our Lord comes,  for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.&#8217; So Allah will come to them in His  appearance which they know, and will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;You are our  Lord,&#8217; so they will follow Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)&#8217; I and my  followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except  the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, &#8216;O Allah, save!  Save!&#8217; In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan  (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa&#8217;dan? &#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan, but none  knows how big they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according to  their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil)  deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be  punished and then relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He  will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to  take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom  Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the  right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks  of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except  the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of  prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of  life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the  mud of the torrent. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and  there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the  people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Please turn my face away from  the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.&#8217; So he will invoke  Allah in the way Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, &#8216;If I  grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will reply, &#8216;No, by Your Power,  (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.&#8217; He will give his Lord whatever promises and  covenants Allah will demand. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he  will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah will wish  him to remain quiet, then he will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.&#8217;  Allah will say to him, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give your promises and covenants that you would never  ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam&#8217;s son! How  treacherous you are!&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my lord,&#8217; and will keep on invoking Allah till He  says to him, &#8216;If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will  reply, &#8216;No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then  Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise,  Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures  whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he  will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give your  covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been  given?&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Woe on you, O Adam&#8217;s son! How treacherous you are! &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The man will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most  miserable of Your creation,&#8217; and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will laugh  because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of him, He will say to him,  &#8216;Enter Paradise,&#8217; and when he will enter it, Allah will say to him, &#8216;Wish for anything.&#8217;  So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself  will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, &#8216;(Wish for) so-and-so.&#8217; When there  is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, &#8216;This is for you, and its equal (is for you)  as well.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yazid added: Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri who was present  with Abu Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira said that  Allah had said, &#8220;That is for you and its equal as well,&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri  said, &#8220;And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I do not  remember, except his saying, &#8216;That is for you and its equal as well.'&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id  Al-Khudri then said, &#8220;I testify that I remember the Prophet saying, &#8216;That is for you,  and ten times as much.&#8217; &#8216; Abu Huraira then added, &#8220;That man will be the last person  of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 532s: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on  the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun  and the moon when the sky is clear?&#8221; We said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So you  will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in  seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Somebody  will then announce, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&#8217; So the companions  of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and  the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain  those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some  of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a  mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &#8220;What did you use to worship?&#8217; They will  reply, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are  liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&#8217; They will reply,  &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; Then it will be said to them &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they  will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &#8216;What did you  use to worship?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will reply, &#8216;We used to worship Messiah, the son of  Allah.&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do  you want (now)?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; It will be said to  them, &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who  used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be  said to them, &#8216;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We  parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we  heard the call of one proclaiming, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&#8217;  and now we are waiting for our Lord.&#8217; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other  than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &#8216;I am your Lord,&#8217; and they  will say, &#8216;You are not our Lord.&#8217; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and  then it will be said to them, &#8216;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&#8217; They  will say. &#8216;The Shin,&#8217; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer  will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him  just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate  but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to  prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&#8221; We, the companions of the  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the bridge?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8220;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are  clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and  has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&#8217;dan.  Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others  as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe  without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall  down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the  bridge).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming  from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding  with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will say, &#8216;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they)  used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Go  and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one  (gold) Dinar.&#8217; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go  to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle  of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will  return, and Allah will say (to them), &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you  find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&#8217; They will take out whomever they will  recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose  heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will  take out all those whom they will recognize.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: If you do not believe  me then read the Holy Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or  a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&#8217; (4.40) The Prophet added,  &#8220;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the  Almighty (Allah) will say, &#8216;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of  the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they  will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the  torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the  side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those  people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden)  necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say,  &#8216;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise  without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for  themselves).&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;For you is what you have seen and its  equivalent as well.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 532v: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The believers will be kept  (waiting) on the Day of Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say,  &#8220;Let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from  our place. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are Adam, the  father of the people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His  Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all  things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place  of ours? Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will mention his mistakes  he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He  will add, &#8216;Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&#8217; The  people will go to Noah who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking&#8217; He will mention  his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.&#8217; He will say  (to them), &#8216;Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&#8217; They will go to Abraham who will say, &#8216;I am  not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say  (to them). &#8216;Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and  brought near Him, for conversation.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will go to Moses who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this  undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to  them), &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His  Word.&#8217; (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this  undertaking but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been  forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord&#8217;s permission to enter  His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration  before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will  say, &#8216;O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede,  for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:&#8217;  Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me.  Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them  out and make them enter Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the  Prophet said, &#8220;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter  Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I  will be permitted. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before  Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and  then He will say, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and  intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.&#8217;  &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He  has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a  certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada  added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &#8216;I will go out and take them out of  Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask  my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him,  and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, &#8216;Raise your head,  O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession  will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and  praise Allah as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me  (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter  Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &#8220;So I will  go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain  in the Fire except those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for  eternal life in the fire).&#8221; The narrator then recited the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;It may be  that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.&#8217; (17.79) The narrator  added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet. </font></p>

You are the Truth, and  Your saying is the Truth, and Your promise is the Truth, and the meeting with You is the  Truth, and Paradise is the Truth, and the (Hell) Fire is the Truth. O Allah! I surrender  myself to You, and believe in You, and I put my trust in You (solely depend upon). And to  You I complain of my opponents and with Your Evidence I argue. So please forgive the sins  which I have done in the past or I will do in the future, and also those (sins) which I  did in secret or in public, and that which You know better than I. None has the right to  be worshipped but You.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original  state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve  months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are in succession, namely,  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between  Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; The Prophet then asked us, &#8220;Which month is  this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&#8221; He kept quiet so  long that we thought he might call it by another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it  Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked &#8220;What town is this?&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&#8217; Then he kept quiet so long that we  thought he might call it by another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the (forbidden)  town (Mecca)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is the day today?&#8221;  We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better. Then he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might call it by another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the Day of  An-Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifices)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said,  &#8220;Your blood (lives), your properties,&#8221; (the sub narrator Muhammad, said: I think  he also said): &#8220;..and your honor) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of  this Day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>You shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about your  deeds. Beware! Don&#8217;t go astray after me by striking the necks of one another. Lo! It is  incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the  informed one might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present  audience.&#8221; Whenever the sub-narrator Muhammad mentioned that statement, he would say,  &#8220;The Prophet said the truth.&#8221;) And then the Prophet added, &#8220;No doubt!  Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to you! No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to  you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A son of one of the daughters of the Prophet was dying, so  she sent a person to call the Prophet. He sent (her a message), &#8220;What ever Allah  takes is for Him, and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything has a limited fixed  term (in this world) so she should be patient and hope for Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; She then  sent for him again, swearing that he should come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up, and so did  Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b and &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit. When he entered (the house), they  gave the child to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while its breath was disturbed in his chest. (The  sub-narrator said: I think he said, &#8220;&#8230;as if it was a water skin.&#8221;) Allah&#8217;s  Apostle started weeping whereupon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;Do you weep?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to  others).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Paradise and Hell (Fire) quarrelled  in the presence of their Lord. Paradise said, &#8216;O Lord! What is wrong with me that only the  poor and humble people enter me ?&#8217; Hell (Fire) said, I have been favored with the arrogant  people.&#8217; So Allah said to Paradise, &#8216;You are My Mercy,&#8217; and said to Hell, &#8216;You are My  Punishment which I inflict upon whom I wish, and I shall fill both of you.'&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;As for Paradise, (it will be filled with good people) because Allah  does not wrong any of His created things, and He creates for Hell (Fire) whomever He will,  and they will be thrown into it, and it will say thrice, &#8216;Is there any more, till Allah  (will put) His Foot over it and it will become full and its sides will come close to each  other and it will say, &#8216;Qat! Qat! Qat! (Enough! Enough! Enough!) . </font></p>

Allah will put the Heavens on one finger and the earth on one finger, and the  trees and the rivers on one finger, and the rest of the creation on one finger, and then  will say, pointing out with His Hand, &#8216;I am the King.&#8217; &#8220;On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle  smiled and said, &#8220;No just estimate have they made of Allah such as due to Him.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I stayed overnight at the house of (my aunt ) Maimuna  while the Prophet was with her, to see how was the night prayer of Allah s Apostle Allah&#8217;s  Apostle talked to his wife for a while and then slept. When it was the last third of the  night (or part of it), the Prophet got up and looked towards the sky and recited the  Verse:&#8211; &#8216;Verily! In the creation of the Heavens and the Earth&#8230;.there are indeed signs  for the men of understanding.&#8217; (3.190) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then He got up and performed the ablution, brushed his  teeth and offered eleven Rakat.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle the true and truly inspired, narrated to  us, &#8220;The creation of everyone of you starts with the process of collecting the  material for his body within forty days and forty nights in the womb of his mother. Then  he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period (40 days) and then he becomes like a  piece of flesh for a similar period. Then an angel is sent to him (by Allah) and the angel  is allowed (ordered) to write four things; his livelihood, his (date of) death, his deeds,  and whether he will be a wretched one or a blessed one (in the Hereafter) and then the  soul is breathed into him. So one of you may do (good) deeds characteristic of the people  of Paradise so much that there is nothing except a cubit between him and Paradise but then  what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds  characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) and (ultimately) enters Hell (Fire); and one  of you may do (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) so much so that  there is nothing except a cubit between him and Hell (Fire), then what has been written  for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (good) deeds characteristic of the people  of Paradise and ultimately) enters Paradise.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 4) </font></p>

The people  of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted upon it till midday, and then they were  worn out and were given for their labor, one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel  were given the Gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then  they were worn out and were given (for their labor), one Qirat each. Then you people were  given the Quran and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two Qirats each  (double the reward of the previous nations).&#8221; Then the people of the Torah said, &#8216;O  our Lord! These people have done a little labor (much less than we) but have taken a  greater reward.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Have I withheld anything from your reward?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217;  Then Allah said, &#8216;That is My Favor which I bestow on whom I wish.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

Forgive me if You wish,&#8217; or &#8216;Bestow Your Mercy on me if You wish,&#8217; or &#8216;Provide me with  means of subsistence if You wish,&#8217; but he should be firm in his request, for Allah does  what He will and nobody can force Him (to do anything).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he differed with Al-Hurr bin Qais bin Hisn Al-Fazari  about the companion of Moses, (i.e., whether he was Kha,dir or not). Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  Al-Ansari passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him saying, &#8216;My friend (Hur) and I have  differed about Moses&#8217; Companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Did you hear Allah&#8217;s  Apostle mentioning anything about him?&#8221; Ubai said, &#8220;Yes, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle  saying, &#8220;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites a man came to him  and asked, &#8216;Do you know Someone who is more learned than you (Moses)?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;No.&#8217;  So Allah sent the Divine inspiration to Moses:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you&#8217; Moses  asked Allah how to meet him ( Khadir) So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and it was  said to him, &#8216;When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where you lose it) and you  will meet him.&#8217; So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The boy  servant of Moses (who was accompanying him) said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened)  when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget to tell you (about) the fish.  None but Satan made me forget to tell you about it&#8217; (18.63) Moses said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;That is what we have been seeking.&#8221; Sa they went back  retracing their footsteps. (18.64). So they both found Kadir (there) and then happened  what Allah mentioned about them (in the Quran)!&#8217; (See 18.60-82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.&#8217;  (17.110) That is, &#8216;Do not say your prayer so loudly that the pagans can hear you, nor say  it in such a low tone that your companions do not hear you.&#8217; But seek a middle course  between those (extremes), i.e., let your companions hear, but do not relate the Qur&#8217;an  loudly, so that they may learn it from you. </font></p>

When his death approached, he said to his sons, &#8220;What kind of father  have I been to you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;You have been a good father.&#8221; He told  them that he had not presented any good deed before Allah, and if Allah should get hold of  him He would punish him.&#8217; &#8220;So look!&#8221; he added, &#8220;When I die, burn me, and  when I turn into coal, crush me, and when there comes a windy day, scatter my ashes in the  wind.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then by Allah, he took a firm promise from his  children to do so, and they did so. (They burnt him after his death) and threw his ashes  on a windy day. Then Allah commanded to his ashes. &#8220;Be,&#8221; and behold! He became a  man standing! Allah said, &#8220;O My slave! What made you do what you did?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;For fear of You.&#8221; Nothing saved him then but Allah&#8217;s Mercy (So Allah  forgave him). </font></p>

Admit into Paradise (even) those  who have faith equal to a mustard seed in their hearts.&#8221; Such people will enter  Paradise, and then I will say, &#8216;O (Allah) admit into Paradise (even) those who have the  least amount of faith in their hearts.&#8221; Anas then said: As if I were just now looking  at the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ma&#8217;bad bin Hilal Al&#8217;Anzi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas  bin Malik, and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him about  the Hadith of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in his palace, and our arrival  coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter and he admitted us while he  was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, &#8220;Do not ask him about anything else first  but the Hadith of Intercession.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren  from Basra coming to ask you about the Hadith of Intercession.&#8221; Anas then said,  &#8220;Muhammad talked to us saying, &#8216;On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with  each other like waves, and then they will come to Adam and say, &#8216;Please intercede for us  with your Lord.&#8217; He will say, &#8216;I am not fit for that but you&#8217;d better go to Abraham as he  is the Khalil of the Beneficent.&#8217; They will go to Abraham and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit  for that, but you&#8217;d better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.&#8217; So  they will go to Moses and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for that, but you&#8217;d better go to  Jesus as he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.&#8217; (Be: And it was) they will go to  Jesus and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for that, but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They would come to me and I would say, &#8216;I am for that.&#8217;  Then I will ask for my Lord&#8217;s permission, and it will be given, and then He will inspire  me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those  praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise  your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted (your  request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my  followers! My followers!&#8217; And then it will be said, &#8216;Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all  those who have faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.&#8217; I will go  and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before  Him. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be  listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your  intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&#8217; It will  be said, &#8216;Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the  weight of a small ant or a mustard seed.&#8217; I will go and do so and return to praise Him  with the same praises, and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, &#8216;O,  Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be  granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will  say, &#8216;O Lord, my followers!&#8217; Then He will say, &#8216;Go and take out (all those) in whose  hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the  Fire.&#8217; I will go and do so.&#8221;&#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions,  &#8220;Let&#8217;s pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request  him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.&#8221; So we went to him and we greeted him  and he admitted us. We said to him, &#8220;O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother  Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I  have never heard.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; Then we told him of the Hadith  and said, &#8220;He stopped at this point (of the Hadith).&#8221; He said, &#8220;What  then?&#8221; We said, &#8220;He did not add anything to that.&#8221; He said, Anas related  the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don&#8217;t know whether he  forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.&#8221; We said,  &#8220;O Abu Said ! Let us know that.&#8221; He smiled and said, &#8220;Man was created  hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the  Prophet added, &#8216;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate  before Him me the same as he &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be  listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your  intercession will be accepted .&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever  said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&#8217; Then Allah will say, &#8216;By my  Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell  (Fire) whoever said: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

I am the King!'&#8221; I  saw the Prophet smiling till his premolar teeth became visible expressing his amazement  and his belief in what he had said.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The night Allah&#8217;s Apostle was taken for a journey from the  sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka&#8217;ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was  sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of  them said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221; The middle (second) angel said, &#8220;He is  the best of them.&#8221; The last (third) angle said, &#8220;Take the best of them.&#8221;  Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another  night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258,  Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not&#8212;-and so is the case  with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did  not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zam-Zam. From  among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his  throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and  abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the  inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom  was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then  closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on  one of its doors. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The dwellers of the Heaven asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; He said,  &#8220;Gabriel.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Who is accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Muhammad.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Has he been called?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;  They said, &#8220;He is welcomed.&#8221; So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with  his arrival, and they did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet on earth unless  Allah informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the  Prophet, &#8220;He is your father; greet him.&#8221; The Prophet greeted him and Adam  returned his greeting and said, &#8220;Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!&#8221;  Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, &#8220;What  are these two rivers, O Gabriel?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;These are the sources of the  Nile and the Euphrates.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw  another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put  his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, &#8220;What is this,  O Gabriel?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for  you.&#8221; Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the  same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Gabriel replied,  &#8220;Gabriel&#8221;. They asked, &#8220;Who is accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Muhammad.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Has he been sent for?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;He is welcomed.&#8221; Then he (Gabriel) ascended with  the Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first  and the second Heavens had said. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they  said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same;  and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended  with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets  whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on  the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don&#8217;t remember, on the fifth Heaven,  Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of  talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), &#8220;O Lord! I thought that none would  be raised up above me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance  above that, the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond  which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached  and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said  that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263,  264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: &#8220;Fifty prayers  were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then  Moses stopped him and asked, &#8220;O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?&#8221;  The Prophet replied,&#8221; He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a  night.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord  may reduce it for you and for them.&#8221; So the Prophet turned to Gabriel as if he wanted  to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, &#8220;Yes, if  you wish.&#8221; So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in  his place, &#8220;O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that.&#8221;  So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him  again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to  only five prayers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to  five and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to  do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are  weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten  your burden.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel  did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet said,  &#8220;O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so  lighten our burden.&#8221; On that the Irresistible said, &#8220;O Muhammad!&#8221; the  Prophet replied, &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik.&#8221; Allah said, &#8220;The Word that comes  from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the  Book.&#8221; Allah added, &#8220;Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is  fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in  practice).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, &#8220;What have  you done?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good  deed a tenfold reward.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;By Allah! I tried to make Bani Israel  observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten  your burden further.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of  returning too many times to my Lord.&#8221; On that Gabriel said, &#8220;Descend in Allah&#8217;s  Name.&#8221; The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca). </font></p>

On that Allah will say (to him),  &#8220;Take, here you are, O son of Adam, for nothing satisfies you.&#8217; &#8220;On that the  bedouin said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O the group of Muslims!  How can you ask the people of the Scriptures about anything while your Book which Allah  has revealed to your Prophet contains the most recent news from Allah and is pure and not  distorted? Allah has told you that the people of the Scriptures have changed some of  Allah&#8217;s Books and distorted it and wrote something with their own hands and said, &#8216;This is  from Allah, so as to have a minor gain for it. Won&#8217;t the knowledge that has come to you  stop you from asking them? No, by Allah, we have never seen a man from them asking you  about that (the Book Al-Qur&#8217;an ) which has been revealed to you. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;id bin Jubair reported from Ibn &#8216;Abbas (regarding the  explanation of the Verse: &#8216;Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste  therewith) . He said, &#8220;The Prophet used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the  Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said (to Sa&#8217;id), &#8220;I move  them (my lips) as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to move his lips.&#8221; And Said said (to me),  &#8220;I move my lips as I saw Ibn &#8216;Abbas moving his lips,&#8221; and then he moved his  lips. So Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;(O Muhammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the  Qur&#8217;an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the  ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).&#8217;  (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then follow  you its recital.&#8217; (75.18) This means, &#8220;You should listen to it and keep quiet and  then it is upon Us to make you recite it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The narrator added, &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to listen  whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet would recite the Qur&#8217;an  as Gabriel had recited it to him.&#8221; </font></p>

Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.&#8217; (17.110) This Verse was revealed  while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hiding himself at Mecca. At that time, when he led his  companions in prayer, he used to raise his voice while reciting the Qur&#8217;an; and if the  pagans heard him, they would abuse the Qur&#8217;an, its Revealer, and the one who brought it.  So Allah said to His Prophet: &#8220;Neither say your prayer aloud. i.e., your recitation  (of Qur&#8217;an) lest the pagans should hear (it) and abuse the Quran&#8221; nor say it in a low  tone, &#8220;lest your voice should fail to reach your companions, &#8220;but follow a way  between.&#8221; (17.110) </font></p>

The people of the Torah were given  the Torah and they acted on it till midday and then they were unable to carry on. And they  were given (a reward equal to) one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given  the Gospel and they acted on it till &#8216;Asr Prayer and then they were unable to carry on, so  they were given la reward equal to) one Qirat each. Then you were given the Qur&#8217;an and you  acted on it till sunset, therefore you were given (a reward equal to) two Qirats each.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Before Allah created  the creations, He wrote a Book (wherein He has written): My Mercy has preceded my  Anger.&#8221; and that (Book) is written with Him over the Throne.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 644: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zahdam: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There were good relations and brotherhood between this  tribe of Jurm and the Ash&#8217;ariyyin. Once, while we were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari,  there was brought to him a meal which contained chicken meat, and there was sitting beside  him, a man from the tribe of Bani Taimul-lah who looked like one of the Mawali. Abu Musa  invited the man to eat but the man said, &#8220;I have seen chicken eating some dirty  things, and I have taken an oath not to eat chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said to him,  &#8220;Come along, let me tell you something in this regard. Once I went to the Prophet  with a few men from Ash&#8217;ariyyin and we asked him for mounts. The Prophet said, By Allah, I  will not mount you on anything; besides I do not have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a  few camels from the war booty were brought to the Prophet, and he asked about us, saying,  &#8216;Where are the group of Ash&#8217;ariyyin?&#8217; So he ordered for five fat camels to be given to us  and then we set out. We said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle took an oath that he  would not give us anything to ride and that he had nothing for us to ride, yet he provided  us with mounts. We made Allah&#8217;s Apostle forget his oath! By Allah, we will never be  successful.&#8217; So we returned to him and reminded him of his oath. He said, &#8216;I have not  provided you with the mount, but Allah has done so. By Allah, I may take an oath to do  something, but on finding something else which is better, I do that which is better and  make the expiation for my oath.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The delegates of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;The pagans of the tribe of Mudar intervene between you and us therefore we  cannot come to you except in the Holy months. So please order us to do something good  (Religious deeds) by which we may enter Paradise (by acting on them) and we may inform our  people whom we have left behind to observe it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you  to do four things and forbid you from four things: I order you to believe in Allah. Do you  know what is meant by belief in Allah? It is to testify that none has the right to be  worshipped except Allah, to offer prayers perfectly, to give Zakat, and to give Al-Khumus  (one-fifth of the war booty) (in Allah&#8217;s Cause). And I forbid you four things, (i.e., Do  not drink alcoholic drinks) Ad-Dubba, An-Naqir, (pitched water skins), Az-Zuruf,  Al-Muzaffat and Al&#8211;Hantam (names of utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic  drinks).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1) </font></p>

And the believer who does not recite the Quran is like a date which has a good taste but  no smell. And the example of an impious person who recites the Qur&#8217;an is that of Ar-Rihana  (an aromatic plant) which smells good but is bitter in taste.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people asked the Prophet regarding the soothsayers. He  said, &#8220;They are nothing.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Some of their  talks come true.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;That word which happens to be true is what  a Jinn snatches away by stealth (from the Heaven) and pours it in the ears of his friend  (the foreteller) with a sound like the cackling of a hen. The soothsayers then mix with  that word, one hundred lies.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There will emerge from the East  some people who will recite the Qur&#8217;an but it will not exceed their throats and who will  go out of (renounce) the religion (Islam) as an arrow passes through the game, and they  will never come back to it unless the arrow, comes back to the middle of the bow (by  itself) (i.e., impossible). The people asked, &#8220;What will their signs be?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Their sign will be the habit of shaving (of their beards). (Fateh Al-Bari,  Page 322, Vol. 17th) </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><b>No excuses are accepted regarding the Fundamentals of Tawhid</b><b> </b></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><b style="color:#000000;"></b><b></b><b>Q:</b><b> Can a person be excused for their ignorance regarding the fundamentals of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) </b>which represent the core of Din (religion)? What is the ruling on judging specific people as being Kafirs (disbelievers) for indulging in practices of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) out of their ignorance?</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">A: No person can be excused for their ignorance regarding issues of Tawhid so long as they live amongst Muslims. However, whoever lives far away from Muslim areas and is ignorant of Islam, they will be judged by Allah (Glorified be He). They will be dealt with in the same way as Ahl-ul-Fatrah (people having no access to Divine Messages) on the Day of Resurrection i.e. they will be tested there and judged accordingly.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">On the other hand, whoever lives amongst Muslims and hears the Word of Allah and His Messenger without adhering to them but instead worships the graves and seeks their help or insults Din, such people are Kafirs (disbelievers). Muslim authorities have to ask such people to repent and if they do not, they have to be killed for their Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">The same applies to whoever mocks the Din, considers Halal (lawful) things that Allah declares as being Haram (prohibited) such as Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), Khamr (intoxicant), applying positive law, judging by laws other than what Allah has revealed, or claiming that such laws are better than the laws which are set by Allah. Declaring any of the foregoing as Halal is tantamount to committing Riddah (apostasy), we seek refuge with Allah from this. It is thus Wajib (obligatory) on every Islamic government to apply Shari`ah (Islamic law), to advise whoever indulges in any of the practices which revoke their Islam to make Tawbah (repentance to Allah), and to kill them if they refuse to give up their Kufr.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Proof for this is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Whoever(aMuslim)discardstheirDin,killthem"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18055" class="tip"></span>Whoever (a Muslim) discards their Din, kill them.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> (Related by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadiths). Moreover, it is reported in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="OntheauthorityofMuadhibn"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="25525" class="tip"></span>on the authority of Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that he ordered some rulers to kill the apostates if they do not make Tawbah. Mu`adh said: &#8216;This is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger&#8217;.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">However, such a judgment has to be applied by the Muslim ruler and through the Shar`y (Islamic legal) courts. This is to ensure that the ruling of Allah is implemented on the basis of true knowledge and insight of Muslim authorities. May Allah set right the affairs of us all. Verily, Allah is the All Hearer, the Most Near.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#000000;text-align:center;"><b>Avoiding recitations for healing or protection that violate Shari`ah</b></p>
<p>From<a id="ContentAnchor" href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" name="Abdul-AzizibnAbdullahibnBaz"> `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz </a>to all Muslims in the district of Al-Far` and other districts of Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, may Allah guide you to have insight into the religion of Islam, Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s peace, mercy and blessings be upon you. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been informed that in your district there is an incantation against scorpions and other poisonous creatures, and that this incantation contains statements of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). That is why I see I have to warn you against such Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is the text of some of such Ruqyahs referred to above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">(In the Name of Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Words! By the seven heavens and the revealed Ayahs that rule but not ruled! O Sulayman Al-Rifa`y! O fighter of scorpions&#8217; poison! Call scorpions in the name of Al-Rifa`y, both female scorpions and male ones, both long scorpions and short ones, both red scorpions and white ones, and both big scorpions and small ones against the evil of scorpions creeping both in the evening and in the morning. I seek help against them from Allah, His Ayahs, ninety nine prophets, Fatimah, the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and her offspring).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These words are only some of the incantations I have been informed of. They have many formulas, which all involve Shirk. There could be no doubt that such incantations include <strong>statements of Shirk</strong>, such as, &#8220;<strong>By the seven heavens</strong>,&#8221; and, &#8220;<strong>O<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Sulayman Al-Rifa`y! </span>O fighter of scorpions&#8217; poison! Call scorpions in the name of</strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong> Al-Rifa`y</strong>,&#8221; </span>and, &#8220;<strong>I seek help against them from Allah, His Ayahs, ninety-nine prophets, and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fatimah, </span>the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and her offspring</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah stress that Allah Alone is the only One worthy of worship and no one should be invoked or asked for help except Allah (Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Fatihah, 1: 5" target="_blank" name="You(Alone)weworship,andYou"></a><span style="color:#008000;">You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 18" target="_blank" name="AndthemosquesareforAll%C3%A2h(Alone):"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allâh</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Dua(supplication)is(theessenceof)worship"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18029" class="tip"></span>Du&#8217;a` (supplication) is (the essence of) worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He(peace be upon him) also said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Ifyoubeg,begofAllahAlone;"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="23001503" class="tip"></span>If you beg, beg of Allah Alone; and if you need assistance, supplicate to Allah Alone for help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Prophetic Hadiths that stress this meaning. Moreover, Muslim scholars unanimously agree that appealing to the heavens, stars, idols, trees, and so on, for help is as an act of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, they unanimously agree that it is not permissible to invoke the dead or seek their help whether they were prophets, righteous people or others. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Whenamandies,hisdeedscome"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="14124" class="tip"></span>When a man dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), knowledge by which people benefit, or a pious son who prays for him (the deceased).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Ruqyah referred to above includes some statements like asking the heavens, the dead, including prophets,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Rifa`y, </span>and others for help. All this is regarded as an act of Shirk.</span> Thus, all Muslims should be cautious about such Ruqyahs and similar incantations that contain statements of Shirk. Moreover, Muslims should advise and warn one another against such Ruqyahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should resort to legal Ruqyahs (i.e. reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), such as Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur&#8217;anic Verse of Allah&#8217;s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255), Surah Al-Ikhlas, Surah Al-Falaq, Surah Al-Nas and other Ayahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in addition to supplications for refuge and protection prescribed by Shari`ah (Islamic law), such as seeking refuge with Allah&#8217;s Perfect Words from the evil of His creation. Also, a Muslim can say three times in the morning and in the evening: <a style="color:blue;" name="IntheNameofAllah,withWhose"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11111" class="tip"></span>In the Name of Allah, with Whose Name nothing can be harmful on the earth or in the heaven, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.</span> Also, there is the Islamic Ruqyah for the sick and for people who are stung in which a Muslim can say three times: <a style="color:blue;" name="Removetheaffliction,OLordof"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11113" class="tip"></span>Remove the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and bring about healing, as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing; a healing that leaves behind no ailment.</span> <a style="color:blue;" name="IntheNameofAllahIperform"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11191" class="tip"></span>In the Name of Allah I perform Ruqyah for you, from everything that may harm you; from the evil of any soul or envious eye. May Allah heal you. In the Name of Allah I perform Ruqyah for you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, reciting Surah Al-Fatihah over the sick and the people who are stung is one of the greatest causes of cure, especially when recitation is performed sincerely and truthfully asking Allah (Exalted be He) to grant healing with full faith that Allah (Exalted be He) is the Only One who Cures and that no one can cure people from a diseases except Him (Glorified be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">I ask Allah to guide us and all Muslims to have insight into His Religion and to steadfastly adhere to it. I ask Him to protect us from all that violates His Laws. Indeed, He is the Most Generous and the Most Beneficent. May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy and Blessings be upon you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported from Amir Al-Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he <strong>condemned pursuing the monuments of prophets</strong> and ordered that the tree under which the Bay`ah of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Hudaybiyah </span><span style="color:#000000;">took place be cut, when he learned that some people began going there. This was meant to protect Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and eliminate the means leading to Shirk, Bid`ah and superstitions related to Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Below is some of what was mentioned by some scholars in this regard, so that you will be well informed about this matter.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Al-Walid Al-Tartushy</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">said in his book &#8216;<strong>Al-Hawadith wal-Bida</strong>`&#8217;, a chapter entitled &#8216;A Chapter on Forms of Bid`ah&#8217;, p. 135,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Al-Ma`rur ibn Suwayd </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8216;When we went to perform Hajj with</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him), we saw a Masjid (mosque) on the way, so people began offering Salah (Prayer) in it.&#8217;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8220;O, people! Those who were before you perished because of honoring such sites, until they took them as places of worship. If one arrives there at the time of Salah, one should offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.'&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">On p. 141, he said on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muhammad ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">that</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">ordered that the tree under which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given the Bay`ah be cut, because people began to visit it and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">feared that they might be misled.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah</span><span style="color:#000000;">said:</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Malik </span><span style="color:#000000;">and other scholars of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Madinah </span><span style="color:#000000;">hated going to the Masjids and Islamic monuments in Al-Madinah except</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Quba&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Uhud. </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Sufyan </span><span style="color:#000000;">entered</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Aqsa Mosque </span><span style="color:#000000;">and offered Salah there, but he did not inquire about those monuments or offer Salah there; and others who imitated him did the same.&#8221;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">then said: &#8220;How many matters are now considered acceptable by many people that were once considered Munkar. People try to get closer to Allah through means that drive them further from Allah.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh-ul-Islam</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) said in his book &#8216;<strong>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</strong>&#8216;, Vol. 26, P. 133:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="AsforclimbingMountAl-Rahmah"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;As for climbing Mount Al-Rahmah (at<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Arafah) </span>it is neither an act of Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) nor Mustahab (desirable).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Nor is it Mustahab to enter the dome above it, called the Dome of Adam, to offer Salah there, or circumambulate it, as this is one of the major sins.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">It is neither Mustahab to enter the Masjids at the place of Jamarat (stone pillars at which pebbles are thrown during Hajj) or offer Salah there. Circumambulation around them, the Stone, the room of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or anything other than the Ka`bah is a grave Bid`ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He also said on p. 144 of the same section, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;As for visiting the Masjids that were built in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), such as the one by the foot of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Safa, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the one by the</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> foot of Abu Qubays,</span><span style="color:#000000;">and such Masjids that were built at the sites of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah, such as Masjid Al-Mawlid (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday) and others, it is neither a Sunnah to visit these places, nor was it preferable by any of the Imams. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is only permissible to visit</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">in particular, and the sacred ritual places, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mina, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. </span><span style="color:#000000;">However, visiting the mountains and areas around</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina, </span><span style="color:#000000;">such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Hira&#8217; Mountain, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the mountain at</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina </span><span style="color:#000000;">where it is claimed that there was the sacrifice dome and such places. It is not a Sunnah related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but rather a Bid`ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">The same applies to the Masjids built at the sites said to be monuments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not permit visiting any of these.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In vol. 27, p. 134, of the same book, he also said:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="Somepeoplemightaskwhetherit"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;Some people might ask whether it is permissible to glorify a place where there is worn-out things and saffron as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was seen there. Glorification of such places and turning them into Masjids is an imitation of the People of the Book whom we are prohibited to imitate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">It was authentically reported that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) was traveling when he saw a group of people hurrying to a place. He asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; People replied, &#8216;It is a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do you want to turn the sites of your prophet into Masjids? If the time of Salah comes while a person is there, they can offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said this in the presence of a number of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah in many places while traveling, and the people would see him in their sleep in different places. However, the Salaf did not turn any of these into Masjids or tourist sites. If this door is opened, many of the Muslim lands will be turned into Masjids and tourist sites, as people still dream that the Prophet (peace be upon him) visits them at home. Establishing such tourist sites is a loathed Bid`ah. Allah has not ordered that the places of prophets be turned into a Musalla (a place for Prayer) except Maqam Ibrahim (the Station of Ibrahim) in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 125" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenWemadethe"></a>And take you (people) the Maqâm (place) of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. Two Rak‘at after the Tawâf of the Ka‘bahat Makkah)<img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">He has neither ordered that a stone be touched and kissed except Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (the Black Stone in a corner of the Ka`bah), or Salah be directed to a building other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred House, another name for the Ka`bah). According to the Ijma` (consensus) of the Muslims, it is impermissible to make analogies in this matter. It is tantamount to asking the people to perform Hajj to a place other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-`Atiq </span><span style="color:#000000;">or observe Sawm (fasting) in a month other than Ramadan, and so on.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The rest of the issues have been definitely answered. If a person offers Salah or recites Du`a&#8217; (supplication) intentionally at the place of a prophet&#8217;s footprints or site; the grave of a Sahaby (Companion of the Prophet), a sheikh, or one of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family), a tower or a cave, this is a rejected Bid`ah in Islam, as neither the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) nor the early generation of Muslims or those who followed them in righteousness did so. Not one of the Muslim Imams preferred it; rather, it is a means leading to Shirk.&#8221; There is elaboration on this elsewhere. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said on p. 500 in the same section,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;After Islam, none of the Sahabah used to go to Hira&#8217; Cave on purpose. It is impermissible for us to seek the caves of mountains or sit in seclusion there&#8230;As for sitting in seclusion in caves and traveling for a mountain to seek blessings, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tur Mountain, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Hira&#8217;, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Thawr </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others, it is impermissible for us. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Donotsetoutonajourneyexcept"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18171" class="tip"></span>Do not set out on a journey except to three Masjids: Al-Masjid Al-Haram, this mosque of mine (the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque), and Al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem).</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) wrote on p. 204 of his book <strong>Ighathat Al-Lahfan min Masa&#8217;id Al-Shaytan</strong>, after warning against visiting graves to seek blessings in them and recite Du`a&#8217; there:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><a style="color:#000000;" name="TheSahabahdisapprovedofthings"></a><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;The Sahabah disapproved of things much more trivial than this. Many people narrated from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Ma&#8217;rur ibn Suwayd </span>that he offered Fajr (Dawn) Prayer with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) on the way to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then people began spreading everywhere. He asked, &#8216;Where are these people going?&#8217; It was said, &#8216;O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin, they go to offer Salah in a Masjid where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Those who were before you perished because of this; they used to follow the traces of their prophets and turn them into places of `Ibadah. If the time of Salah comes while you are in such places, offer Salah there; otherwise you should leave, and do not go there intentionally.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also uprooted the tree under which the Sahabah made the Bay`ah to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Scholars stated much about this issue. We hope that what we have already mentioned is enough and convincing for those who seek the truth. Having known the previously mentioned pieces of evidence from Shari`ah and the opinions of scholars on this issue, you would know that the call of the writer for glorifying Islamic monuments, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Thawr Cave, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the place where Al-Rudwan Bay`ah took place and others; reconstructing what was demolished of them; paving roads leading to them; making elevators or cable cars for high places such as the two mentioned caves; turning them into tourist sites; erecting signs to them; and appointing tourist guides for the visitors is all contrary to Islamic Shari`ah, which provides for achieving and boosting interests, and preventing and curbing evil, as well as blocking the means leading to Shirk and Bid`ah. You would also know that we should prevent Bid`ah and the means leading to Shirk, even if those who call for them have good intentions, as they lead to great evil, change the rites of Islam, and create new places and forms of `Ibadah that were not prescribed by Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Anything that was not prescribed in the era of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) cannot be made permissible later. If this door is opened, Islam will be misrepresented and innovated ideas will enter it. Muslims will thus become like</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Jews </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Christians </span><span style="color:#000000;">in their manipulating their faiths and changing them according to their whims and desires. That is why Imam</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Malik ibn Anas, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Imam of Madinah (may Allah be merciful to him), made a great statement that all the scholars agreed upon, saying: &#8220;The last generations of this Ummah (nation) will not succeeded except when they resort to what made the former followers succeed.&#8221; He meant that what brought success to the first generation was adherence to the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), following their rules and avoiding what contradicts them. The last generations of this Ummah will not succeed unless they resort to what made the former generations succeed. He (may Allah be merciful to him) has spoken the truth. When people corrupted their faith, created Bid`ah and founded new ways, they divided into different sects, became confused with every sect rejoicing in what they had. Their enemies attacked them, taking advantage of discrepancy among them, weakness of faith, difference in intentions, and fanaticism of every sect to their misleading ways and Bid`ah, until the conditions of the Muslims have reached the current weakness and many nations have attacked them. All Muslims should return to their correct faith adhering to its just rules, learning from the original sources of the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic Sunnah, and advising each other accordingly. We must cooperate to achieve this in all fields, whether legislative, economic, political, social or others; and avoid anything that contradicts it or leads to ambiguity. In this manner Muslims will restore their lost dignity and their previous glory, and Allah will make them triumph over their enemies and rule the world</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">كيف يعلم الأب أبناءه التوحيد؟<br />
Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Allama Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How does a father teach his children <em>Tawheed</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ● &#8216;He teaches them <em>Tawheed</em> just like he teaches them other matters of the <em>Deen</em>. From the best of what is in this subject is the book <strong>&#8216;The Three Principles&#8217;</strong> by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahab. If he makes them <strong>memorise</strong> it by heart and <strong>explains </strong>to them its meanings appropriately to their understanding and their intellects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there comes a lot of goodness from this. This is because this book is built upon questions and answers, and clear easy expressions, which have no complexity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the father <strong>shows them the <em>Ayaat</em> of Allaah (His signs)</strong> so that he can practically implement what is mentioned in this small book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example,  the sun, the father asks, who created it? Likewise the moon,  the stars,  the night and day, you say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The sun, who created it? Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moon?   Allaah,  the night?  Allaah, the day?  Allaah.  Allaah -Azza wa Jal- created all of these. This is so that one can water the tree of the <em>Fitrah</em> (the natural disposition) because the human himself has been created with his natural disposition upon <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah -Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Like the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(كل مولود يولد على الفطرة ، فأبواه يهودانه أوينصرانه أو يمجسانه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Every newborn is born upon the <em>Fitrah</em> (natural disposition), so it is his parents who either make him into a Jew or into a Christian or into a Majoos (fire worshipper).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">● Also he <strong>teaches them <em>Wudu</em></strong>, how to make <em>Wudu</em> by demonstration and saying: This is how one does <em>Wudu</em>, and he performs the <em>Wudu</em> in front of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">● Likewise the <strong><em>Salah</em> </strong>(prayer), along with taking aid with Allaah Ta&#8217;ala, and asking Allaah -Azza wa Jal- for guidance for them. Also, that one keeps away from any statement which opposes good behaviour or every prohibited action, so he should not get them used to lying,  cheating and treachery,  nor lowly manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if the father was trialed by prohibited actions, like if he was trialed by smoking,  he should not smoke in front of them because they will get used to it and it will become easy upon them to do it as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> One should know that every man of a household is responsible for the people of the house, due to the saying of Allah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(يَا أَيُّهَاالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">《 <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell)</span>》[Tahreem: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our protecting them from the fire cannot be except if we get them used to righteous actions and to leave off bad actions. The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> affirmed that in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(الرجل راع في أهله ومسؤول عن رعيته)<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;A man is a shepherd for his family and he is responsible for his flock.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A father should know that their being righteous is beneficial to him in this world and the hereafter Indeed from the closest of people to their fathers and mothers are the righteous children, male and female.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(وإذا مات الإنسان انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث: صدقة جارية، أو علم ينتفع به،أو ولد صالح يدعو له )<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;When a person dies his actions cease except for three: continuous charity,  or knowledge people benefit from,  or a righteous child who supplicates for him.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah Ta&#8217;ala to aid all of us upon carrying out the trust and responsibility.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">[Silsilah Noor ala Darb. Tape: 350 side A]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on restoration of monuments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some newspapers have published articles on reviving and paying attention to monuments, written by some authors, including Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Salih Muhammad Jamal. </span>These articles have been responded to by His Eminence, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd. </span>He efficiently and instructively answered to the claims included therein, may Allah reward him. However, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anwar Abul-Jadayil, </span>may Allah guide and inspire him with what is right, was not satisfied with that reply or had not seen it. Therefore, he wrote an article on the subject, published by the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue number 5448, dated 22/4/1402 A.H. In this article, which is entitled &#8220;The Way of the Two Hijrahs&#8221;, he stated: &#8220;This is a review of the word published in the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue 5433, on 7/4/1402 A.H., by Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-Quddus Al-Ansary, </span>as a commentary on the investigation done by the researcher and man of letters, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-`Aziz Al-Rifa`y, </span>of the sites which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed through on his Hijrah (emigration) from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah </span>to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. </span>It urges us to stimulate officials to set signs indicating such posts such as, for example, two tents as close as possible to the two tents of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Um Ma`bad </span>with whatever else is suitable for the rest of posts, after taking the necessary precautions to prevent any transgression that could impart to them the tinge of sanctity or glory, and any deviation from the requirements of Shari`ah (Islamic law). For, the aim is to inform students, researchers and tourists who want to know about this path and these posts, to perceive the difficulties that the Messenger (peace be upon him) went through during this secret and covert trip.This is meant only to give lesson and example and inure people to hardships in Da`wah (calling people to Allah), following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">However, side roads should be built and paved, off the main roads, with rest houses for the tourists, making it easier for people to enter the places where the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed, starting with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Hira&#8217; Cave, </span>then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Thawr, </span>and the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was pursued by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Suraqah ibn Malik, </span>until we reach<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Quba&#8217;. </span>This should also include the preceding sites in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah, </span>such as Dar<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Arqam ibn Abul-Arqam, </span>the pass where he and his family were boycotted, the pathway he assumed during the Conquest of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then the places he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Abtah, </span>and also in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Hunayn, </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Badr. </span>This also applies to sites he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, </span>the battlefields of the conquests, and his places of presence in their rural areas, then his path to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Khaybar </span>and to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This is thus meant to provide people with more information about his unique efforts in spreading the Da`wah, and to teach them to follow the Prophet&#8217;s example in that regard.<strong> [End of quote]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Likewise, Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Faruq Akhdar </span>recommended in his article, published in Al-Jazirah newspaper, issue number 3354, dated 13/1/1402 A.H., the development of archaeological sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Muslims on a continuing basis, to ensure income; as he alleged that petrol reserves would run out. Maintaining his viewpoint, he stated<em> &#8220;that Christian religious tourism in the Vatican is one of the main sources of income in Italian economy. Israel sold empty bottles to the Jews in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> America, </span>under the claim that such bottles were full of holy air from Al Quds.&#8221;</em> He also pointed out that among the benefits this will bring about is that it will<em> &#8220;Engrave knowledge about Islam in the minds of Muslim children&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Due to the <strong>bad effects that reviving religious monuments have on the `Aqidah (creed)</strong>, I wanted to clarify the truth and corroborate the writings of scholars on this issue, cooperate with those scholars in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah), advise people for the Sake of Allah, expose suspicious points, and illustrate supporting evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Hence, I would like to say that taking care of monuments in the way mentioned above <strong>would lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>. This is because people&#8217;s souls are weak and are prone to cling to that which they deems beneficial. Besides, there are many types of Shirk, which are imperceptible for most people. Hence, those who stop at these monuments &#8211; whether they are real or fake monuments &#8211; will realize that ignorant people wipe themselves with the dirt of these places, and with the trees and stones therein. Those ignorant people also pray there and invoke those to whom the sites are attributed, thinking that this is a means of approaching Allah (Exalted be He), attaining Shafa`ah (intercession), and having theirs distresses relieved. Such an ignorance-based approach is maintained by misleading callers whose souls are impregnated with idolatry, and who exploit these monuments to misguide people and encourage them to visit these monuments in order to acquire some financial gains. Regretfully, there is no one at these monuments to inform people that they are meant only for people to derive an example. Rather, the opposite usually takes place. </span><span id="more-243"></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">This is evident to the wise people in some countries that are afflicted with the obsessive attachment to shrines, where people are accustomed to worshipping them besides Allah, and circumambulating them in the same way Muslims circumambulate</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Ka`bah, </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext that people entombed therein are Awliya&#8217; (pious people). So, how far worse would it be if they were told that such monuments are attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), knowing that Satan unremittingly seizes the most suitable times to mislead people, and therefore Allah (Exalted be He) says about him: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 82" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs(Satan)]said:ByYourMight,"></a>[Iblîs (Satan)] said:<em> &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all,</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 83" target="_blank" name="ExceptYourchosenslavesamongst"></a>&#8220;Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221;</span></em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> He (Exalted be He) also says about Satan, the enemy of Allah: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 16" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs)said:BecauseYouhave"></a>(Iblîs) said:<em> &#8220;Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 17" target="_blank" name="ThenIwillcometothemfrombefore"></a>&#8220;<em>Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).</em>&#8220;</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Satan deceived Adam (peace be upon him) and caused him to be driven out of Jannah (Paradise), although Allah (Exalted be He) had warned Adam against Satan, and showed him that Satan was his enemy, as</span><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in Surah (chapter) Ta-ha: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 121" target="_blank" name="Thentheybothateofthetree,"></a><em>Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 122" target="_blank" name="ThenhisLordchosehim,andturned"></a>Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Another example is the <strong>story of</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">with</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Al-Samiry</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">when he molded for them, out of their possessions, a calf to worship instead of Allah. Then, Satan made this act fair-seeming to them, although it was clearly false. It has been authentically reported in Jami` (Hadith Compilation of)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tirmidhy </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others through an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators) from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Abu Waqid Al-Laythy </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="WewentoutwiththeMessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10630" class="tip"></span>We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to Hunayn, when we had just recently left Kufr (disbelief). The Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in worship) had a lote-tree which they would frequent and would hang their swords upon. They called it &#8216;Dhat Anwat&#8217;. When we passed by a lote-tree, we said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have?&#8217; The Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great)! By the One (Allah) in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said what the Children of Israel said to Musa, &#8216;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8217; Certainly, you will follow the ways of those who came before you.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have&#8221; to that of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">who said: &#8220;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8221; This indicates that the meanings and purposes are what count, not merely the words. And due to the gravity of the crime of Shirk and its threats in ruining one&#8217;s work, we find the Khalil (beloved, close elect) of Allah, Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), invoke Allah to safeguard him and his children against Shirk. Allah (Exalted be He) says: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 35" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenIbr%C3%A2h%C3%AEm(Abraham)"></a>And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: &#8220;O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 36" target="_blank" name="OmyLord!Theyhaveindeedled"></a>O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> If the prophets and messengers &#8211; who are the best of creation, the most knowledgeable about Allah, and the most fearful of Him &#8211; were afraid of this, then others are more likely to fall into this trap. Hence, they should be warned of it, and all the means leading to it should be blocked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">No matter how much precautions or reservations the followers of the truth take, this will not protect the ignorant people from the corruptions that result from sanctifying monuments</span>. This is because people differ in terms of their understanding,</span><span style="color:#000000;">vulnerability, and their search for the truth to a great extent, and therefore</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the people of Nuh</span><span style="color:#000000;">(peace be upon him) worshipped Wadd, Suwa`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq and Nasra (these are the names of their idols), although the original purpose of hewing them out was to remind people of the good deeds of those individuals and thus encourage them to emulate these persons, not to idolize or worship them besides Allah. However, Satan misguided those who came after those people who carved such sculptures, and led them to worship these idols instead of Allah. This was the reason of Shirk among the Children of Adam, as was reported by</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bukhari </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be Merciful with him), in his Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Regarding</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings) of Allah&#8217;s saying: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Nuh, 71: 23" target="_blank" name="Andtheyhavesaid:%E2%80%98Youshall"></a>&#8220;<em>And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods: nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwâ‘, nor Yaghûth, nor Ya‘ûq nor Nasr’ (these are the names of their idols)</em>.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Ibn `Abbas was reported to have said that these are names of righteous men from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the <strong>people of Nuh</strong>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">He added that when they perished, Satan inspired their people to set statues in the seats where those righteous men used to sit, and to name the statues after the names of those people. Sure enough, they did it. Then, they were worshipped only after those who had made them perished and knowledge was discarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for examples from the <strong>practices of the Jews and Christians</strong>, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) ordered us to guard against their ways, because it is the path to aberration and loss. It is impermissible to imitate them in their ways since they contradict our Shari`ah. They were also known for their misguidance, following their own whims, distortion of what was revealed to them through their prophets. Due to these reasons and others, we are forbidden to imitate them or to copy their ways. Consequently, the corruption which would result from restoring and reviving monuments are inescapable, and none other than Allah (Exalted be He) can know the extent and types of their evil consequences. Therefore, it is Wajib (obligatory) to prevent the revival of monuments in order to avoid that which could lead to further corruption. It is known that the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him, and may Allah be pleased with them) were the most knowledgeable people regarding the Religion of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the slaves of Allah. However, they did not revive or sanctify these monuments, or even advise others to revive them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Rather, when<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people travel to the tree by which the Companions pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he orderedthat it be rooted out lest people would idolize it and thus stoop to worshipping it besides Allah. The Muslims thanked him for doing so and considered this as one of his commendable acts (may Allah be pleased with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, if reviving these monuments or visiting them were a lawful act, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have done so in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and after the Hijrah (Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) or ordered people to do so, or his Companions would have either done so themselves or recommended others to do it, knowing that it has been previously mentioned that they were the most knowledgeable among people of the Law of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the servants of Allah. It has not been proven that he (peace be upon him) or his Companions visited Hira&#8217; Cave when they were in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">or in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Thawr Cave. </span><span style="color:#000000;">They did not even do so during the `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), the Year of Conquest, or the Farewell Pilgrimage. Besides, they did not go to the place of the two tents of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Um Ma`bad </span><span style="color:#000000;">or the place of the tree of the pledge. Therefore, it became known that visiting these places, and paving the roads which lead to them is a newly-invented practice (in religion), which has no basis in the Law of Allah, and is among the gravest things that lead to major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). Since establishing buildings on graves and using them as Masjids (mosques) is one of the gravest matters that lead to Shirk, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade it, and he cursed the Jews and Christians for making the graves of their prophets places of worship, informing us that anyone who does so is the most evil of creatures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported in Sahih</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muslim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah Al-Bajaly </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Bewareofthosewhoprecededyou"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10699" class="tip"></span>Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as Masjids.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In addition, the perfect Shari`ah has indicated the obligation of blocking all verbal and practical means leading to Shirk, and scholars corroborated this with countless proofs. Among these proofs, the scholar</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in his book [I`lam Al-Muwaqi`in] ninety-nine proofs, all of which prove the obligation of blocking all the means leading to Shirk or to sins. Such proofs include Allah&#8217;s saying:</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 108" target="_blank" name="Andinsultnotthosewhomthey"></a>And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allâh, lest they insult Allâh wrongfully without knowledge.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> And the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="NoSalah(Prayer)istobeoffered"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24568" class="tip"></span>No Salah (Prayer) is to be offered after the Subh (Morning Prayer) until the sun rises, and no Salah is to be offered after `Asr (Afternoon Prayer) until the sun sets.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> This is meant to block the means leading to worship of the sun instead of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is also meant to prevent imitation of those who do such acts. Another mentioned proof is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and cursed those who do so. He (peace be upon him) also forbade the plastering of the graves, venerating them, and taking them as places of worship. Moreover, he forbade facing it in Salah or offering Salah there. Likewise, he (peace be upon him) ordered leveling them (to ground), and forbade that people light lamps on them or travel to them, so that this would not be a pretext to taking them as idols or associating them with Allah in worship. Indeed, this is deemed forbidden for all people, those who idolize them and those who do not mean to do so, in order to block the means leading evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">What is Wajib for the Muslim scholars and governors is to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in this and other matters. They are also obliged to forbid whatever the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade, and to prevent anything which could lead to Shirk, mischief, sin or idolization of the prophets and the Awliya&#8217; in order to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and block the means leading to Shirk. We ask Allah to mend the affairs of Muslims and grant them comprehension of the religion, and to guide Muslim scholars and governors to that which will bring about their prosperity and salvation in this world and the hereafter. We also ask Allah to guide the Muslim to act upon the Law of Allah in all affairs, and to place all Muslims on His Straight Path. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon His Servant and His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions and those who uprightly follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">From the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) <strong><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong>, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh p.37-39 </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">“When Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee<a style="color:#b85b5a;" href="http://us.mg4.mail.yahoo.com/dc/blank.html?bn=397.8&amp;.intl=us&amp;.lang=en-US#sdfootnote1sym" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sdfootnote1anc"></a><sup>1</sup> came to our region, many people were suffering from illnesses; they were bed-ridden and couldn’t get up. And what was this due to? It was due to the Jinn and so on and so forth. They would go out and come across the Jinn at night in trees and upon the roads and so on, and the devils would take over them. This is because they were ignorant. They didn’t have any understanding of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So when he (i.e. Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee) came and spread Tawheed<strong>, </strong>not ruqyah or anything else, may Allah bless you, all of these things came to an end. All of these (possessions and illnesses) came to an end once Tawheed and knowledge spread. When Tawheed and knowledge spread, these things go away and come to an end. And when ignorance becomes widespread, sorcerers, soothsayers, devils and so on increase and cooperate with one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advised him to do as the good doers in the past did, which was to call to Tawheed and wage war against shirk and false superstitions such that the devils left them and they had no need for people to perform ruqyah on them from devils, sorcerers or anyone else….”</p>
<div id="sdfootnote1">
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong>Translator’s Note:</strong>Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee was born in 1315H in Saudi Arabia where he played a great role in reviving the call to Islaam, particularly in its southern regions, making Saamitah the center of his efforts. He studied under such Scholars as Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibtaheem, the former muftee of Saudi Arabia, and produced students of his own such as Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee. He passed away in 1389H, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
