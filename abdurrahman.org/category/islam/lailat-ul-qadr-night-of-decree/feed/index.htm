Chapter 214<br />
The Superiority of Lailat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, We have sent it (this Qur&#8217;an) down in the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree). And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is? The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e., worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e., 83 years and 4 months). Therein descend the angels and the Ruh [Jibril (Gabriel)] by Allah&#8217;s Permission with all Decrees. (All that night), there is peace (and goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.</b></span><b>&#8221; (97:1-5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>We sent it (this Qur&#8217;an) down on a blessed night [(i.e., the Night of Al-Qadr, Surah No:97) in the month of Ramadan, the 9th month of the Islamic calendar]. Verily, We are ever warning [mankind that Our Torment will reach those who disbelieve in Our Oneness of Lordship and in Our Oneness of worship]. Therein (that night) is decreed every matter of ordainments (i.e., the matters of deaths, births, provisions, and calamities for the whole (coming) year as decreed by Allah). As a Command (or this Qur&#8217;an or the Decree of every matter) from Us. Verily, We are ever sending (the Messengers). (As) a Mercy from your Rubb, Verily! He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower</b></span><b>.&#8221; (44:3-6)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1189.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whosoever performs Qiyam during Lailat-ul-Qadr (Night of Decree), with Faith and being hopeful of Allah&#8217;s reward, will have his former sins forgiven</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1190.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Some of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saw Lailat-ul-Qadr (Night of Decree) in their dreams in the last seven nights of Ramadan, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I see that your dreams all agree upon the last seven nights. Whosoever seeks it, let him seek it in the last seven nights</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1191.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to seclude himself (in the mosque) during the last ten nights of Ramadan. He would say, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Search for Lailat-ul-Qadr (Night of Decree) in the last ten nights of Ramadan</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1192.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to observe I`tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and say, &#8220;<span style="color:#800000;">Seek Lailat-ul-Qadr (Night of Decree) in the odd nights out of the last ten nights of Ramadan</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1193.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> When the last ten nights (of Ramadan) would begin, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would keep awake at night (for prayer and devotion), awaken his family and prepare himself to be more diligent in worship</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1194.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to strive more in worship during Ramadan than he strove in any other time of the year; and he would devote himself more (in the worship of Allah) in the last ten nights of Ramadan than he strove in earlier part of the month</span>.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1195.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If I realize Lailat-ul-Qadr (Night of Decree), what should I supplicate in it?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You should supplicate: Allahumma innaka `afuwwun, tuhibbul-`afwa, fa`fu `anni</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah, You are Most Forgiving, and You love forgiveness; so forgive me)</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: al-ibaanah.com<br />
Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night of Al-Qadr occurs in the last ten nights of Ramadaan during an odd night (i.e. 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th). However the scholars differ as to if it is fixed to one of these odd nights every year or if it changes every year to a different odd-numbered night. Below are the sayings of two of our great scholars, Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen and Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee (may Allaah have mercy on both of them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Night of Al-Qadr has a Fixed Date:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best night in Ramadaan is the Night of Al-Qadr, based on the Prophet&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;Whoever performs the night prayer on the Night of Al-Qadr with firm faith and while seeking reward, his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is on the twenty-seventh night of Ramadaan according to the strongest opinion. A majority of the ahaadeeth comply with this, including the hadeeth of Zurr Ibn Hubaysh who said: &#8220;I heard Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab (raa) say when it was said to him that &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) said &#8220;Whoever performs the night prayer (every night) throughout the year will achieve the Night of Al-Qadr.&#8221; He (Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab) said: <b>&#8220;May Allaah have mercy on him, his intention was that the people not (grow lazy) and depend solely (on just one night). By the One of whom there is no deity worthy of worship beside Him, it is indeed in Ramadaan. And by Allaah I know on which night it is. It is on the night that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) commanded us to perform the Night Prayer. It is on the twenty-seventh night. Its sign is that the sun rises on its following morning bright with no rays.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one report this is raised to being a saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Imaam Al-Albaanee in his book <i>Qiyaam Ramadaan</i> (pg. 18-19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Night of Al-Qadr is to be sought:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night of Al-Qadr is in the last ten nights of Ramadaan, based on the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;Search for the Night of Al-Qadr in the last ten nights of Ramadaan.&#8221;</b> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] And it falls in one of the odd nights more likely than on the even nights, based on the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Search for the Night of Al-Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten nights of Ramadaan.&#8221;</b> [Al-Bukhaaree] And it is closer to the last seven nights, based on the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (raa) that: <b>&#8220;Some men from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saw the Night of Al-Qadr in a dream during the last seven nights (of Ramadaan). So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8216;I see that all of your dreams agree that it (the Night of Al-Qadr) is in the last seven nights. So whoever wants to search for it, then let him search for it in the last seven nights.'&#8221;</b> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] And it is also based on the hadeeth in Muslim from Ibn &#8216;Umar (raa) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Look for it in the last ten nights. But if one of you becomes weak or is unable, then do not let the remaining (last) seven nights overcome him.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the odd nights in the last seven nights, it is closest to the twenty-seventh night due to the hadeeth of Ubay Bin Ka&#8217;ab (raa) who said: <b>&#8220;By Allaah, I know which night it is. It is on the night that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) commanded us to perform the Night Prayer. It is on the twenty-seventh night.&#8221;</b> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night of Al-Qadr is not specified to one fixed night throughout all the years. Rather, it constantly changes. So one year it could occur on the twenty-seventh night for example and on another year it could occur on the twenty-fifth night, according to Allaah&#8217;s Will and Wisdom. What directs us to this is the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Look for it (i.e. the Night of Al-Qadr) when there remain nine nights, when there remains seven nights, or when there remains five nights (i.e. 21st, 23rd, and 25th respectively without mention of 27th).&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in <i>Fath-ul-Baaree</i>: &#8220;The most strongest opinion is that it is on an odd night in the last ten nights and that it constantly changes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has hidden knowledge of its occurrence from His servants out of mercy for them so that they can increase their actions in the search for it during these honorable nights, by praying, making <i>dhikr</i> and supplicating. So they grow and increase in the nearness to Allaah and His reward. And He also kept it hidden from them as a test for them to distinguish who amongst them struggles and makes an effort to find it and who is lazy and negligent. This is since whoever constantly strives for something, he will exert himself in his search for it and trouble himself in finding it and achieving it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And perhaps Allaah discloses the time of its occurrence to some of His servants through signs and signals, which one is able to see, just as the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saw its sign that he would be prostrating in mud on its following morning. So it rained on that night and he prayed the (following) morning (Fajr) prayer in mud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author: &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
Source: Ahaadeeth As-Siyaam (pg. 141-143)<br />
Translator: Al-Manhaj.Com Staff</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever performs the night prayer on the night of Al-Qadr with <i>Eemaan</i> (firm belief) and seeking reward will have all his past sins forgiven.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is evidence for the virtue of the night of Al-Qadr as well as performing <i>qiyaam</i> (night prayer) during it. And it indicates that it is a grand night, which Allaah has honored and made better than a thousand months, with regard to its blessing and the blessings found in the righteous deeds that are performed in it. Thus it is better than the worship of a thousand months and that is equivalent to eighty-three years and four months. Due to this, whoever performs <i>qiyaam</i> (night prayer) with true faith and while seeking reward in it, will be forgiven his past sins. There were certain verses revealed concerning this virtue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>&#8220;We sent it (the Qur&#8217;aan) down on a blessed night. Verily We are Ever-Warning. Therein (on that night) is decreed every matter of ordainment.&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is a <b>&#8220;blessed night&#8221;</b> meaning it possesses much good and blessing due to its merit and the great reward that awaits the one who does good deeds in it. Among its blessings, is that Allaah revealed the Qur&#8217;aan in it. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Verily, We have sent it (the Qur&#8217;aan) down in the night of Al-Qadr. And what will make you know what the night of Al-Qadr is? The night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months. Therein descend the angels and the <i>Rooh</i> (Jibreel) by their Lord&#8217;s permission with all decrees. (All that night) there is peace, until the appearance of dawn.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said concerning Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;Therein descend the angels and the <i>Rooh</i>&#8220;</b>: &#8220;This means that the descending of the angels increases during this night due to the vast amount of its blessings. And the angels descend along with the descent of blessing and mercy, just as they descend during the time when the Qur&#8217;aan is recited and encompass the gatherings in which Allaah is remembered and spread their wings for the true seeker of knowledge, out of respect for him.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This night occurs only in Ramadaan, since Allaah revealed the Qur&#8217;aan in it. He informs us that its revelation occurred during the month of Ramadaan in His saying: <b>&#8220;Verily, We have sent it (the Qur&#8217;aan) down in the night of Al-Qadr.&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: <b>&#8220;The month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that its revelation from Allaah to His Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) began in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s statement: <b>&#8220;The night of Al-Qadr&#8221;</b> is either an indicative of the honor and station of that night, as it is said: &#8220;Such and such person has great Qadr&#8221;. The conjunction of <b>&#8220;the night&#8221;</b> to Al-Qadr is the joining of a descriptive feature to it, thus making it mean &#8220;An honorable night&#8221;. The word <b>&#8220;Al-Qadr&#8221;</b> may also be in reference to the ordainment and disposal of affairs. Thus, its being joined to the word <b>&#8220;the night&#8221;</b> would be in order to denote a place or time for it. So it would mean &#8220;the night in which all that will occur in the following year will be decreed.&#8221; This is similar to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;Therein (on that night) is decreed every matter of ordainment.&#8221;</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said of this: &#8220;Therein is decreed every matter for the (upcoming) year&#8221; [8] and Ibn Al-Qayyim said that this is the correct opinion. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What seems most correct is that there is nothing that restricts the possibility of these two understandings and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: <b>&#8220;with <i>Eemaan</i>&#8220;</b> means with firm conviction in what Allaah has prepared for those who stand in prayer during this magnificent night. And <b>&#8220;seeking reward&#8221;</b> means looking for reward and the attainment of recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, this is a grand night, which Allaah has chosen for beginning the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan. So the Muslim must acknowledge its weight in worth, by guarding it and spending it in worship whilst having firm conviction and seeking the reward of Allaah, in order that Allaah may forgive all of his previous sins. This is why the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) warned us about being heedless of this night and being neglectful of spending it in worship, for the Muslim would be prevented from its good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (raa) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Ramadaan has come to you &#8211; a blessed month. Allaah has made it obligatory upon you to fast in it. During this month, the gates of heaven are open, the gates of the Hellfire are closed and the evil devils are chained. To Allaah belongs a night in it, which is better than a thousand months. Whoever is prevented from its good, then he has been deprived.&#8221;</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim should supplicate much on the nights in which the night of Al-Qadr is sought. And he should supplicate with that which the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) instructed &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (raa) with, when she asked him: &#8220;What if I know on which night the night of Al-Qadr occurs, what should I say?&#8221; So he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Say: O Allaah, indeed you are All-Pardoning. You love forgiveness, so forgive me.&#8221;</b> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;It is recommended to supplicate a lot at all times and (to supplicate) more than that during the month of Ramadaan, its last ten days and its odd days. And it is highly recommended to increase ones invoking with this supplication: <b>&#8216;O Allaah, indeed you are All-Pardoning. You love forgiveness, so forgive me.'&#8221;</b> [12]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَـهُ فِى لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(1. Verily, We have sent it down in the Night of Al-Qadr.) (2. And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is) (3. The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) (4. Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) (5. There is peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Virtues of the Night of Al-Qadr(the Decree)</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs that He sent the Qur&#8217;an down during the Night of Al-Qadr, and it is a blessed night about which Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(We sent it down on a blessed night.)</span> (44:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Night of Al-Qadr and it occurs during the month of Ramadan. This is as Allah says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;an.)</span> (2:185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas and others have said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah sent the Qur&#8217;an down all at one time from the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz</em>) to the House of Might (<em>Baytul-`Izzah</em>), which is in the heaven of this world. Then it came down in parts to the Messenger of Allah based upon the incidents that occurred over a period of twenty-three years.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah magnified the status of the Night of Al-Qadr, which He chose for the revelation of the Mighty Qur&#8217;an, by His saying,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ &#8211; لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah &#8220;When Ramadan would come, the Messenger of Allah would say,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ، شَهْرٌ مُبَارَكٌ، افْتَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَيْكُمْ صِيَامَهُ، تُفْتَحُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَتُغْلَقُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَحِيمِ، وَتُغَلُّ فِيهِ الشَّيَاطِينُ، فِيهِ لَيْلَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ، مَنْ حُرِمَ خَيْرَهَا فَقَدْ حُرِم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the month of Ramadan has come to you all. It is a blessed month, which Allah has obligated you all to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are shackled. In it there is a night that is better than one thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its good, then he has truly been deprived.)&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this same Hadith. Aside from the fact that worship during the Night of Al-Qadr is equivalent to worship performed for a period of one thousand months, it is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever stands (in prayer) during the Night of Al-Qadr with faith and expecting reward (from Allah), he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Descent of the Angels and the Decree for Every Good during the Night of Al-Qadr</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, the angels descend in abundance during the Night of Al-Qadr due to its abundant blessings. The angels descend with the descending of blessings and mercy, just as they descend when the Qur&#8217;an is recited, they surround the circles of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and they lower their wings with true respect for the student of knowledge. In reference to Ar-Ruh, it is said that here it means the angel Jibril. Therefore, the wording of the Ayah is a method of adding the name of the distinct object (in this case Jibril) separate from the general group (in this case the angels). Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(with every matter.)</span> Mujahid said, &#8220;Peace concerning every matter.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur said, `Isa bin Yunus told us that Al-A`mash narrated to them that Mujahid said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace)</span> &#8220;It is security in which Shaytan cannot do any evil or any harm.&#8221; Qatadah and others have said, <strong>&#8220;The matters are determined during it, and the times of death and provisions are measured out (i.e., decided) during it.&#8221;</strong> Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein is decreed every matter of decree.)</span> (44:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace until the appearance of dawn.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`id bin Mansur said, &#8220;Hushaym narrated to us on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who narrated that Ash-Sha`bi said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ &#8211; سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(With every matter, there is a peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span> `<strong>The angels giving the greetings of peace during the Night of Al-Qadr to the people in the Masjids until the coming of Fajr (dawn)</strong>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah and Ibn Zayd both said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace.)</span> &#8220;This means all of it is good and there is no evil in it until the coming of Fajr (dawn).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Specifying the Night of Decree and its Signs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is supported by what Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ فِي الْعَشْرِ الْبَوَاقِي، مَنْ قَامَهُنَّ ابْتِغَاءَ حِسْبَتِهِنَّ فَإِنَّ اللهَ يَغْفِرُ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ، وَهِيَ لَيْلَةُ وِتْرٍ: تِسْعٍ أَوْ سَبْعٍ أَوْ خَامِسَةٍ أَوْ ثَالِثَةٍ أَوْ آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(The Night of Al-Qadr occurs during the last ten (nights). Whoever stands for them (in prayer) seeking their reward, then indeed Allah will forgive his previous sins and his latter sins. It is an odd night: the ninth, or the seventh, or the fifth, or the third or the last night (of Ramadan).) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah also said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَمَارَةَ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ أَنَّهَا صَافِيَةٌ بَلْجَةٌ، كَأَنَّ فِيهَا قَمَرًا سَاطِعًا، سَاكِنَةٌ سَاجِيَةٌ، لَا بَرْدَ فِيهَا وَلَا حَرَّ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِكَوْكَبٍ يُرْمَى بِهِ فِيهَا حَتْى يُصْبِحَ، وَإِنَّ أَمَارَتَهَا أَنَّ الشَّمْسَ صَبِيحَتَهَا تَخْرُجُ مُسْتَوِيَةً لَيْسَ لَهَا شُعَاعٌ، مِثْلَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ أَنْ يَخْرُجَ مَعَهَا يَوْمَئِذ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the sign of the Night of Al-Qadr is that it is pure and glowing as if there were a bright, tranquil, calm moon during it. It is not cold, nor is it hot, and no shooting star is permitted until morning. Its sign is that the sun appears on the morning following it smooth having no rays on it, just like the moon on a full moon night. Shaytan is not allowed to come out with it (the sun) on that day.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is good. In its text there is some oddities and in some of its wordings there are things that are objectionable. Abu Dawud mentioned a section in his Sunan that he titled, &#8220;Chapter: Clarification that the Night of Al-Qadr occurs during every Ramadan.&#8221; Then he recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was asked about the Night of Al-Qadr while I was listening and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">هِيَ فِي كُلِّ رَمَضَان</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It occurs during every Ramadan.)&#8221; The men of this chain of narration are all reliable, but Abu Dawud said that Shu`bah and Sufyan both narrated it from Ishaq and they both considered it to be a statement of the Companion (Ibn `Umar, and thus not the statement of the Prophet ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed I`tikaf during the first ten nights of Ramadan and we performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said, `That which you are seeking is in front of you.&#8217; So the Prophet performed I`tikaf during the middle ten days of Ramadan and we also performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said; `That which you are seeking is ahead of you.&#8217; So the Prophet stood up and gave a sermon on the morning of the twentieth of Ramadan and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَانَ اعْتَكَفَ مَعِيَ فَلْيَرْجِعْ فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ، وَإِنِّي أُنْسِيتُهَا، وَإِنَّهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ فِي وِتْرٍ، وَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ كَأَنِّي أَسْجُدُ فِي طِينٍ وَمَاء</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever performed I`tikaf with me, let him come back (for I`tikaf again), for verily I saw the Night of Al-Qadr, and I was caused to forget it, and indeed it is during the last ten (nights). It is during an odd night and I saw myself as if I were prostrating in mud and water.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The roof of the Masjid was made of dried palm-tree leaves and we did not see anything (i.e., clouds) in the sky. But then a patch of wind-driven clouds came and it rained. So the Prophet lead us in prayer until we saw the traces of mud and water on the forehead of the Messenger of Allah , which confirmed his dream.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration it adds that this occurred on the morning of the twenty-first night (meaning the next morning). They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded it in the Two Sahihs. Ash-Shafi`i said, &#8220;This Hadith is the most authentic of what has been reported.&#8221; It has also been said that it is on the twenty-third night due to a Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Unays in Sahih Muslim. It has also been said that it is on the twenty-fifth night due to what Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ فِي تَاسِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي سَابِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي خَامِسَةٍ تَبْقَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in the last ten (nights) of Ramadan. In the ninth it still remains, in the seventh it still remains, in the fifth it still remains.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many have explained this Hadith to refer to the odd nights, and this is the most apparent and most popular explanation. It has also been said that it occurs on the twenty-seventh night because of what Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ubay bin Ka`b that the Messenger of Allah mentioned that it was on the twenty-seventh night. Imam Ahmad recorded from Zirr that he asked Ubayy bin Ka`b, &#8220;O Abu Al-Mundhir! Verily, your brother Ibn Mas`ud says whoever stands for prayer (at night) the entire year, will catch the Night of Al-Qadr.&#8221; He (Ubayy) said, &#8220;May Allah have mercy upon him. Indeed he knows that it is during the month of Ramadan and that it is the twenty-seventh night.&#8221; Then he swore by Allah. Zirr then said, &#8220;How do you know that&#8221; Ubayy replied, &#8220;By a sign or an indication that he (the Prophet ) informed us of. It rises that next day having no rays on it &#8212; meaning the sun.&#8221; Muslim has also recorded it. It has been said that it is the night of the twenty-ninth. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he asked the Messenger of Allah about the Night of Decree and he replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِي رَمَضَانَ فَالْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ، فَإِنَّهَا فِي وِتْرٍ إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ ثَلَاثٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ خَمْسٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ سَبْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ تِسْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ فِي آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in Ramadan in the last ten nights. For verily, it is during the odd nights, the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-fifth, or the twenty-seventh, or the twenty-ninth, or during the last night.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said about the Night of Al-Qadr,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهَا لَيْلَةُ سَابِعَةٍ أَوْ تَاسِعَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، وَإِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تِلْكَ اللَّيْلَةَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ عَدَدِ الْحَصَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, it is during the twenty-seventh or the twenty-ninth night. And verily, the angels who are on the earth during that night are more numerous than the number of pebbles.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith and there is nothing wrong with its chain of narration. At-Tirmidhi recorded from Abu Qilabah that he said, &#8220;<strong>The Night of Al-Qadr moves around (i.e., from year to year) throughout the last ten nights.</strong>&#8221; This view that At-Tirmidhi mentions from Abu Qilabah has also been recorded by Malik, Ath-Thawri, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahuyah, Abu Thawr, Al-Muzani, Abu Bakr bin Khuzaymah and others. It has also been related from Ash-Shafi`i, and Al-Qadi reported it from him, and this is most likely. And Allah knows best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Supplication during the Night of Decree</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended to supplicate often during all times, especially during the month of Ramadan, in the last ten nights, and during the odd nights of it even more so. It is recommended that one say the following supplication a lot: &#8220;O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.&#8221; This is due to what Imam Ahmad recorded from `A&#8217;ishah, that she said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If I find the Night of Al-Qadr what should I say&#8221; He replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُولِي: اللْهُمَّ إِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّي</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#808000;">O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.</span></strong>&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah have all recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak (with a different chain of narration) and he said that it is authentic according to the criteria of the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Laylat Al-Qadr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>

A fatwa from Ibn Taymiyah on Why we should seek Laylatul-Qadr on all of the last ten nights of Ramadan. Translated by Owais al Hashimi hafidhahullaah</p>
<p>Read the PDf @ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RZz-y21qm_WkhZU3BscF93THc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RZz-y21qm_WkhZU3BscF93THc/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>When To Seek Out Laylatul-Qadr (The Night Of Decree)</strong><br />
Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah<br />
Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah- was asked about LaylatulQadr, whilst imprisoned in the mountain citadel (in Cairo) in the year 706 H. So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise is for Allaah. Laylatul-Qadr is in the last ten (nights) of the month of Ramadaan. This is what is authentic from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , that he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>It is within the last ten of Ramadaan</strong>&gt;&gt;, and it is within the odd nights from them [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the odd nights may be counted with reference to what has already passed by, such that it should be sought on the night of the twenty first, the night of the twenty third, the night of the twenty fifth, the night of the twenty seventh, and the night of the twenty ninth; and they may otherwise be counted with reference to what remains, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>On the night when nine remain, on the night when seven remain, on the night when five remain, on the night when three remain</strong>.&gt;&gt; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based upon this, if the month is of thirty days, then that will be one of the even nights. So the twenty second will be (the night) when nine remain, the twenty fourth will be when seven remain; and this is how Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree explained it in the authentic hadeeth; and this is how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) established it in the month. If, however, the month is of twenty nine days, then counting in accordance with what remains will then be just the same as counting in accordance with what has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this being the case, it is befitting that the Believer seeks it out in all of the last ten, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Seek it out in the last ten</strong>.&gt;&gt; [3] And it occurs more frequently in the last seven; and it occurs most frequently on the twenty seventh, just as Ubayy ibn Ka`b used to swear an oath that it was the twenty seventh night. So it was said to him: “How have you come to know that?” So he replied: “On account of the sign which Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us of. He informed us that the sun rises on the morning following it being like a brass dish, having no rays.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sign which Ubayy ibn Ka`b reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is from the most well known signs occurring in hadeeth; and it is related regarding its signs that it is a night that is &#8220;bright, shining&#8221;; and it is calm; it is not very hot, nor very cold. It may occur that Allaah reveals it to some of the people in a dream, or whilst awake, such that he sees its light, or he sees one who says to him: &#8220;This is Laylatul-Qadr&#8221;; or he may open his heart to witnessing such things that make the affair clear to him, and Allaah -the Most High- knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[&#8220;Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa&#8221;: (25/284-286).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2016) and Muslim (no.1167/217) as a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree -radiyallaahu `anhu; and by al-Bukhaaree (no.2017) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim (no.1167/217) contains the addition that the narrator Abun-Nadrah said: &#8220;I said: &#8220;O Aboo Sa`eed! You know better about the numbers than us.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Indeed, we have more right to that than you.&#8221; He said: I said: &#8220;What is the ninth, the seventh, and the fifth?&#8221;He said: “When twenty one have passed, then that follows it is the twenty second:and it is the ninth; and when twenty three have passed, then that which follows it is the seventh; and when twenty five have passed, then that which follows it is the fifth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2021) as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.<br />
[3] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2020) and Muslim (no.1169) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhaa.<br />
[4] Reported by Muslim (no.762).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in her menses in her last ten days of Ramadhaan is still beneficial for her to get up in the last third of the night to make du’a as she cannot make salaah, of course . It is beneficial to make du’a in the third of the night and this is open for the one who is in a state of ritual purity or ritual impurity. So there is nothing wrong with that. And the woman in menses also could recite Qur’an from her memory and could make remembrances. All of that. And we can refer you to the book, <strong>&#8220;Natural Blood of Woman&#8221;</strong> by our Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen. Check this book insha Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"> If a sister on her menses during the last ten nights, is she allowed to do prayer on these nights?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. She can do anything except the prayers and fasting. She can invoke Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’aala). She can invoke Allah with this du’a. She can give charity. She can do all good actions of worship except for praying and fasting. Is this clear insha Allah sister? And by the way, a comment on this answer, for all the sisters: a woman who gets her menses during this time &#8211; this is a matter prescribed by Allah. They should not feel in anyway, saddened at all. Why should they feel sad? Even a little bit, when Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’aala) prescribed this matter upon them? This is a very important matter. They shouldn’t have any kind of objection what so ever. They are not going to be deprived of anything that Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’aala) bestowed of his favors because of this. He is the one who commanded her to refrain from prayers. He is the one who commanded her to refrain from fasting. Mercy upon her. I hope that this is insha Allah, ya’ni, met with good understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a good question:<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Because she cannot do the prayers on these nights due to the menses, doesn’t that mean she misses out on the rewards of praying the night of Qadr?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that, she cannot due to a legal permit. So she does the acts of worship permitted for her. She may recite Qur’an from memory. She may invoke Allah on these nights, anticipating these nights. She may give charity. She does what she is permitted to do. And that is why our Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) mentioned that the matter is not limited to the establishment of prayers. But rather to all of the actions. To all of the worship. So that is the critical difference. Because we know that in some nights Prophet Muhammad (salallahu ‘alaiyhi w<span style="font-size:10pt;">asallam) did not establish the prayers all night</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sisters who have their natural blood on these days, shouldn’t give up.<br />
Do acts of worship that are permitted.<br />
Give charity.<br />
Give good word.<br />
Anticipating the reward from Allah. Making du’a. Making remembrances. Alhamdulillah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <a title="The Night Prayer in Ramadaan – Imaam Al-Albaanee" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/10/01/the-night-prayer-in-ramadaan-imaam-al-albaanee/">The Night Prayer in Ramadhan</a> &#8211; by Shaik Nasiruddin Albanee [PDF]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On Page 16</strong> &amp; <strong>17</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the third night (i.e. the 27 night), [17]he (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) gathered his family,his wives and the people and lead us in the night prayer until we feared that we would miss the falaah (success).&#8221; I said: &#8220;What is the falaah?&#8221; He (Abu Dharr) said: &#8220;The Suhoor (pre-dawn meal)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Foot Notes:<br />
[17]He means by this the 27 night of Ramadaan, which is the Night of Al-Qadar, according to the most correct view, as has been stated previously. This is why on this night the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) gathered his family and wives. So there is proof in this that it is recommended for the women to attend the congregation on this night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Legality of Women performing the Night Prayer in Congregation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is legislated for women to attend the congregational Night Prayer, as has been mentioned in the previous hadeeth of Abu Dharr. In fact, it is permissible to place a specific Imaam for them to lead them in prayer apart from the Imaam who leads the men. This is since it is authentically reported that when `Umar (radyAllaahu `anhu) gathered the people for the Night Prayer, he placed `Ubay bin Ka&#8217;ab to lead the men and Sulaymaan bin Abee Hathma to lead the women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Arfajah ath-Thaqafee reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radyAllaahu `anhu) would order the people to establish the Night Prayer in the month of Ramadaan. And he would place an Imaam for the men and another Imaam for the women. I used to be the Imaam for the women.&#8221; [ 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, this applies only if the masjid is wide and ample enough such that one group will not disturb the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foot Notes:</strong><br />
[21] This hadeeth and the one before it have been reported by Al-Bayhaqee (2/494). The first one of the two was also reported by `Abdur-Razzaaq in Al-Musannaf (4/258/8722). Ibn Nasr also reported both hadeeths in Qiyaam Ramadaan (pg. 93) and then used them as evidence for what we stated (pg. 95)</p>
