<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>33 &#8211; Ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands and rubbing one&#8217;s face after supererogatory Prayer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hand and rubbing one&#8217;s face after offering Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque), optional Prayer and Al-Sunan Al-Rawatib (supererogatory prayer that was stressed and regularly performed by the Prophet)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Raising one&#8217;s hands is one of the ways to have supplications answered. It is reported in a Prophetic Hadith that raising one&#8217;s hands is a way to have supplications answered. So, it is permissible for a Muslim to raise his hands after offering supererogatory prayer or at other times; however, he should not keep doing so, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) would not keep doing so all the time, but he may peace be upon him) sometimes did it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for obligatory prayer</strong>, neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor the Companions did it, but they would sometimes do it <strong>after supererogatory Prayer</strong> according to the religious evidence permitting raising one&#8217;s hands on supplicating to Allah when it is done from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>rubbing one&#8217;s face</strong> after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), nothing has been reported about it in authentic Prophetic Hadiths. However, some weak Hadiths allow it, so the Muslim scholars see that such weak Hadiths support one another and authenticate one another. Thus, there is nothing wrong if a Muslim rubs the face after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), but it is better not to do it, because no authentic Hadith reported this act, i.e. rubbing one&#8217;s face after supplicating.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: </strong>What is the difference between<strong> Ittiba&#8221; </strong>(following one&#8217;s traditions; imitation) and <strong>Al Ibtidah </strong>(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ittiba&#8217; is what we are required to do according to the Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law), i.e. following what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has brought of orders and prohibitions. It is said &#8220;We should follow&#8221; because Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow not any Auliya&#8217;</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, besides Him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh &#8211; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(none has the right to be worshipped but He)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allâh and His Messenger</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, the Prophet who can neither read nor write </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, who believes in Allâh and His Words [(this Qur&#8217;ân), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">Gospel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and also Allâh&#8217;s Word: &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and he was, i.e. &#8216;Isa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jesus)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> son of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow him so that you may be quided.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are ordered to follow the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Qur&#8217;an. Holding on to what has been revealed by Allah in the Qur&#8217;an and what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said or done is Ittiba. It is to follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what he ordered or prohibited. This is Ittiba, which is Wajib <em>(</em>obligatory) in matters which we are obliged to do, and it is Mustahab (desirable) in matters which we are desired to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibtida&#8217;, it is innovation of something in the religion which Allah has not permitted, for example: worship in a way that Allah has not made lawful. This is called Ibtida&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours </strong>(Islam)<strong> that is not part of it will have it rejected</strong></span>.&#8221;) and he also said: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The most evil of matters are those which are newly introduced in religion</span></strong>), and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person was to perform more than five Prayers and said they would perform six Prayers, increasing one Prayer at any time of the day, is a Batil (null/void) and Bid&#8217;ah. It is prohibited to perform or to invite people to perform it with the intention that it is a Fard (obligatory, based on a definitive text). Or if someone said the two Sajdahs (prostrations) are not enough, lets make a third Sajdah in every Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Salah); this is Bid&#8217;ah, which if purposely done, will make the Prayer Batil. Likewise if a person decides to perform a second Ruku&#8217; (bowing) in Prayer, this is Bid&#8217;ah except for the eclipse Prayer. Also if someone says: lets allocate a night for worship and we shall pray ten or twenty Rak ahs on the Thursday or Friday night every week, this is Bid&#8217;ah for it is not something which Allah prescribed, as is the night of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) birthday, or the night of the birth of Fatimah, Al-Husayn, Al Badawy, Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, or &#8216;Umar, it is Bid&#8217;ah and the celebration where they pray, talk, perform Dhikr; this is all Bid&#8217;ah because neither Allah nor the Prophet made it lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Ibtida&#8217; is to innovate a worship which Allah did not prescribe, whether it is a verbal or practical; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has not prescribed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of such Bid&#8217;ah is the construction domes and Masjids (mosques) over the graves. People think that this is a way to get closer to Allah, and it is from the Din (religion). Rather it is Bid&#8217;ah because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade construction over graves, because this could lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Of such Shirk acts are to touch the graves with the intention of getting closer to Allah. This is Bid&#8217;ah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building over the graves or plastering them, because this could lead to Shirk. This is also true for those who invoke the dead say &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) by (the intercession of) the dead of the graves&#8221;, &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) with the honor or sake of the Prophet&#8221;, or &#8220;with the honor or sake of the righteous people&#8221;; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. But if someone says: I invoke You (Allah) with my love for You, or with my belief in Your Messenger or with Your Noble Names; this is acceptable and lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bid&#8217;ah is what people have innovated in the religion and not sanctioned by Allah and His Prophet. Ittiba&#8217; is to follow the approach prescribed by Allah to His servants, and follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>12- Ruling on celebrating birthdays </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q: Some scholars say that celebrating birthdays is not correct. Is this true or not? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, celebrating birthdays is an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion). It is not permissible to celebrate birthdays. It is neither permissible to celebrate the Mawlid (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday) nor the birthday of anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Beware of newly-introduced matters in religion), for every newly-introduced matter is a Bid&#8217;ah and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said in his sermon on Friday: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ama Ba&#8217;d (Now then), the best of speech is the Book of Allah, the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), the most evil of matters are those which are newly introduced in religion), and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).</span></strong>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Celebrating birthdays is a Bid&#8217;ah that neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is sufficient for a Mu&#8217;min (believer) to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and carry on his tradition, and keeping far from Bid&#8217;ahs. Love for the Prophet (peace be upon him) is not in committing Bid&#8217;ahs, but in following his wa<em>y (</em>peace be upon him), abiding by his commands, avoiding his prohibitions, and invoking peace and blessings upon him whenever he is mentioned. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Introducing Bid&#8217;ahs is a means that incurs his anger and the wrath of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). As for denouncing the people of Bid&#8217;ah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: Or have they partners (with Allâh — false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allâh has not ordained?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 3; Page No. 43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law), not to introduce Bid&#8217;ahs. Following the Shari&#8217;ah is sufficient, praise be to Allah. Innovation in religion is a way to evil and trial. All praise is due to Allah, the religion is perfect and no one is permitted to introduce any thing that Allah (Exalted be He) did not prescribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is equally applied to celebrating birthdays and other innovations such as building over the graves and taking them as places of Worship. These are types of Bid&#8217;ahs and a means to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Similarly, plastering graves, building domes, and hanging curtains over them are acts of Bid&#8217;ah and a means that lead to Shirk</strong></span>. It is obligatory on the people of Islam to warn against Bid&#8217;ahs, and keep apart from them so as not to contradict their Prophet (peace be upon him). Thus, they follow the commands that he (peace be upon him) ordered and abstain from the prohibitions that he (peace be upon him) forbade.</p>

<p><strong>Previous Class</strong>:<br /> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/07/allaah-created-us-and-gave-us-provision-and-did-not-leave-us-without-purpose/">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Rather He sent a Messenger to us</strong></span>.<sup>4</sup></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>[4]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>



<p>Since it is the case that we may not carry out worship based upon what we think is good nor upon <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) so-and-so and so-and-so from the people, then therefore Allaah sent to us Messengers to make clear to us how we are to worship him, because acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text) it is not permissible that Allaah be worshipped except with that which He has legislated.</p>



<p>So acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> – restricted to text, to that which the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came with. So the wisdom behind sending the Messengers is that they should make clear to the people how they are to worship their Lord, and for them to forbid them from <em>shirk</em> (association of others along with Allaah) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. This is the duty of the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam. </em>And therefore he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عم لا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>



<p><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>So worship is <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text), and <em>bid‘a</em> (innovations) are rejected, and baseless superstitions and ideas are rejected and blind following is rejected. Acts of worship are not taken except from the <em>sharee‘ah </em>(revealed law) which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu alaihi wa sallaam</em> came with.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Rather He sent to us a Messenger</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam </em>the seal, the last one of the Prophets. He sent him to make clear to us why we were created, and to make clear to us how we are to worship Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and to forbid us from <em>shirk </em>and <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) and from sins. This was the duty of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam, </em>and he clearly conveyed the message and he fulfilled the trust which was given to him, and he gave sincere advice to the nation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam, </em>and he explained fully and made clear, and he left us upon a clear white ground, its night is just the same as its day, no-one deviates away from it except one who is destroyed, and this is just as is in His saying, He the Most High:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I completed your religion for you and perfected my favour upon you and are pleased for you with Islaam as your religion</span>.</strong> [5:3]</p>



<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Its checking has preceded. (Mentioned by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 7350 in the Book of clinging to the Book and the Sunnah Chapter 20. And the <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> is reported by Muslim with a fully connected chain as a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa.</em>)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Point 135-136</strong><br />
<strong> Shaykh Ahmad Najmee | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>135</strong>]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> If you hear a man attacking the narrations (<em>athaar</em>) or rejecting the narrations or desiring some thing other than the narrations then have doubt about his Islam. And do not doubt that he is the person of Desires and Innovator.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>136</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Ruler&#8217;s oppression does not reduce or remove anything that Allaah has made obligatory upon the tongue of his prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). His oppression will be upon himself and your acts of obedience along with him will be complete if Allaah,the Most High,wills. Meaning, the congregational prayer and the <em>jumu&#8217;ah</em> prayer along with them and fighting <em>jihaad</em> along with them. And all acts of obedience accompany them in that , for you will have your intention.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 84 : Point 150C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd saw his son come away from the company of a person of the innovated sects, so he said &#8220;<em>O my son! where have you just come from?&#8221;</em> He replied &#8220;<em>from being with Amr ibn Ubayd</em>&#8220;. He said &#8220;<em>O my son! that I should see you coming out from the house of a Khunsaa (hermaphrodite, bisexual) would be more beloved to me than that I should see you coming out from the house of so-and-so.That you should meet Allaah, O my son, as a fornicator , a major sinner, a thief and a treacherous person would be more beloved to me than that you meet Him with the saying of the people of the deviant sects.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do you not see that the Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd knew that the hermaphrodite would not misguide his son away from his religion whereas the innovator may lead him astray until he becomes a disbeliever.</strong></span></p>

Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 64 : Point 110</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">Know that the roots of innovations (</b><em style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">Al-Bid&#8217;ah</em><b style="color:#993300;">) are four. From these seventy-two innovated sects branch off, each one of these have offshoots until they amount to two thousand eight hundred. All of them are misguidance. And all of them will be in the Fire except for one, which is those who believe in what is contained in this book, and who holds it as his creed, without having any </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>uncertainty</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> in his heart or any doubts. He will be a person of the Sunnah and he is the one who will be saved, if Allah wills </b></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] That is, whatever the book comprises of, from the sayings of Allah, the words of His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) and that which the Companions were united upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 63 : Point 108</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Know that the ancient religion is how it was from the death of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) until the murder of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>). His murder was the start of splitting and the start of disagreements. So the Ummah fought amongst itself, split, followed greed and desires and inclined towards this world. There is no permit for anyone to do anything which has been introduced, which the Companions of Allah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahualaihi wa sallam</em>) were not upon, nor for any man to call to anything innovated before him by people of innovation; he would then be just like the one who innovated it. So anyone who claims that, or speaks according to it, has rejected the Sunnah, opposed the truth and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> and has made innovation lawful. He is more harmful to the Ummah than Iblees</span> [1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Al-Laalikaa’ee reports in <em>as-Sunnah</em> (no.238) that Sufyaan ath-Thawree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees than sin. A sin may be repented from, but innovation is not repented from.”</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>..So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu so and so then the times changed.

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the affair remained in order until the Khilaafah of Banu (tribe) of so and so. Then the times changed greatly and innovations became widespread,” </strong></span>Differing increased and <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations; discord) increased after the excellent generations had passed away until there came the time of the `<em>Abbaasiyyeen</em>; the `Abbaasid Khaleefahs and Al-Ma`moon al-`Abbaasee appeared amongst them.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> And he was followed by Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and by Al-Waathiq and they adopted the saying of the <strong><em>Jahmiyyah</em></strong>; this deviant sect and they wanted to force the people of the Sunnah upon the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And they killed some of the <em>Imaams</em> and they lashed others from them. However, the truth remains firm and all praise is for Allaah; it does not depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the callers to other than the way of the truth and of the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> became many.&#8221; </strong></span>Many people today say that they are <em>du</em>`<em>aat</em> (callers) and that they are <em>Jama`aat</em> (groups) and there are sects beneath this cover of <em>da`wah</em> (calling); being <em>du`aat</em> (callers) and what they want is to call the people to misguidance except for those whom Allaah has mercy upon from those who remain upon the call to the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology; way of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his call. Then this one is upon truth and this is the call of truth. Not everyone who carries the name of giving <em>da`wah</em> will be correct until his methodology (<em>manhaj)</em> is looked into, the methodology, which he precedes upon. So if he precedes upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, then he is a caller to truth. And if he is contrary to that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was upon in the methodology of <em>da`wah</em> then he is upon <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (falsehood). So a person should not be deceived by someone saying that he is from the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) for indeed there are <em>du`aat</em> (callers) who are at the gates of the Hellfire and whoever obeys them, they will throw him into it just as he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> And therefore, the author said, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“</strong><strong>and there became many callers to other than the way of truth and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>.” </strong></span>Just as is the case now. There are many who claim that they are calling to Islaam underneath this cover. So if their <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) is looked into and their activities then they are found to be in total opposition to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And trials came about with regard to everything, which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> had not spoken about nor anyone from his companions </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em></strong><strong> (may Allaah be pleased with them). </strong></span>Speech became plentiful and differing and rumour mongering and claims of knowledge. However, all of this will fade into insignificance and what is indicated by the Book and the Sunnah will remain and it is the sound methodology and the straight path. However, this requires two matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>Al-`ilmu-Naafi’</em>: Beneficial Knowledge; <em>`ilm</em> by which that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions and those who followed them upon good were upon.</li>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> <em>As-<u>S</u>abaru Wath-Thabaat</em>: Patience and firmness and that you do not move away; depart along with the discord; trials and tribulations or along with the callers to misguidance. Rather, that you should be <em>thaabit</em> (firm) and be patient upon whatever strikes you from rebukes and blame or threats. As long as you are upon the truth then be patient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>وَاصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا أَصَابَكَ ۖ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And have patience upon whatever befalls you. Indeed that is from those affairs which Allaah has firmly commanded. </strong></span>(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 10</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart, even if the person happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363815261&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters, al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), debating and disputing which occurred between all of the sects, these are newly introduced matters. And the reason for them is the following of desires. And whoever is such that his desires follow that which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came with, then he will not have doubt.; and he will not be a person of disputing nor arguing nor quarrelling, because he is one who submits and complies. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if Guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance, then there will be no fear upon them and they will not grieve.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever follows My Guidance, then he will not go astray and he will not be wretched.</strong></span> (Soorah Taa Haa (20), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is a question of following, <em><strong>ittibaa</strong></em>`, and complying, <em><strong>inqiyaad</strong></em>, and submitting, <em><strong>tasleem</strong></em>, to the command of Allaah and His Messenger without debating and without argumentation. And the people of misguidance did not fall into argumentation and debates except on account of the fact that they did not submit to Allaah and to His Messenger in the way that the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah submitted. And therefore you will find the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and all Praise is for Allaah, united with no difference between them in the matter of `aqeedah, creed and belief; rather disagreement is found with the misguided sects. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they turn away then they are the ones who will have split away and opposed. So Allaah will suffice you against them. And He is the all Hearing the all Knowing.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 137)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the confirmation of this occurs in another aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow the other paths for they will cause you to split away and separate from His path. This He has commanded you with so that you may be dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-An `aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“(Theological rhetoric, arguing, debating, disputing are all newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart)</strong> <strong>even if the person involved in them happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah</strong>.” Meaning, he will still be in error, because he has attained these two (the Truth and Sunnah) through other than the correct path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the correct path is submission and not delving and debating and arguing which just causes the hearts to become bitter and produces grudges. And it also brings about something worse than that which is at-takfeer, people declaring others to be disbelievers, because the misguided sects they declare each other to be disbelievers and they declare each other to be misguided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every sect rejoicing at what they themselves are upon.</strong> </span>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone thinking that what he is upon is what is correct. As for the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the people of Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth, who submitted to the command and complied, then disagreements did not occur between them, and all Praise is for Allaah. And they do not declare each other to be disbelievers, and they do not declare each other to be misguided; rather they praise each other. And some of them follow others, because they are upon a correct path. Indeed hatred and grudges and declarations of others being disbelievers and being misguided only comes about on account of contradicting the Truth and taking hold of opinions and ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that everyone wants to defend his own opinion. So he will not accept that it will be said to him, “You are wrong,” for this will mean that you are accusing his intellect of being deficient and he will not be pleased with this. However, if you say to a person of Truth when he has made a mistake, “You have erred with regard to the evidence in this matter, you have missed out on the Sunnah,” then he will accept it, because his intent is the Truth and his intent is not just to support his own opinion. So if you say, “O so and so, you have missed out on the Sunnah, you have missed out on the correct evidence,” then he will accept and return. But if you say to a person who is a follower of desires, “You are in error,” then he will become angry and become worse. And this is the sign of the people of desires, that everyone just wants to aid and support that which he desires. But as for the person of the Truth, then what he wants is that the Truth should be aided, and he seeks after the Truth. And the wise word is the lost property of the believer; wherever he finds it, he takes hold of it. [01]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 12 : Point 08</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that a person’s Islaam will not be complete until he is one who follows, one who attests and one who submits </span></strong><span style="color:#993300;">(to the Book and the Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">. So whoever claims that there remains anything from Islaam not sufficiently explained by the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has lied against them. And this is sufficient for a person as a separation from them, and as an attack upon them. So he is an innovator, astray, leading others astray, introducing into Islaam that which is not from it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363464639&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-companions-didnt-sufficiently-explain-islam-then-he-has-lied-against-them" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a completion of the previous speech. So his saying, <strong>“A person’s Islaam will not be complete until he is one who is a follower </strong>(of the Book and the Sunnah)<strong>, one who attests to it, one who submits to it.”</strong> He is one who follows, not one who innovates. He should be one who believes and attests to the Truth, not one who has doubts and is uncertain. <strong>“One who submits”</strong> meaning one who submits to the Book and the Sunnah, because these matters require submission. They are not matters were argumentation is acceptable. So we submit to Allaah and to his Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we do not argue about this matter, or we do not give our own opinion, as they say, along with the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever claims that anything remains from the affair of Islaam which the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam have not sufficed us with regard to</strong> (not sufficiently explained to us) <strong>then he has lied against them.”</strong> Meaning whoever claims that the Companions fell short in clearly explaining and in clarifying and in conveying it to the people from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and claims that he has scope to speak or to add something, then he intends evil for the people. Because the Companions<em> radiyAllaahu`anhum</em> did not leave anything from that which they heard from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or anything which they saw from him except that they conveyed it to the nation faithfully; and they made it clear to the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore for this reason the <em>tafseer</em> (explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan) of the Companions is given precedence over the <em>tafseer</em> of anyone after them. Because they were the students of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they heard the Qur&#8217;aan from him <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they heard the <em>ahaadeeth</em> (his sayings) from him and they heard the explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan from him, and they saw his <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> actions and they conveyed that faithfully. So they did not leave out anything at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims that they fell short and left something out that they did not convey then he is a liar and an inventor of falsehood. He is astray/misguided, leading others astray, trying to cause the people to have doubts of the Religion of Allaah and about its carriers from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger, <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he is acting treacherously towards the Companions, as is the way with the people of innovation. They betray the Companions and make false accusations against them in order to remove the intermediary link between us and between Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is obligatory to beware of those people and that we should know the true worth of the Companions and their status <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where did this Qur&#8217;aan come to us from? And these <em>ahaadeeth</em> (sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) and this <em>fiqh</em> (knowledge of the Religion). It did not come except through them taking it and carrying it from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are the ones who carried it to us and they narrated it to us completely, each one in accordance with the amount which Allaah gifted him with and each one in accordance with his own ability. They did not leave anything from the Religion of Allaah except that they conveyed it just as they took it from Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they are fully trustworthy because Allaah chose them to be Companions of His Prophet and to take from him and to narrate from him. Allaah chose them for that, and then people come along and accuse them of falling short or accuse them of having deficiency. No one says this except one who is astray, trying to lead other people astray. He wants to cut off the link of this nation with the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and therefore to cut off their link with Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu <em>`alayhi wa sallam</em>. We were not present at the gatherings of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we didn’t hear him; and between us and him there are many centuries. So the honourable Companions <em>radiyAllaahu`anhum</em>, they are the ones who conveyed to us from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So the status of the Companions in the Religion is a tremendous status and they cannot be accused of having concealed anything or having hidden anything, and of not bringing it out openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Then he is an innovator. He is astray, leading others astray, introducing into Islaam that which is not from it.”</strong> This is his intent, to introduce into Islaam that which is not from it, and he will not be able to do this unless he makes attacks upon the Companions and he betrays them and lies against them. Then he will be able to bring things from himself and say, “This is the religion which it is obligatory for us to proceed upon.” This is their goal in lying against the Companions and in betraying them and in belittling them. So that they can take the opportunity to establish for the people a religion from themselves, and in accordance with their intellects and their opinions; and so that we should take from shaykhs of misguidance and imaams of misguidance; those who change the Sunnah of the Messenger, <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> by lying/falsehood and who falsely bring about shaykhs and chains [01] from themselves in contradiction to sources of Islaam. This is something which is clear, which is present in what they pass on and in their thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, and all praise is for Allaah, any misguidance which may persist with them is surrounded and restricted and is exposed by the light of the truth and the light of revelation. These expose the many lies which they are guilty of and which are written in their books. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Editor’s note: meaning chains of narration</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Translator’s side point: Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee <em>hafizahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is related from Imaam Maalik, <em>rahimahullaah ta`aalaa</em>, that he used to say, <strong>‘Whoever introduces an innovation into the Religion, thinking that it is something good, then he has claimed that Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> betrayed his duty to convey the Message</strong>, because Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you, and perfected My favour upon you, and am pleased with Islaam as your Religion.’ </strong></span>(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh as-Suhaymee said, “Refer for the references of this report to al-I`tisaam of ash-Shaatibee, alBida` of Ibn Waddaah, Sharh Usool `Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah of al-Laalikaa·ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee <em>rahimahullaah</em> that he said, <strong>‘Whoever sanctions an action as being something good then he has legislated (brought about Islaamic legislation).’</strong> Meaning: whoever holds something to be good from himself, and introduces it into the Religion as an innovation, then he has set himself up as one who can legislate besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Maalik rahimahullaah also said  when a man came to him and said, ‘O Aboo `Abdillaah! <strong>Where should I enter the state of ihraam from?’</strong> (the state which you enter when you want to perform `Umrah or Hajj) So he replied, ‘You enter the state of ihraam from Thul-Hulayfah, from the place where Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> entered the state of ihraam.’ (Imaam Maalik was the Imaam of Madeenah, and the man who was asking him in the city of Madeenah) So then the man said, ‘But I want to enter the state of ihraam from Madeenah itself, from the vicinity of the grave.’ So Imaam Maalik said, ‘But I fear for you fitnah (evil, tribulation).’ The man said, ‘And what fitnah can there be? <strong>It’s just some miles which I’m adding.’</strong> So Imaam Maalik said, ‘I fear for you fitnah, because Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So let those who contradict the command of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam beware, lest a fitnah (trial/tribulation) befall them or a painful punishment.’</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Noor (24), aayah 63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh as-Suhaymee said, “So the affair is dangerous; that a person introduces innovation into the Religion. He is dangerous, and introduces that which is not from it. The affair is at the limit of danger.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 11 : Point 07</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that departing from the correct path occurs in one of two ways. As for one of them, then it is that a man strays from the correct path, intending nothing but good. So he is not to be followed upon his error, because he is heading towards destruction. And (secondly) a man who deliberately opposes the Truth and acts contrary to the pious ones who came before him, then he is astray, leading others astray. He is a rebellious devil within this nation. It is a duty upon those who are aware of him to warn the people against him and to explain his condition to them so that no one falls into his innovation and is destroyed.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-departing-from-the-correct-path-occurs-in-one-of-two-ways" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh rahimahullaah having explained in the preceding speech the correct path which it is obligatory upon the Muslim to proceed upon in his `aqeedah (creed and belief and his Religion. He then mentioned that one who departs from this path will be one two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first man:</strong> is one who departs from it, not doing so deliberately, rather intending good. However he follows a path other than the path of good. And personal deduction will not be sufficient, even if the person’s intention was righteous and his intent was good, but along with that he must be upon the correct path. This person is counted as being one who has erred. Whoever agrees with him upon that and proceeds with him upon error, and he knows that it is error, then he is destroyed, because this is a path leading to destruction. Even though the person (original person), did not intend to depart from it, rather he was only seeking after good. And this is the condition of many of those people who introduce new ideas from themselves in the matter of knowledge of `aqeedah (creed and belief). So this is a matter which is not permissible and they are not to be followed upon it and the person is not upon correctness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Majestic and Most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my Straight Path so follow it, and do not follow the divergent paths which will separate you away from His path (Allaah’s path)</span></strong> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever path will take us away from the Straight Path, then we reject it. Even if the person upon it is intending good and his intention is good, then still we do not following him upon that. And he, if he continues upon his error, he will go on to destruction, because whoever leaves the correct path on his journey and takes a path leading to ruin, then he will be destroyed. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for the second man:</strong> then he is the one who exits deliberately. He is aware of the Truth. And he knows that what he is gone out to is baatil (false and futile). However, he deliberately exits from the Truth with the intent of misleading the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first person, his intention was to rectify the people. However he did not proceed upon the correct path. Whereas the second person, his intention is to misguide the people and to turn them away from the correct path. So this one is a shaytaan (a devil), because the devils take the people away from the Straight Path. Iblees said to his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I shall lie in wait for them and lead them astray from Your Straight Path&#8221;</span></strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He meant that he would turn them away from it, towards the deviant paths. And the Prophet, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, struck an example for this, when he drew a straight line and he drew around it other lines. He said with regard to the straight path,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This is the path of Allaah,”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said with regard to the other paths,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“and these are the other paths, upon every path from them there is a devil calling the people to it.”</strong></span> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clear illustration, and what the Shaykh (Imaam Al-Barbahaaree) mentioned here is consistent with it. Since the person who takes the people from the Straight Path, taking them to new and innovated paths, does not want good for them. Rather he wants for them destruction and he is a devil. Whether he be from the devils of the jinn or from the devils of mankind. So it is upon us to beware of this even more than we are wary of the first one, because this one deliberately tries to misguide the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So he is astray, leading others astray. He is a rebellious devil.”</strong> He is misguided himself, misguiding other people and he is a rebellious, defiant devil. He wants the people turn away from the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is a duty upon whoever knows of him that he should warn the people against him and make clear his condition to the people so that no one falls into his innovation and is destroyed.”</strong> This person who has departed from the Truth deliberately, it is not permissible to remain silent about him. Rather it is obligatory to disclose his affair and to expose his shameful state, so that the people can beware of him. It should not be said, “The people are free to have their own opinions,” “The people should have freedom of speech,” or “There should be respect for the opinions of others,” as they constantly say these days, with regard to respecting the other person’s opinion. So the matter is not a matter of opinions, the matter is a question of ittibaa` (following the Truth). So for us, Allaah has laid down and described a clear path and He has told us to proceed upon it when He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And this is my straight path, so follow it.&#8221;</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever person comes to us and wants us to depart from this path then, firstly, we reject his saying, and secondly, we make his affair clear and we warn the people against him. And it is not allowable to remain silent about him, because if we remain silent about him, then the people will be fooled by him. Especially if he is a person of eloquence, one who can speak and write well, and a person of culture, then the people will be fooled by him. They will say, “This is a qualified person” “This person is from the thinkers,” as occurs at present. So the matter is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this shows that it is obligatory to refute the one who opposes. Opposite to those people who say, “Leave off refutations,” “Leave the people,” “Let everyone have his own opinion and have his own respect and have freedom of thought and the freedom to speak.” In this way this nation will be destroyed. The Salaf (Predecessors), were not silent about the like of those people. Rather they exposed them and refuted them, because they knew of their danger to this nation. So we have no scope for remaining silent about their evil. Rather we must make clear that which Allaah send down. Otherwise we will be people hiding the Truth from those whom about Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who conceal that which Allaah sent down from the clear signs and the guidance after we have made it clear to the people in the Book; those people Allaah curses them and those who curse, curse them</span></strong>. (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affair is not restricted to the mubtadi’ (innovator). Rather the matter involves those who remain silent about him, because blame and punishment include him as well, because what is obligatory is to clarify and clearly explain to the people. This is the role of the knowledge based refutations (rudood), which are to be found plentifully in Islaamic book shops today. All of them defending the Straight Path and warning against those people. So no one promotes these ideas, the idea of the freedom to hold any opinion, or the freedom of speech and respecting others, except for one who strives to misguide and who conceals the Truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we, our intention is the Truth. We do not intend just to defame the people or to just speak against the people. The intent is to make the Truth clear. This is an amaanah (trust and responsibility) which Allaah has placed upon the scholars. So it is not permissible to remain silent about the like of those people. However, unfortunately, when a scholar comes and refutes the like of those people, then they say, “He is just one who is speaking in haste,” to the rest of the evil whisperings. So such a person should not betray the People of Knowledge for their clarifying the evil of the callers to misguidance to the people. He should not betray and let them down. [03] [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan and Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahumAllaah:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">leaving the correct path occurs in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The first is one who leaves the correct path but only intends good
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He did not seek knowledge from the correct place and is heading for destruction</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Following him in his error knowingly is a path leading to destruction</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised privately (if he is not calling to his error)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The second one leaves the correct path deliberately, obstinately and knowing the Truth
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He wishes to mislead the people and he is a devil</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The devil misleads people from the Straight Path (aayah and hadeeth mentioned as proof)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to warn against this person otherwise he will fool the people</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This is the role of the knowledge-based refutations, rudood</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Clarifying the Truth is a trust and responsibility Allaah placed upon the scholars</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Remaining silent about those who mislead the people is hiding the Truth</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regard to the wording, “ Innahu Haalaka” this person who intended good but strayed away from the true path, strayed into innovation, then literally ‘he is destroyed’, Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “I say, if the author rahimahullaah, had restricted this wording and the judgement concerning it, such that he had said, ‘he is destroyed, if he dies upon it and does not repent’ (it would be better). And I say also, that intending good will not benefit a person, that he just intends what is good, but he does not adhere to the Straight Path which came from Allaah and from His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.” Then the Shaykh, mentioned the long incident of those people who were counting the stones in the masjid (reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan) the narration concerning `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh. When they were criticized by `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh, that they made their excuse and they said, “<strong>By Allaah, O Aboo `Abdur-Rahmaan, we only intended good</strong>.” Ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh, responded to them, “<strong>And how many people intend good, but do not attain it</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by at-Tayaalisee in his Musnad, Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, Sa`eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan, ad-Daarimee, an-Nasaa·ee in (Sunan) al-Kubraa and a number of other references besides. All of them say as a narration of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood. It was declared authentic by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim, agreed to by ath-Thahabee and declared saheeh (authentic) by others from the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In addition Shaykh al-Albaanee, in his checking of al-Mishkaat, declared this narration to have a hasan (good) chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translators side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “What is obligatory upon everyone who is aware of the Truth is that he should aid it.” After some speech he said, “And whoever claims that refuting the people of innovation causes splits in this nation and it disunites this nation, then he is misguided also, because he wants this nation to unite upon falsehood. This is a matter which Islaam does not consent to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translators side point:</strong> From the taped explanation of Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah. With regard to this point that the people who depart from the Truth are one of two people, he said, “Yes, this is a precise categorisation from the Shaykh, rahimahullaah. The innovators are indeed of two categories, because the Shaykh, as you know, throughout his whole book, his focus is upon the innovators. And from them there is a category who actually want the Truth, but he does not attain it. Just like the people of thikr who we mentioned a short while ago (the same incident of those people in the masjid who were doing an innovated form of thikr which `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood criticised). Those who said to Ibn Mas`ood, radiyAllaahu’anh, ‘We only intend the Truth.’ However, how many people there are who intend the Truth, but do not attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever intends the Truth, he should seek it from its correct place. And the Truth does not come about through venerating individuals, nor through flashy words, nor by having a majority. It only comes about through ittibaa`, following the Truth, following the first generations, the generations of the Companions and the Taabi`een and proceeding upon their methodology. So the like of this person (the first person, he strays into innovation but he only intends the Truth) is destroyed if he does not come back and seek the Truth with its proof from the correct place. However his danger is less than the danger of the second category of the people. And perhaps his harm will be restricted to himself, meaning the one who intends the Truth but he seeks it not in the correct way. So he slips and innovates and falls into innovation, and the judgement upon him will be in the light of how severe his innovations are. It may be of the level of something less or it may be something major or it may be something which takes him out of Islaam, but his danger will be less. And your advising him should be between you and him, if you know that he is not a caller to innovation and that he does not propagate innovation. Then you should come to him privately and you make clear to him the correct path, so that he can follow it. You make clear to him the methodology of the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah. You don’t make his affair open. You don’t mention him upon the minbars. You don’t mention him as being a person with criticism. Rather you direct him and give him sincere advice. So if this type of person is how he is, then maybe be one day, by the permission of Allaah, he will turn back. And even if he stays upon his innovation, then he does not represent a great danger to the people (he doesn’t call to this innovation). However what is obligatory is that you strive to give him advice and clarify and give him correct, constructive direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the second category of people, those who are obstinate, those who do so deliberately with pride, they commit innovation, obstinately, deliberately. The more you forbid him, the more he increases in his error until he becomes a caller to innovation. Therefore the Salaf used to reject the narrations of an innovator, who was a caller to innovation and not accept them, rather they would reject them and warn against him and against his innovation. So the like of this person, you must make his affair clear and warn against him. And if he has written a book, he is refuted with a book. If he has a tape, he is refuted with a tape. If he gives speeches, he is refuted in speeches. The people are warned against his evil. ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh went on to mention further examples in that regard: this is not backbiting; this is correct; this is one of the examples that Imaam An-Nawawee in his book Riyaadus-Saaliheen mentioned are an exception. This is a case where it is obligatory to speak against that person and it cannot be said, “This is backbiting, this is forbidden.” This is not the case. Then after some speech the Shaykh said finishing, “So this second type, who is indicated by the author here, he is the most dangerous of people for this nation. Therefore it is obligatory to warn the people against him and to draw attention to their evil and to warn the nation against their evil. ”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And beware of small matters that have been newly introduced, because small innovations grow, until they become large. This is what happened with every innovation introduced into this nation. Initially it was something small, having resemblance to the Truth; so those who entered into it were misled by this. Then they were unable to depart from it; so it grew large and it became the religion which they followed. So the person diverged from the Straight Path and exited from Islaam.”</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/small-innovations-grow-until-they-become-large" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And beware of small matters that have been newly introduced.”</strong> He says do not be lax about anything from innovation or bid`ah, even if it is something small because it will grow and other things will become added to it, and this is one of the evil results of innovations. Since if the door to innovations is opened they will increase; so do not be negligent and lax about them. And it said (some people say), “This is a small innovation &#8211; it will not harm.” Innovation is actually like a burning piece of coal, even if it is small, then the fire will grow until it burns down the whole house, or the shop, or indeed the whole town.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And most fires come about on account of sparks which are thought little of”</strong> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one should not be careless about them, rather totally close the door to innovation altogether. And the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Beware of newly introduced affairs.</strong></span>” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This word) iyyaakum “beware” is an unrestricted warning against newly introduced innovations, whether they be small newly introduced affairs or large newly introduced affairs. The Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not make any exception with regard to innovations. So his prohibition is general, referring to all innovations. And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And the worst of affairs are the newly introduced matters”</strong></span> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And likewise every innovation that was introduced into this nation, it was something small initially having resemblance to the Truth so those who entered into it were fooled by that, then he (that person) was not able to depart from it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Troubles, trials and tribulations, when they first occurred in this nation, they occurred on account on being lax with the people who cause corruption, until they spread corruption upon the earth. And they brainwashed the youth and the common people and they filled it (the earth) with evil to the extent that great tribulations occurred in Islaam and between the Muslims as is well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was on account of overlooking the people of evil and leaving them alone, until the affair became very serious. So therefore firm resolve must be shown and the door to this affair must be blocked. <span style="color:#ff0000;">And nothing will safeguard against innovations, after Allaah the Majestic and Most High, except for beneficial knowledge. As for the person who does not have knowledge then he will be swept away with the innovations, and he will think that they are something fine because he does not understand innovations</span>. So nothing will save a person from innovations except for that which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam commanded with in his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Orthodox Khulafaa (caliphs).”</span></strong> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what will safeguard from innovations, and this requires learning and acquiring knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah. And therefore the Salaf, the Predecessors, were the people who had the greatest knowledge and understanding of the Religion from this nation, and they took the greatest precaution against innovations, and they were foremost in warning against innovations, because of the fact that they knew what they (innovations) lead to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trials and tribulations when they start to blaze, then they come upon whatever is fresh and dry [05]. They affect the old person and the young person; they come upon the scholars and others besides them; they come upon the whole of the people and they (the people) are not able to escape from them. And if they do manage to escape from them, then their families and their children do not escape from them and those who are round about them. So they are like the fire when it blazes upon the dry stalks of firewood, it is difficult to extinguish. However stopping them as soon as they begin is easy, but as for stopping them after they have grown large and become serious then that is difficult. So therefore it is obligatory to have firm resolve with regard to them, and not to be lax about them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Salaf in the Most Excellent Generations, they used to block innovations and they would not permit anything from them. So the Most Excellent Generations were the purest generations of this nation. And therefore Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam praised them in his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“The best of you is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.”</span></strong> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because they had not used to be lax with innovations, rather they used to blockade them, and their people (people of innovation) used to have to hide themselves away, because of the strength of the people of the Truth. So then when the Most Excellent Generations passed away, then innovations and their people and evils became active. And trials and tribulations were set ablaze amongst the Muslims. However, Allaah the Majestic and Most High guaranteed that this Religion would be preserved. So the Religion is safeguarded and all praise is for Allaah. However destruction occurs for the people of this Religion, they are the ones who may be destroyed. As for the Religion then it is preserved, by Allaah the Mighty and Majestic’s preserving it. And Allaah brings for it those who aid it and establish it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you people turn away then Allaah will exchange another people in your place. Then they will not be the like of you.</strong></span> (Soorah Muhammad (47) aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then Allaah will soon bring a people whom He loves and who love Him</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will not let His Religion become lost, however we are the people who may become lost, if we lose our Religion, and if we give assistance to the people of innovation and to the people who newly introduce affairs and we become lax with them. Then if that happens then we will become lost and perhaps trials and tribulations and fighting and the shedding of blood will occur on account of that, and we will not be able to free ourselves from that. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“until it became large and it became the religion which the person followed”</strong> &#8211; meaning that innovations if they are left then they become the religion later on. And his saying has already preceded, “The people never introduce an innovation except that its like is taken away from the Sunnah.” Until the innovations they become the religion (of those people), and the sunnahs are taken away and innovations become the religion with this society. And that does not mean the whole nation is like that; rather just the society which permits innovations to spread, then they becomes its religion. However that does not mean that the Religion altogether will pass away, rather there will be some other people in a different region or a different city who stand, whom Allaah brings for this Religion, those who will aid it and defend it and guard it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the hadeeth that at the end of time the sunnahs will be taken to be innovations and innovations will be taken to be sunnahs to such an extent that if they are corrected it is said, “You have changed the Religion,” and if they are criticized, then people will say to you, “You are criticizing the Religion”! [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So the person diverged from the Straight Path and exited from Islaam.”</strong> &#8211; meaning that the person of innovation, the affair overtakes him to such an extent that his whole religion becomes innovations and he departs from Islaam, since nothing remains from his religion from the sunnahs. [09]</p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Translator’s note: a line of poetry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] This narration has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by Imaam Ahmad , Aboo Daawood, At Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah. From the famous hadeeth of al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu. Declared authentic by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] The checking of this has preceded as a hadeeth of Jaabir radiyAllaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was reported by an-Nasaa·ee, and by Ibn Khuzaymah and it was declared saheeh by Shaykh Al-Albaanee – that, “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam when he gave a khutbah, he used to say&#8230;” and they report the wording, and it contained this wording, “and the worst of affairs are those that are newly introduced.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] Editor’s note: Part of the same hadeeth mentioned in footnote 2 of this transcript.<br />
[05] Translator’s note: meaning everything<br />
[06] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3450) and by Muslim (no. 2535) as a hadeeth of `Imraan ibn al-Husayn radiyAllaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07 <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> The explanation of Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah mentions with regard to this affair of innovations which start as something small,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the story of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood along with the people of these circles who gathered in circles in Basrah (reported by Daarimee and others) when Aboo Moosaa al-Ash`aree came to him and informed him that there are some people gathering in circles. So in the beginning all they were doing was gathering in circles and repeating words of thikr (remembrance). This, it is possible to say that this is from the smaller innovations. So then the narrator of this report said, “But then I saw most of those who were in those circles fighting against us on the Day of Nahrawaan.” SubhaanAllaah! What is meant by the Day of Nahrawaan? It is the day when `Alee radiyAllaahu `anhu fought against the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So those people of the circles what did they begin with? They began with a small innovation; it would not be counted as something major without a doubt, however their gathering in circles and the manner in which they were doing the thikr, this is the way in which it was an innovation. So tasbeeh (saying subhaanAllaah) and tahleel (saying laa ilaaha illAllaah) is not an evil act, rather it is something legislated. So what was it that Ibn Mas`ood was criticizing from them? It was the manner in which they were doing thikr. So therefore afterwards when the major innovation appeared, the innovation of the Khawaarij those people went with whom? They went along with the Khawaarij. So therefore the narrator of this report said, “So I saw most of the people of those circles fighting against us (meaning the people who were with `Alee radiyAllaahu `anhu) on the Day of Nahrawaan.” So see, this is a witness that emphasizes for us what the author rahimahullaah is saying, that innovation if it is taken lightly, people justifying it, it will continue until it becomes something major and until maybe it will lead the person to exiting/shooting out from the Religion; and the best example of that is the Khawaarij and the extreme Raafidah Shee`ah and the Baatiniyyah and the ones who follow their path.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] From `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anhu that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“How will you be when trials and tribulations overcome you to such an extent that the old person grows old upon it and the young person grows up upon it and the people take it as being Sunnah. And if it changed the people say, ‘You are changing the Sunnah.’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said, “When will that occur O Aboo Abdur-Rahman?” He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When your recitors become many and your people with understanding of the Religion become few and your rulers become many and your trustworthy ones are few and this world is sought after by means of actions which should be done for the Hereafter.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan and al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak `alas-Saheehayn and Ibn `Abdil-Barr in Jaami` Bayaanil- `ilm wa Fadlih and al-Bayhaqee in al-Madkhal ilas-Sunanil-Kubraa and others. And it is a narration which is mowqoof (a statement of a Companion, `Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood), but it has the ruling of being marfoo` (having come from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaanee rahimahullaah said about this report in his SaheehutTargheeb wat-Tarheeb (no. 111) that this report is saheeh (authentic) because of supports. It is mowqoof, a statement of the Companion. And in his book Tahreem Aalaatit-Tarb where he mentions the forbiddance of musical instruments, page 16, Shaykh Al-Albaanee said about this report, “It is mowqoof (meaning it is a statement of the Companion), but it has the ruling of coming from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam because it is a matter related to the unseen (a matter of the future) which cannot be arrived at through opinion, especially when all that was predicted in it has occurred, and Allaah&#8217;s aid is sought.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in explanation of this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“This does not mean that every innovation takes a person outside the fold of Islaam. Rather what he meant was that there were some innovations which cause a person to reach the level of kufr, disbelief, and an example of that is the innovation of the <strong>Baatiniyyah</strong> (those who say all the commands of Islaam have an outward aspect e.g. the prayer and the fasting, for the common people, then there is an inner meaning for the special elite) and the <strong>extreme Soofees</strong>, those who believe that commands and the prohibitions fall away from them (they’re no longer bound by Islaamic commands and prohibitions) and they make lawful that which Allaah has forbidden and they declare forbidden that which Allaah has made lawful. And they worship individuals and cling and devote themselves to them besides Allaah, and they believe that they are infallible or they believe that they know the ghayb (hidden and the unseen) or the like of that. These are from the innovations which reach the level of exiting from the Religion, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 08 : Point 05</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And know that the people never introduce an innovation, until they abandon its like from the Sunnah. So beware of forbidden matters, for every new introduction is an innovation (bid`ah) and every innovation is misguidance, and misguidance and its people will be in the Fire.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-people-do-not-introduce-an-innovation-except-that-they-lose-its-like-from-the-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a tremendous point of wisdom and it is something reported as a saying from the Salaf, that they said, <strong>“The people do not introduce an innovation, except that they lose its like from the Sunnah.”</strong> [01] Because the Sunnah and innovation cannot be combined, except that one of them will expel the other, so a person cannot be an innovator and a person of Sunnah. Rather either he will be an innovator or a person of the Sunnah, they cannot both be combined in him. So one of them will necessarily expel the other, and this is from the harmful effects of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this point of wisdom narrated is confirmed by experience, and the witness for this and its proof is, that you will find the people of innovation having hatred for the authentic ahaadeeth [02], and having hatred for the matters of the Sunnah (sunan). And the worst enemy to them and the most hateful thing that they can hear, is that it is said, “Such and such hadeeth prohibits such and such.” or, “It forbids such and such.” They do not want to hear the hadeeth and the sunan which contradict what they are upon. So this is a sign that the Sunnah and innovation cannot come together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who is upon the Sunnah, then if he hears a hadeeth from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam then he becomes happy with that. And he adds something good to the good which he already possesses. And he adds knowledge to his knowledge. The person of Sunnah he is happy with the ahaadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Whereas the person of innovation he has aversion for the ahaadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. This is something very clear in the innovators. And they wage war in the matters from the Sunnah, because these things put an end to the innovations which they are upon. And this is a deterrent against innovation, and that they also cause matters of the Sunnah to pass away, and they cause love of matters of the Sunnah to pass away from the hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So beware of forbidden matters.”</strong> Because forbidden matters have no good in them, whether these forbidden matters relate to shirk [03] or kufr [04] or matters of sin, because Allaah will not forbid something and there is good in it. He will only forbid something which is purely evil, or something which the evil of it outweighs the good or an evil which is equal. So if good and evil come together in something, then if the evil is more or equal then you should avoid it, and if the good is more then there is no harm in taking hold of it. And a slight evil found in it along with the greater good is excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “For every new introduction is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance.”</strong> &#8211; this is the textual wording of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu who said, “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam gave us an admonition from which the hearts trembled and the eyes shed tears, so therefore we said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as if it is the admonition given by one who is departing (a farewell admonition), so therefore advise us.’ So he, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, <span style="color:#333300;">‘<strong>I council you with being dutiful to (having taqwaa/ being fearful of) Allaah, and with hearing and obeying, even if a slave is appointed over you.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“an Abyssinian slave whose head is as if it is a raisin.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“`For whoever lives long amongst you, then he will see very great differing. So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me. Cling onto it and bite onto it with your premolar teeth. And beware of newly introduced affairs.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a warning, “iyyaaka”, “beware of”. It is a word of warning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“`Beware of newly introduced affairs, for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance.””</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration there occurs the wording,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“and every misguidance will be in the Hellfire.”</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah, an innovation, and what is meant by a newly introduced affair is: in the Religion. As for newly introduced affairs with regards to customs/everyday habits and with regard to worldly benefits and with regard to types of food and drinks and clothing, then these are innovations in the language sense. They are not innovations in the legislated sense, but rather newly introduced affairs in the Religion, they are the forbidden innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this contains a refutation of those who divide innovations into categories, dividing them into good innovations and bad innovations, and permissible innovations. And they say that they fall under the five rulings [07]; then this is a mistake, because innovations, bida`, in the Religion, all of them are misguidance, by the textual statement of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that he said, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“For every new introduction is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I think that what they have done is to enter those things which are an innovation with regards to the language, and they call these things good innovations. And innovations in the linguistic sense are permissible, for example, building schools and building accommodation buildings for students of knowledge and such as putting vowel points on the mus.hafs, (the written copy of the Qur·aan) and the like of that. They call these good innovations, but these are not innovations, these are matters that follow on from the sunnahs and are revival of the sunnahs. So building schools and building accommodation buildings for students of knowledge and printing the mus.hafs and putting vowel points on them, all of these are an aid upon knowledge, so they are something good and they are sunnahs. So these people are either taking good practices and calling them innovations, or they are calling matters of custom innovations when they do not enter into the Religion, because they are from the affairs of this world, so they do not enter into the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Fire.”</strong> &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth, “and all misguidance will be in the Fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as occurs in the hadeeth of the different sects (that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said), <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“And this nation will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except for one.”</strong></span> [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a proof that the people of innovation will be in the Fire and they vary in level. From them are those who will be in the Fire because of their disbelief, and some of them will be in the Fire because of his sin and from them will be those who remain in the Fire forever, and from them will be those who do not remain forever in it; but rather the ruling of such a person will be the same as the ruling of the people of the major sins.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Introducing innovation into the Religion leads to abandoning its like from the Sunnah</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The people of innovation have hatred for the authentic ahaadeeth (narrations) and matters of the Sunnah</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The People of the Sunnah are happy with the narrations and increase in knowledge</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allaah forbids only that which is purely evil, or its evil outweighs its good or an evil that is equal</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Slight evil found in something along with the greater good is excused</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Every innovation is misguidance and its proof</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the word ‘bid`ah’ or ‘innovation’ in the Legislation</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is not included in the legislative meaning of ‘bid`ah’</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of innovation will be in the Fire forever and some will not remain there forever</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of innovation will be in the Fire for their disbelief and some of  them will enter it due to their sin</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] It has already preceded that this was the saying of Hassaan ibn `Attiyah rahimahullaah&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for this report, that it is reported from him that he said, “No people introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah removes from their Sunnah its like, then He does not return it to them until the Day of Resurrection.” This report is mentioned as the saying of Hassaan ibn `Attiyyah, reported by ad-Daarimee and al-Laalikaa·ee and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee in his checking of al-Mishkaat. Shaykh Al-Albaanee said in al-Mishkaat (no. 188), “And it is also related as being a saying of Aboo Hurayrah reported by Abul-`Abbaas al-Asam in a hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Refer to the continuation of the footnote in the Maktabatur-Rushd edition of this book for a quote from Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah on this point with regard to the people of innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Editor’s note: plural of the Arabic word ‘hadeeth’<br />
[03] Editor’s note: polytheism<br />
[04] Editor’s note: disbelief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] This (hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah) has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah. This hadeeth was declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This particular wording occurs in a hadeeth of Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah radiyAllaahu `anhumaa reported by an-Nasaa·ee as hadeeth 1578, in the Book of the Two `Eed prayers, Chapter 22, How The Khutbah is Given; also reported by Ibn Khuzaymah, where he mentioned Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam used to give a khutbah (an address) and he would praise Allaah and repeat words of praise upon Him as He deserves, and then he would say,<strong><span style="color:#008080;"><span style="color:#333300;"> “Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides, then none can guide him. And the truest speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best way is the Way of Muhammad. And the worst of affairs are the newly introduced affairs, and every newly introduced affair is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance is in the Fire.</span>” </span></strong>Shaykh alAlbaanee declared that narration saheeh (authentic) also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07]<strong> Translator’s side point:</strong> What they meant was the five rulings of Islaam, the five rulings of all affairs, meaning: 1. those things which are obligatory, 2. those things which are recommended, 3. those things which are permissible 4. those things which are disliked and 5. those things which are forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] The checking for this has preceded.<br />
<strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by at-Tirmithee and al-Haakim, and declared hasan (good) by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] Translator’s side point abridged from the explanation of Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullah on the same point as the author,<strong> “And know that the people do not introduce innovation until they leave its like from the Sunnah”</strong>: He mentions the seriousness of this matter of introducing innovations, that when a person does that, he does two forbidden things. A person introduces an innovation into his Religion, then he has introduced an innovation which is forbidden and he will have abandoned a matter of the Sunnah which is also something forbidden. Then he gives some evidences for that; some aayahs from Sooratul-Anfaal the 24th and 25th aayahs; Sooratun-Noor, the 24th soorah, aayahs 48-50; and Sooratun-Nisaa·, aayah 115; and he explains those aayahs. Then he says at the end of the discussion,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So there is a threat upon the person who abandons matters of the Sunnah and introduces innovations, there is a tremendous threat away from it&#8230;” And he mentions more of these aayahs. “&#8230;And likewise as occurs in His Saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever contends with the Messenger after the Guidance has been made clear to him, and follows others than the way of the Believers, then We will land him in the path he has chosen and We will burn him in the Fire of Hell, and what an evil destination.</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just as occurs in the saying of the Prophet sallAllaahu alayhi wa salaam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>‘All of my nation will enter Paradise, except for those who refuse.’ So they said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah and who would refuse?’ So he said, ‘Whoever obeys me he will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me then he has refused.’ </strong></span>(Hadeeth reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 7280)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person of innovation is one who is disobedient to Allaah and his Messenger. He is following his desires, venerating his own self, claiming by his condition that his opinion and his desires are better than that which the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam came with. So therefore beware from being from those people, such that you will have the threat of the Fire upon you, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lil-Barbahaaree, pp 50-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah mentioned in his explanation the famous saying of Imaam Sufyaan Ath-Thowree rahimahullaah, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees (the devil) than sin, because a person may repent from sin, but a person does not repent from innovation.”</strong> </span>(Reported by al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah).</p>

<p><span class="fontstyle0">Imaam al-Barbahaaree </span>rahimahullaah <span class="fontstyle0">said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the foundation which the Jamaa`ah is built upon is the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, may Allaah have mercy upon all of them. And they are the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the People of the Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth.

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the foundation upon which the Jamaa`ah is built upon”</strong> – who are the Jamaa`ah who have this status? They are the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who come after them from the Taabi`een (their successors) and from the successors of the Taabi`een, and the most excellent generations. They are the Jamaa`ah and whoever follows them from the later peoples, they are the Jamaa`ah; those whom it is obligatory upon the Muslims to be with, whatever harm comes upon him and whatever threats and whatever blame and whatever attacks &#8211; he should still have patience upon that and he should bear it, as long as he is upon the Truth. So he should not deviate away from the Truth, rather he should have patience upon whatever befalls him, otherwise he will just be a target for those people with evil intentions and the callers to evil and the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen (the Muslims who emigrated from Makkah) and the Ansaar (the Muslims of Madeenah who gave them shelter) and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him</strong></span>.[1] (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High, when He mentioned the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar in Sooratul-Hashr, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them they say, O our Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Eemaan and do not place any ill feeling in our hearts towards those who truly believe. O our Lord, you are Compassionate, Merciful.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who comes later he follows the earlier one from the people of the Truth and good even if there is a long period of time between him and them, he adheres to what they were upon no matter what it costs him, he should have patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam”</strong> &#8211; from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar because they were the ones who accompanied the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they fought jihaad along with him and they aided him and they bore the Religion and they conveyed it to us; so they are the intermediaries between us and between Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So those people who abuse the Companions or belittle them, they only want to demolish Islaam; however they come with this ploy. So when they speak against the Companions and they devalue them, then what will remain at that time from the intermediary that is between us and the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Their intent is to cut off the connection with the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar so that the nation will go astray; otherwise what else could lead them to abusing the Companions? Did they have any dispute with the Companions with regard to money or something else? Have the Companions caused them any personal harm when there are many centuries between them and the Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them to this is hatred in the hearts, because the Companions they are the ones who bore this Religion. So they want to cut off the link between the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his nation so that this Religion falls. This is their intent.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they (the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) are the People of the Sunnah and of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth).”</strong> The Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who came after them, those who followed them upon good, they are the People of the Sunnah, meaning the people of the correct path; and it is the ‘Sunnah’ which we have explained in this book (the Sunnah referring to the path that which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the true Jamaa`ah; but as for the uniting of others besides them, upon false and futile matters then they are not called the Jamaa`ah even if they are many in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You think that they are all together but their hearts are actually divided.</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Hashr 59, aayah 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Jamaa`ah is whoever is upon the Truth. So the person who says, “I am with such-and-such hizb (party); this group is a jamaa`ah and you people say, “Adhere to the Jamaa`ah” and they are a jamaa`ah.” So we say to them, “Who said to you that those people are the Jamaa`ah. The Jamaa`ah is those who are upon the Truth; whoever is upon the Sunnah, they are the Jamaa`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever does not take from them (the Companions radiyAllaahu `anhum) then he has gone astray and has innovated.”</strong> Whoever does not take his Religion from the Companions, those who are the conveyers of the Book and the Sunnah, then he is not upon the Truth. So if they are attacked and accused then what they convey is nullified, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And the intent of the enemies of Allaah and His Messenger is indeed to nullify Islaam, however they came with this filthy trick in order to cause a separation between the later people and the early people from the Muslims, so that it will be easy for them to devour the later people and easy to chew them up. But as for if the people tie themselves to the first Jamaa`ah and to the Book and the Sunnah then that will never be easy for them to do, indeed it will be impossible for them to chew them up by the permission of Allaah. His saying, “then he has gone astray” – meaning he has strayed away from the Truth and become lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“and he has innovated”</strong>&#8211; Innovation is whatever is from the matters of worship or from matters of creed and beliefs or from sayings and it does not have a proof from the Book and the Sunnah (that is an innovation). He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected.”</strong> </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced matters for every newly introduced matter is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance”</strong></span> [5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovation is whatever has been introduced into the Religion and it is not from it. And how can it be known that it is not from it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it does not have a daleel, a proof, then it is not from the Religion, because Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you</strong></span> [6]<br />
(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion is complete, and all praise is for Allaah; it does not accept any additions. So it is just upon us to come to know of the Religion which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic completed, and to cling to it and that we abandon whatever is besides it from additions and from things which people deem to be good introductions and from supplements and from other than that, because these things only take people farther away from Allaah the Majestic and Most High. And there will follow a clarification that: No people introduce an innovation except that its like (a like amount of it) will be taken away from the Sunnah.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the correct and straight path, adhering to the Jamaa`ah, adhering to the Sunnah and abandoning innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And every innovation is misguidance”</strong> – so there is no such thing as bid`ah hasanah, ‘good innovation’, as some people say. Rather all innovations are misguidance by the textual statement of the hadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“For every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid`ah) and every innovation is misguidance.”</span></strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovations in the Religion, there is nothing good from them at all, rather all of them are misguidance and this is the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam who did not speak from desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Hell Fire”</strong> &#8211; Misguidance and the people of misguidance will be in the Fire, either on account of their disbelief or on account of sin. So innovations are not of one level only. Some of them are kufr, disbelief, such that its person will be forever in the Fire, such as seeking aid from the dead and making supplication to the dead and making sacrifice to other than Allaah and making vows to other than Allaah &#8211; so these are innovations which are disbelief, kufr. And likewise denying the Names of Allaah and His and Attributes as is said by the Jahmiyyah, those who deny the Names and Attributes. So this is kufr, disbelief, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, because they describe Allaah as not having names or attributes; so in that case He would be nonexistent! Because that which exists must have attributes and the one who has no attributes does not exist. And therefore the Imaams judged that the Jahmiyyah are disbelievers, those who said that the Qur·aan is a created thing. So they made the Qur·aan which is the Speech of Allaah and His Revelation and that which He sent down, they made it a created thing, such as the rest of the created things. And they said Allaah does not speak so therefore they likened Him to an inanimate object; and one who does not speak cannot be a god/one deserving of worship. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the people of Moosaa in his absence made out of the jewellery of the Copts a calf in bodily form which produced a mooing sound. Do they not then see that it could not speak to them and nor could it guide them upon the way?</strong> </span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that the one who does not speak cannot be an ilaah, one deserving of worship; whereas the Jahmiyyah say Allaah does not speak, so therefore He would not be one deserving of worship, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. And there occurs in Soorah Taahaa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not see that it cannot respond to them with any saying and it does not possess any power to harm or benefit them.</strong></span> (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the calf &#8211; if they were to speak to it, it could not respond to them, so therefore was it befitting that it could be one deserving of worship? [9] And Ibraaheem `alayhissalaam said to the worshippers of the idols:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You already know that they (these idols) can’t speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all and cannot harm you. Uff (word of anger and disgust) to you and to that which you worship besides Allaah! Do you have no intellect which prevents you from this?</strong></span> (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), aayahs 66-67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, call upon Me, I will respond to you.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described Himself that He says and He speaks. So the one who does not speak He is not one deserving of worship. So therefore many of the Imaams declared the heads of the Jahmiyyah to be disbelievers, but not their blind followers or those who were just followers, those to whom the Truth had not become clear, but rather they were just blindly following upon ignorance. Those people are a case for examination and the matter must be clarified to them, and then if they persist, then judgement that they are disbelievers will be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Foot notes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In tafseer of this aayah ‘And the first and foremost ones’ the people of tafseer such as at-Tabaree and those who came after them like al-Baghawee, as-Sam`aanee, Ibn Katheer and others mention a number of different sayings with regard to who are those actually meant by ‘the first and foremost ones’ (from the Muslims). Amongst what at-Tabaree brings, he brings with an authentic chain of narration from the noble Taabi`ee Sa`eed ibnul-Musayyib that he said, “The first Muhaajireen (referred to here) they are the ones who prayed towards both qiblahs” meaning the ones who accepted Islaam before the qiblah was changed, so they prayed toward Jerusalem then when the qiblah was changed they prayed towards Makkah afterwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the great Salafee mufassir Aboo Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee in his tafseer, he mentioned four saying in explanation of this aayah. One of the sayings, he mentioned this same saying as Sa`eed ibnul Musayyib and he mentioned it also from Ibn Sireen and a group. Then he mentioned three further saying as well with regards to who are ‘the first and foremost ones’. The first saying he mentioned was that they are the people of Badr, meaning the people who fought at Badr; they had accepted Islaam by that time, in the second year. The second saying he quotes is that they are the people of Bay`atur-Ridwaan, the people who gave the pledge at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in Thul-Qa`dah in the sixth year. The third saying he quoted is that the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen are the ones who accepted Islaam before the Hijrah, and the first and foremost ones from the Ansaar are those who gave the pledge to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam on the night of `Aqabah just before the Hijrah, those who accepted Islaam in Madeenah and they came for the Hajj and gave the pledge of `Aqabah to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Shaykul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah preferred the view that they were those who accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and as it is known that those at the treaty of Hudaybiyyah were one thousand and four hundred and more in number. Likewise Shaykh al-Fowzaan said the same thing in his explanation of al-Waasitiyyah, that ‘the first and foremost ones’ refers to those who had accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in the eleventh month of the sixth year. An evidence for that is an aayah from Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not equal, those who spent in charity before the Conquest (meaning the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah) and who fought&#8230;(to the end of the aayah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation, “The author rahimahullaah explained the importance of following and of adhering to this methodology, and that the foundation of that methodology is what we have explained a short while ago, that the foundation of the Jamaa`ah is, after Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, the Companions ridwaanullaahi `alayhim ajma`een (may Allaah be pleased with them all). So whoever makes an attack upon the Companions then he has made an attack upon the whole of Islaam and whoever abuses the Companions then he has abused Islaam and whoever maligns and attacks the Companions, then he has spoken against and accused Islaam and whoever belittles the Companions then he has belittled Islaam. Why is this the case? Because they are the ones who conveyed Islaam to us so if it were not for them Islaam would not have reached us, if it were not for the Companions, Islaam would not have reached us, for Islaam only came to us by way of them. They are the ones who conveyed the Qur·aan to us and they are the ones who conveyed the Sunnah to us and therefore Allaah praised them for that&#8230; So whoever claims that they left Islaam, became apostates (the same as the Raafidah Shee`ah say) or that they changed and altered then he is the apostate and he is the one who is changing and altering and he is the one who is making a change in the Religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) and reported by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form in his Saheeh from a hadeeth of Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no.2 550) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) from Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is part of a hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu, and its checking has preceded. Translator’s side point: The checking of this hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and it was declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This aayah came down on the day of `Arafah on the 10th year of the Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is) a famous saying from Imaam Maalik: So whatever was not Religion on that day it will never be Religion today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Hassaan ibn `Atiyyah (from the Taabi`een) rahimahullaah said, “A people never introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah takes away from their Sunnah its like and then He does not return it to them right until the Day of Resurrection.” Reported by ad-Daarimee and Aboo Nu`aym in al-Hilyah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regards to this Taabi`ee, Hassaan ibn Atiyyah, Shaykh al-Albaanee said in his notes to al-Mishkaat, “He was a great and noble Taabi`ee who died in the year 130.” Shaykh alAlbaanee said with regard to this report from him, “Its chain of narration is saheeh and its like is also reported as a saying of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu reported by Abul-`Abbaas ibn al-Assam in his hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] This occurs in a number of ahaadeeth, from them the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah which has just preceded, also a hadeeth of Jaabir reported by an-Nasaa·ee (no. 1578) and also by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh; and the basis of this hadeeth occurs in Saheeh Muslim (no. 768).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] <strong>Translator’s note:</strong> Of course not!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah :</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Who are the Jam`aah whom it is obligatory for the Muslims to follow?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The intent of those who speak against the Companions</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the term Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The definition of bid`ah, innovation in the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Every (religious) innovation is misguidance</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The people of misguidance will be in the Fire</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Denying Allaah’s Names and Attributes is kufr, disbelief</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A refutation of the Jahmiyyah who deny Allaah’s Speech</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Hawd &amp; The Kawthar (The Pool &amp; The River)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] They believe in the Hawd [102] and the Kawthar. Also in the entering of a group of Ahl ut-Tawheed into Paradise without account. There will also be a group from them who will have an easy reckoning, without any harm befalling them, or any punishment overtaking them. A group from them who had sinned will enter the Fire, then they will be freed and led out of it and joined up with their brothers who preceded them in entering Paradise. [103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They ( i.e. Ahl Hadeeth ) know with certainty and truth that the sinful from amongst the Ahl ut Tawlieed will not remain in the Fire eternally, and will not be left there forever. [104] As for the unbelievers, they shall abide in Hell forever and never come out of it nor shall they ever be reprieved. Allaah will never leave in the Fire anyone, who was disobedient from Ahl ul-Eemaan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Definition of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the followers of <strong>Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong>. There are several points to be noted about their methodology, the most important of which are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They show a <strong>lack of importance to Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah</strong> [1], which is the most important matter in Islaam, since the Islaam of an individual is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They remain silent and concede to the people in their performance of major Shirk, supplication to other than Allaah, performance of tawaaf around graves, making oaths to the dead in the graves, sacrificing in their names and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this methodology was a <strong>Sufi</strong>. He had a connection with Sufism to the point that he gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Al-Khusaafee upon (following) his Khusaafee Shadh-lee order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The presence of innovations amongst them and their worshipping Allaah through them – even to the point that the founder of this methodology acknowledged that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would attend their gatherings of dhikr and that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would forgive what past sins they had committed, as is found in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“May Allaah bless the one who upon light in which he appeared<br />
To the worlds, and so he surpassed the sun and the moon<br />
This habeeb (i.e. Muhammad) along with his beloved has gathered<br />
And pardoned everyone in what sins they did in the past.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They call to <strong>establishing the Khilaafah</strong> and this is an innovation because the Messengers and their followers were not entrusted with anything except to call to Tawheed. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger, (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah and avoid the taaghoot (false deities).’”</b></span>[Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They have a <strong>lack of Walaa and Baraa</strong> (loyalty and disavowment) or a weak form of it. This is made clear in their call to bring closeness between the Sunnis and the Shee’ah. And their founder was quoted as saying: “We will cooperate with one another in what we agree on and pardon one another in what we disagree on.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <strong>They hate and despise the people of Tawheed</strong> and those who adhere to the Salafee Way. This is made clear in their talk concerning the Saudi state, which is founded upon Tawheed and which teaches Tawheed in its schools, institutes and universities. And it was made clear in their killing of Jameel Ar-Rahmaan Al-Afghaanee just because he called to Tawheed and because he had schools in which he would teach Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <strong>They pursue the mistakes of the leaders</strong> and expose their faults – whether true or false – spreading them amongst the youth in order to make the leaders appear hateful to them and so that they can fill their hearts with contempt against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. They hold detestable <strong>partisanship to the party</strong> they ascribe themselves to. So they show friendship based on this party and they show enmity based on this party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They give their <strong>oath of allegiance to work for the Ikhwaani Manhaj</strong> according to the ten conditions that the founder has set forth. And there are other issues of concern, which perhaps can be dealt with at a later time.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#808080;">Footnotes</span>:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This is the category of Tawheed related to the Oneness of Allaah in the worship that is performed to Him, i.e. that we worship only Allaah and no one else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to <strong>Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen</strong>. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong>They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger</strong>. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims – all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <strong>They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers.</strong> Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs</strong>. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">About a week ago, I (Dawud Adib) received an image in a Whatsapp forum indicating that the noble scholar Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan was standing at the bedside of one of the most notorious people of misguidance of our time, A&#8217;id al-Qarni. Within hours of that picture’s release, there was an abundance of comments—many unfavorable—about the Shaykh&#8217;s visit. One brother who was dismayed about this visit cited to me the statement of al-Imam al-Barbahari concerning not visiting the innovator or deviant who has fallen sick, from his <em>Explanation of the Creed</em>. Although the brother was sincere, he had become confused by the actions of the Shaykh, since, in his mind, they were at least in contradiction to this basic Salafi principle on how we deal with the People of Desires, Deviation, and Misguidance, or maybe even in opposition to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I responded to the brother with two narrations: one from the best caller to Allah, Abul-Qasim Muhammad bin ‘Abdillah bin ‘Abdil-Muttalib (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace), and the other from the Imam of the People of the Sunnah and Jama&#8217;ah of his time, al-Imam Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I explained to the brother that this affair (visiting the innovator or deviant who has fallen sick) is not as black and white as one may think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جاء في صحيح البخاري من طريق حماد بن زيد عن ثابت عن أنس رضي الله عنه قال. كان غلام يهودي يخدم النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فمَرض فأتاه النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يعوده فقعد عند رأسه فقال له. أسلم. فنظر إلى أبيه وهو عنده فقال له أطع أبا القاسم صلى الله عليه وسلم. فأسلم فخرج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو يقول. الحمد لله الذي أنقذه من النار.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It was reported in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> from Hammad bin Zayd from Thabit that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “There was a Jewish boy who used to serve the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>). He fell sick, and the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>) went to visit him. He sat at his head and said to him, ‘Accept Islam.’ (The boy) looked towards his father, who was with him. (His father) said, ‘Obey Abul-Qasim (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>).’ So he accepted Islam, and the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>) went out (from his house) saying, ‘Praise be to Allah Who has saved him from the Hell-Fire.’ ” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I told the brother that there are many benefits from this narration, and one of them that clearly stands out was the Prophet&#8217;s (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace) zealousness to have people guided and saved from the Fire by the permission of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other authentic narration is from al-Imam Ahmad, found in the book <em>Ahl al-Milal war-Riddah waz-Zanadiqah wa-Tarik as-Salah wal-Fara&#8217;id min Kitab al-Jami</em> by Ahmad bin Muhammad Khallal, in The Book of Funerals, Chapter of Visiting the Sick, #602:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قال الفضل بن زياد سمعت أحمد بن حنبل سئل عن الرجل المسلم يعود أحداً من المشركين، قال: إن كان يرى أنه إذا عاده يعرض عليه الإسلام يقبل منه فليعده كما عاد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم الغلام اليهودي فعرض عليه الإسلام.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Fadl bin Ziyad said, “I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal being asked about a Muslim individual visiting one of the pagans who had fallen ill. He [al-Imam Ahmad] said, ‘If he thinks that if he visits him while he is sick and tells him about Islam, he may accept it, then let him visit him, as the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>) visited the Jewish boy who was sick and told him about Islam.’ ” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some days later, I came across an article posted on <a href="http://www.sahab.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahab.net</a> from someone responding to the same issue the brother and I were discussing, which provided an elaborate explanation to this timely affair. May Allah bless the brother and Sahab for their efforts in assisting Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The following is my translation of his response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allah, Lord of all the worlds. In addition, may prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, the most honored of the Messengers. As to what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As salamu ‘alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has been an increase in lectures and clamor from the People of Deviation and Desires, from amongst the Qutubis and Takfiris and their apprentices, concerning the [recent] visit of the erudite scholar Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah protect and preserve him) to a [well-known] caller of fitnah. This individual who has deviated from the methodology of the Prophet (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace) and his Companions [is none other than] A’id al-Qarni.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some students of knowledge have become puzzled about this matter, while others have become despondent. Likewise, some of the general masses of the People of the Sunnah have begun to doubt and their hearts have differed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, I would like to point out some matters that clearly indicate the harmony of this methodology, its deep-rooted firmness, and its constancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The [true, erudite] scholar of the People of the Sunnah and Jama’ah is like the ruler who has [the responsibility of] the affairs of the citizens [in his hands]. He is the most knowledgeable of what benefits them and of what assists the call to Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result, Allah has referred matters of a calamitous, problematic nature to their formal legal opinions and judgments. This is not [the case] for those other than them. Thus, [the meaning of what] Allah the Most High has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And when there comes to them information about [public] security or fear, they spread it around. However, if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have followed the Shaytan, except for a few.&#8221;</strong> [Surah an-Nisa 4:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, there is [a clear] distinction between the common people and the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: This visit to this obstinate contravener [to the Book of Allah, the pure Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad and the methodology of the righteous Salaf] did not occur without [thorough] familiarity (with the issue) and [deep] research. If people have these types of thoughts about them [the scholars], then they [in reality] have judged them as those who waste time and indulge in frivolous entertainment, which is not commensurate with their [deep] knowledge and [vast] experience. Indeed, the major, senior scholars have spent their youth being actively engaged in seeking knowledge and shunning enjoyment and pleasures during the prime of their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how could this ever be assumed about them in their advanced age when worldly desires have been suppressed in their hearts, and while they are [consistently] upon what they have been upon?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: If we really understand these two principles from the two aforementioned points, [then we will also come to know and understand that] the scholar has already realized the predominant public benefit in visiting the adamant infringer for the purpose of advising and establishing proofs [against the infringer’s deviations and misguidance]. This is known from the [actions of the] Companions and their followers from amongst the Salaf of this ummah. Amongst the utmost proofs for this is ‘Ali bin Abi Talib sending Ibn ‘Abbas to the Khawarij for a discussion, causing a number of them to return to the truth right on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[That discussion] brings to mind two narrations from al-Imam Ahmad, [the first] from al-Imam Abu Dawud on p.276 of <em>Masa’il of al-Imam Ahmad</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(a)</strong> I [al-Imam Abu Dawud] said to Ahmad, “We have relatives residing in Khorasan who have adopted the views of al-Irja’. So when we write to Khorasan, should we also extend to them the greetings of peace?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad retorted, “Subhanallah! You do not extend to them the greetings of peace?” So I said to Ahmad, “We should speak to them?” He said, “Yes, unless they are callers to [these deviated beliefs] and quarrel with [you] concerning them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Muflih said in “Al-Adab ash-Shar’iyyah,” vol. 1, p.229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(b)</strong> In the narration of al-Fadl: “It was said to [al-Imam Ahmad], ‘And should one speak to any of them?’ He said, ‘Yes, unless you know of any nifaq from them, because the Prophet (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace) feared for the three [Companions] who stayed behind (from the campaign to Tabuk), thus he ordered the people not to speak to them. I said, ‘O Aba ‘Abdillah! Then how should the People of Desires be dealt with?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He replied, ‘As for the Jahmiyyah and Rafidah, then no [do not speak to them].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Then it was said to him, ‘So [what about] the Murji’ah?’ He replied, ‘They are less complicated, unless they are those who quarrel [with you]—then do not speak with them.’ ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that the judgment to meet with the People of Innovation to advise them in a particular matter goes back to the scholars, who possess the discretional ability to deal with critical situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Shaykh Salih (may Allah preserve and protect him) has never been known for trying to win applause, having affection for or displaying flattery to the People of Innovations, or including them in [the fold of those who adhere to] the methodology of the Salaf like those who oppose it do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the contrary, he continues to unleash upon them a firm, unchangeable, cast-iron tongue. He upbraids them; even more than that, he orders to withdraw from them and not come close to them. This is known from his writings and legal decisions to those near and far.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: As we have already clarified, Shaykh Salih (may Allah preserve and protect him) has not opposed the methodology of the Salaf, just as the erudite scholar Shaykh Rabi’ has not opposed it regarding this matter, the matter of giving advice and being patient with the obstinate violator [of the methodology of the Salaf]. Shaykh Rabi’ has displayed mammoth restraint toward the pig-headed opponent [of the Salafi methodology]. Everyone knows that he was patient with ‘Abdur-Rahman ‘Abdul-Khaliq for ten years before speaking out against him. At the same time, [Shaykh Nasir ad-Din al-Albani] (may Allah’s mercy be upon him) has distinguished [Shaykh Rabi’] with the title “the carrier of the flag of [knowledge] of Jarh wa Ta&#8217;dil,” which is why the enemies have unsheathed their swords against him. Assuredly, this is a distinct characteristic that Allah gives to whomever He wants, just as He distinguished al-Imam Ahmad in standing against the innovators, although during his time there existed many [renowned] scholars who were persecuted and killed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Those People of Desires, from amongst them the Haddadis and Qutubis, deem Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan as being from the remnants of the Salaf. They have said this about him; the innovator [Abu Ishaq] al-Huwayni recently called him “the remnant of the Salaf.” This is a proof that they deem him to be an extraordinary erudite scholar from among the scholars who call to the Sunnah. Despite this, they do not desire to follow the methodology of Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan in the issue of not revolting against the ruler, the issue of mawazanat, or the issue of bombings and calling a Muslim a disbeliever. This is because they oppose the Shaykh, heart and soul. But they are persistent about those issues in which Shaykh al-Fawzan and Shaykh Rabi’ have differed, focusing on those affairs to create conflict between the Salafi scholars and students of knowledge. Likewise, they intend to confuse and deceive the masses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, Shaykh Salih did not go out in opposition to the ruler (King Salman), may Allah protect and preserve them both, as the Takfiri Qutubis have done in revolting against the rulers and declaring them disbelievers. Rather, he went out on the authorization and order of the king (may Allah protect and preserve them both). Likewise, his visit has not opposed his previous comments regarding the callers of fitnah, and his visit is not a green light allowing the common Muslims to listen to the lessons and lectures of those individuals or to sit with them. How could it be so, when he himself has explained the narration regarding the strike of the tongue at the end of time being like the blows of the sword?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translator&#8217;s note: It should be noted that the aforementioned narration of &#8220;the strike of the tongue will be like the blows of the sword,&#8221; collected by Imams at-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah, is weak. This is due to the uncertainty of one of the narrators named Ziyad bin Saymin or Simin Kush, and the weakness of Layth bin Abi Sulaym. More than likely the Shaykh was using it to cite a point and Allah knows best!]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the people to avoid the callers of fitnah and hold on to the well-known scholars. And [Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan] has not opposed the methodology of the Salaf in his evaluation of the benefits and wisdoms of calling to Allah the Most High, as I have previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Allah comes every source of goodness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on some people who sway from right to left and backwards and forwards while reciting the Qur&#8217;an? Please advise, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Swaying while reciting the Qur&#8217;an is one of the habits that should be abandoned. It contradicts the etiquettes required when reciting the Qur&#8217;an. When reciting or listening to the Qur&#8217;an, a person should listen carefully and not play with things so that the listener and the reciter ponder over the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an and their hearts be submissive to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Scholars mentioned that this is one of the habits of the Jews when reciting their Book, and we are forbidden to imitate them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">l praise is for Allaah with much praises and blessings, as our Lord loves and is pleased with and as is required for attaining the honor of His most Sublime Face.[1] And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our teacher Muhammad, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, his family and his companions.</span>Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“Islaam began as something strange and it will return to being strange as it began. So Toobaa [2] is for the strangers.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have also reported this hadeeth on the authority of Ibn Mas’ood, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with the addition at the end of it:<b>“It was said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who are the strangers?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘The Nuzaa’ (those who extract themselves) from their families and close relatives.’</b>” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr Al-Aajuree also transmitted it and in his report there occurs: <b>&#8220;It was said: ‘Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘Those who rectify (themselves/others) when the people have become corrupt.’”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others have transmitted it with the following words, in which he, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;They are those who flee from trials (fitan) for the sake of their Religion.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhee reported it from the hadeeth of Katheer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Maznee on the authority of his father who reported from his grandfather that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Verily, this Religion began as something strange. And it will go back to being something strange. So Toobaa is for the strangers – those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me of my Sunnah.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been transmitted by At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of Jaabir, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, on the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And in the hadeeth there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It was said: &#8216;And who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He said: &#8216;They are those who rectify and make corrections when the people have become corrupted.&#8221;</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (At-Tabaraanee) also reported it from the hadeeth of Sahl Ibn Sa&#8217;ad, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with a similar wording.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad also transmitted it from the hadeeth of Sa’ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, on the authority of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And it is stated in the hadeeth: <b>“So Toobaa on that day will be for the strangers – when the people have become corrupt.”</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration transmitted by Imaam Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, the Prophet,<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Toobaa is for the strangers.”</b> It was said: “And who are the strangers? He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are more numerous than those who obey them.”</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been reported on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, in marfoo’ and mawqoof [11] form in this hadeeth, that: “It was said: ‘Who are the strangers?’ He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘They are the ones who flee for the sake of their Religion. Allaah, may He be Exalted, will send them with ‘Eesaa Bin Maryam’”</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, statement: <b>“Islaam began as something strange”</b>, then it is referring to the people before his advent, who were upon widespread deviance. This is as the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“Indeed Allaah looked at the people of the earth and hated them, both Arabs and non-Arabs, except for some remnants that were from the People of the Book.”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling towards Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice &#8211; to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant. And they continued to be upon this condition during the times of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (during their Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaytaan (Devil) unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>) and<b>Desires</b> (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of Shaytaan was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from among them were those who entered into obedience to him by way of the evil of Doubts (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>). And from among them, were those who fell into the evil of Desires (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>). And from among them, were those who combined between them both. All of that was from what the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, had warned us would occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>As for the evil of Doubts:</b><br />
Then it has been reported on the Prophet through many paths of narration that his ummah would divide into more than seventy sects. This is based on the differing found in the reports concerning the exact number with which they will exceed the number seventy. And it is reported on him, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, that all of these groups will be in the Hellfire, except for one group – and it is that (group) which adheres to what he and his companions were upon (during their time). [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And as for the evil of Desires:</b><br />
It is reported in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“When the treasures of the Persians and the Romans are opened for you, how will your people be?”</b> ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Awf,<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, said: “We will say what Allaah has ordered us (to say).”[15] He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Or other than that. You will compete against each other, then you will envy one another, then you will turn your backs on one another.”</b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree on the authority of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“I swear by Allaah! It is not poverty that I fear for you. Rather, what I fear the most for you is that the pleasures of this world will be presented to you as they were presented to those before you. And you will compete against each other for it, as they competed against each other. And it will destroy you, just as it destroyed them.”</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, a hadeeth from the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when the treasures of Kissra (Chosroes) were opened for ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, he began to weep and said: <b>“Indeed this (treasure) did not open upon a people ever, except that Allaah placed discord between them.”</b> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to fear these two evils (of Doubts and Desires) for his ummah as has been reported in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad on the authority of Abu Barzah that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Indeed, I only fear for you the desires of transgression found in your stomachs and your private parts and the calamities (fitan) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> And in another narration there occurs: <b>&#8220;&#8230;and the desires (hawaa) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a majority of the people fell victim to either or both of these evils, they began to cut off ties with one another and they began to hate one another. This only came after them having been brothers, loving and supporting one another. Indeed the evil of <b>Desires</b> became something common and accepted amongst a majority of the creatures. And it tested people by way of the worldly life and its pleasures. So that became the goal of the people’s striving. They sought after it and became pleased with it. They became angry due to it and they hated for its sake and loved for its sake. Because of this, they would sever family relations and spill blood unlawfully. And for this purpose, they committed disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evil of <b>Doubts</b> and vain desires that lead astray, then it was because of this that the Muslims divided and became sects, some groups declaring others as disbelievers. Thus, they became enemies, divided into groups and parties. This only happened after having been brothers. Their hearts were united upon the heart of one man. So not one of all these sects is saved, except for the one saved sect (<i>Al-Firqat-un-Naajiyah</i>). And they are the ones mentioned in the saying of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There will not cease to be a group from my ummah triumphant upon the truth. Those who oppose them will not be able to harm them, nor will those who abandon them, until Allaah’s order comes about (Day of Judgment) and they are in that state.”</b>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be the strangers – the ones who have been mentioned in the previous ahaadeeth – during the Last Days. They are the ones who will correct others when the people have become corrupt. They are those who will rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah. They are the ones who will flee from affliction for the sake of their Religion. They are the ones who will extract themselves from their close relatives (for Allaah’s sake).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because they are so few that you will not find any among them in an entire tribe (family), except one or two. In some tribes, you will not find any of them, just as it was when the first people entered into Islaam. This is the way the majority of the scholars have explained this hadeeth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">FOOTNOTES:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] What is meant here is the attainment of Paradise in which the people who are granted it will be able to see the Face of Allaah, as has been stated in various texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] It is said that Toobaa means something good. Allaah mentions this word in Surat-ur-Ra’ad of His Final Revelation: <b>“Those who believe and do righteous deeds, Toobaa is for them and a pleasant destination.”</b> According to Ibn Katheer’s Tafseer (Abridged 1/281), Ibraaheem An-Nakha’ee (rahimahullaah), the great Taabi’ee, said it means “good is for them.” Qataadah said: “When a man says Toobaa for you it means you have attained something good. ‘Ikrimah and Mujaahid said that Toobaa means Paradise. And it is also said that Toobaa refers to a tree in Paradise which the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, spoke of when he said: <b>“Verily, there is a tree in Paradise under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred years without being able to cover (it’s distance) completely.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim] This is what seems to be indicated in the above hadeeth, due to another hadeeth reported on the Prophet, in which he said: <b>“Toobaa is a tree in Paradise. Its (shade’s) distance (in traveling) is one hundred years. And the garments of the inhabitants of Paradise will be extracted from its branches.”</b> Imaam Al-Albaanee graded it hasan in his Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 1985).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Muslim (1/130): See Sharh Saheeh Muslim of Imaam An-Nawawee (2/175-176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3988), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (5/18) and he said it was authentic, Musnad Ahmad (5/296). It has also been recorded by Al-Khattaabee in his <i>Ghareeb-ul-Hadeeth</i> (1/175). Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared it weak (<i>da&#8217;eef</i>) in his collection <i>Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 1273)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This hadeeth is also reported by Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee and it is saheeh as has been stated by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 1). However the hadeeth with a different wording from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Sanah is weak. See <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] This hadeeth was reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Sunan (5/18) and he said it was saheeh. It was also reported by Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in <i>Al-Kaamil</i> (6/2080), At-Tabaraanee in <i>Al-Kabeer</i>(17/16), Abu Nu&#8217;aim in <i>Al-Hilyah</i> (2/10) and Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in Al-Jaami&#8217; (1/112) as well as others. In his checking to the book <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> of Imaam Ash-Shaatibee (1/22), Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee said concerning At-Tirmidhee&#8217;s authentication of this hadeeth: &#8220;This is from the hadeeth that he, may Allaah have mercy on him, has overlooked. For indeed, Katheer (Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah) is very weak. Rather, Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee accused him of being a liar! And he described him with that (lying) as being one of his main supports, as occurs in<i>Manaaqib-ush-Shaafi&#8217;ee</i> of Al-Bayhaqee (1/547-548). This is a criticism (<i>jarh</i>) that reaches the highest level of severity. Thus his hadeeth are to be disregarded completely.&#8221; Therefore, the hadeeth is da&#8217;eef jiddan (very weak) as is stated in <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 13) and <i>Da’eef Al-Jaami’-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 1441)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] This hadeeth has been reported by At-Tahaawee in <i>Mushkil-ul-Aathaar</i> (1/298), Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (2/112), and Al-Bayhaqee in <i>Az-Zuhd-ul-Kabeer</i> (200). Al-Haythamee attributed it to At-Tabaraanee in his book <i>Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278), saying: &#8220;In its chain is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih, the scribe of Laith, and he is weak. However, he has been declared reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] At-Tabaraanee reported this hadeeth in his <i>Kabeer</i> (6/164) and his <i>Sagheer</i> (1/104). Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278): &#8220;Its narrators are all of the standards of the Saheeh (collections), except Bakr Ibn Saleem, for he is reliable. Saleem Al-Hilaalee said in his checking of <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> (1/18): &#8220;Bakr Ibn Saleem is weak. However, he is used as a support during cases when hadeeth need to be backed up and supported. Al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) said in <i>At-Taqreeb</i>: &#8216;He is acceptable&#8217; meaning when a hadeeth needs to be supported. And if this is not the case, then he is layyin.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] This hadeeth is recorded by Imaam Ahmad, Al-Bazaar and Abu Ya’laa. Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id</i> (7/277): &#8220;Its narrators are the narrators of the standard of the Saheeh (collections).&#8221; Saleem Al-Hilaalee declared it saheeh in his <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Al-Haythamee (rahimahullaah) said in Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (7/278): &#8220;In its chain is Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and there is weakness in him.&#8221; The hadeeth can be found in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad (2/177). It is authentic due to its many paths of narration. Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;-us-Sagheer (no. 3291)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] A marfoo&#8217; hadeeth is a statement that has been reported by a companion, yet &#8220;raised&#8221; to the level of being a saying of the Prophet. A mawqoof hadeeth is a statement that is reported by a companion and &#8220;stopped&#8221;, meaning it ends up being only his statement, as opposed to being raised to a saying of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This hadeeth has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in mawqoof form, and by his son ‘Abdullaah in marfoo’ form. It can be found in <i>Az-Zuhd</i> (77149). The hadeeth is <i>da&#8217;eef</i> as has been clarified by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Saheeh Muslim (Eng.): vol. 4, no. 6853. What is meant by the remnants of the People of the Book are those who stuck to their religion upon truth without changing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This hadeeth has been reported from a number of different routes. Perhaps the one most similar to what the Shaikh (Ibn Rajab) is paraphrasing here is that which has been reported by At-Tabaraanee in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 724), in which the Prophet said: <b>&#8220;This ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in the Hellfire, except for one.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;And which is that sect?&#8221;</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;(The ones that adhere to) That which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</b> In another narration on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, the Prophet,<i> sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Every one of them will be in the Hellfire, except one and it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> And in another narration on the authority of Abu Sufyaan, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>: <b>&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, stood amongst us one day and said: &#8216;Indeed those before you from the People of the Book divided into seventy-two groups. And, indeed, this group (Muslims) will divide into seventy-three. Seventy-two groups will be in the Fire and one of them will be in Paradise. And it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.’&#8221; </b>This latter hadeeth was reported by Ahmad, Al-Haakim, Abu Dawood and others. Al-Haakim authenticated it and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. At-Tirmidhee (no. 2641) also reported a similar hadeeth to it and graded it saheeh. Imaam Al-Albaanee listed all its paths of narrations and different wordings in his <i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 204) and clarified that it is an authentic hadeeth without any doubt about its authenticity. In summary, the hadeeth and its additions are hasan due to its various paths of narrations, which serve as supporting evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] He means by this: We will praise Him, thank Him and ask Him for an increase in His Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Saheeh Muslim (no. 2962) and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3996)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (Eng.): vol. 5, no. 351</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Refer to <i>Al-Bidaayah-wan-Nihaayah</i> (7/70) of Ibn Katheer for an account of the event. It is recorded in his book under the section of the Battle of Jaloolaa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Imaam Ahmad (4/423) and others reported this hadeeth. Al-Manaawee said that it had a good chain in his book <i>Al-Jaami’-ul-Azhar</i> (1/146). Al-Albaanee graded it saheeh in his checking of <i>At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</i> (no. 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (4/252), Saheeh Muslim (no. 170), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (4/504), and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3952)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Shar<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-U<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Explained by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah<br />
Below are the Excerpts from Transcribed Audio</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion through him and the proof is His saying, He the Most High: <span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong><sup>[68]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span></em><em>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> did not pass away until after Allaah had completed the religion and the favour through him and had sent down to him His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> came down to the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> whilst he was performing the standing in <em>`Arafah</em> during the Farewell Hajj on the Day of <em>Jumu`ah</em>. And he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> lived after it for a short time and then moved on to the highest company (of angels).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he left his nation upon <strong><em>al-ma<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ajjah al-baydaa</em> (the clear white path)</strong> whose night is the same as its day; no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains a testimony from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that this religion is complete and that it covers everything of benefit to the servants and that it contains a solution for all of their issues and problems until the Establishment of the Hour. And that is suitable for every time and place; they do not need any other legislation after it or any other book to come down or any other messenger to be sent after the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>.<strong>           </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is no matter to be found and there is no event that will occur until the Day of Resurrection except that in the Legislation revealed to Muhammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> there is a solution for it and the ruling concerning it. However, the matter relates back to who is competent to extract evidence and to derive proof, rulings and issues. If there are to be found <em>ahlul-`ilm</em> (people of knowledge) and people qualified to make <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal deductions in rulings) who fulfill the conditions of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then indeed, this legislation is complete and contains a solution for all problems. Deficiency only comes about from us from the aspect of deficiency in (our) knowledge and inability to fully understand what Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has sent down &#8211; or from the aspect of desires, that there occurs a case of following of desires which diverts a person away from the Truth. Otherwise this religion is fully suitable and comprehensive and complete. Allaah has sufficed the <em>Islaamic</em> nation with it until the establishment of the hour if it acts upon it (the religion) correctly and refers back to it in its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>So if you disagree about anything then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger</strong>.»</span> <strong>[4:59]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring back to Allaah is to refer back to the Book of Allaah, and referring back to the Messenger after his passing away is to refer back to his <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">« <strong>And whatever you disagree about then its judgment is to be referred to Allaah</strong>.»</span><strong> [42:10]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of those who make accusations against the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of its having shortcomings or of its being deficient, (these accusations coming) from the atheists and the evil heretics, or from the “semi students” whose understanding falls short in being able to understand the hidden wisdoms of the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation. Therefore, these (foolish people) ascribe deficiency to the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation and they do not know that the deficiency is with themselves alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (this <em>aayah</em>) contains a refutation against those who accuse the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of deficiency and that it does not cover all needs of the servants and all matters of welfare of the servants until the Establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or those who say: &#8220;It was specific to a certain olden times,&#8221; &#8211; because there are many ignorant people who, when it is said to them, &#8220;This is the <em>Islaamic</em> ruling,&#8221; they say, &#8220;That was in the time of the Messenger and the initial time. As for now, conditions have changed and the matters have altered; and the legislated rulings were for people who have now passed away and for problems that have come to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say this, and this is disbelief in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it is a denial of His Saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion for this nation until the Hour is established for every time and place and for every generation of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also contains a refutation of the innovators, those who introduce worship from themselves and ascribe it to the religion, when it has no proof from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Rather they just introduce it in accordance with what they deem to be good or based upon blindly following others whom they have good thoughts about from the people of false ideas and people with their own goals and desires. So therefore, they introduce worship into the religion, which Allaah has sent down no proof for. He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected</strong>.»</span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alaihi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ss</span>alaatuwasallaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>And beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance</strong>.»</span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever introduces acts of worship which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor from the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah, then he is accusing this religion of not being complete and he wishes to complete the religion himself. He is not actually acknowledging the fact that Allaah has completed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever was not religion in the time of the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> will never be religion after him. So this contains a refutation of these groups: The group who say that <em>Islaam</em> is not suitable for every time, or those who innovate newly invented innovations which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and who ascribe them to the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of them because the religion was completed by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So there is no scope for addition in it nor for reduction from it. And there is no scope for raising doubts nor seeking to obscure the issue by saying that it is not suitable for the people in these later times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He is the Most Truthful One of those who speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>And I perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong>.»</span> <strong>[5:3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the last of that which came down to the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> and it is a testimony from the Lord of the whole of the Creation for this religion that it is complete, comprehensive, and fully suitable for every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying (in this <em>aayah</em>) is an address to this nation, from the first of it to the last of it, and it is not just an address to the first generation alone. Rather it is an address to the whole of the nation until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus), the whole nation are agreed in consensus that he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> passed away. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those say that the Messenger did not die. They negate death from the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. This is baseless speech and speech which is clearly rejected. It is refuted by what has been experienced and what is clearly the case, for the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> indeed passed away amongst his Companions. He was bathed, shrouded, had the funeral prayer prayed over him and he was buried. Can these actions be carried out on a person who is still alive?  He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was treated as one who had died. He was washed and shrouded and prayed over and then he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was buried in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regards to His Creation. And then where are the Messengers who came before him? What occurred to him occurred to the Messengers before him. They died. And he is one of them, so he died. This is by consensus of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who seek to attach themselves to the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> and seek deliverance through him besides Allaah, and say: &#8220;He is still alive.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the one that listens to the cassette tapes of Ahl-ul-Bid&#8217;ah or reads their books in order to know what they believe fall into sitting with innovators?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is as sitting with them or maybe even worse. But if he is learned and armed with knowledge and listens to them or reads their books to refute them and warn against them, it is okay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, were he not to have knowledge and insight and wants to read them or listen to them, it is not allowed. It will get stuck into his head and he has nothing to repel it with. It is not allowed for him to listen to them if he cannot defend himself against these poisons and evilnesses.</p>

<p>Leaving the correct path occurs in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>first </strong>is one who leaves the correct path but only intends good
<ul>
<li>He did not seek knowledge from the correct place and is heading for destruction</li>
<li>Following him in his error knowingly is a path leading to destruction</li>
<li>He should be advised privately (if he is not calling to his error)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>second</strong> one leaves the correct path deliberately, obstinately and knowing the Truth
<ul>
<li>He wishes to mislead the people and he is a devil</li>
<li>The devil misleads people from the Straight Path (<em>aayah</em> and hadeeth mentioned as proof)</li>
<li>It is obligatory to warn against this person otherwise he will fool the people</li>
<li>This is the role of the knowledge-based refutations, <em>rudood</em></li>
<li>Clarifying the Truth is a trust and responsibility Allaah placed upon the scholars</li>
<li>Remaining silent about those who mislead the people is hiding the Truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:left;">Audio Clip Courtesy : Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>In the lecture titled:</strong> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/01/07/the-danger-of-isis-upon-the-muslim-ummah-shaykh-muhammad-bin-ramzaan-al-haajiree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Danger of ISIS upon the Muslim Ummah &#8211; 11-03-1436 &#8211; Riyadh &#8211; Shaykh Muhammad bin Ramzaan al-Haajiree</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) told us a story of a young man.  He was a person who was involved in sinning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Normally when a person lives a life like this as soon as be becomes religious, if he lived previously in sin he wants to find the shortest or quickest path to Paradise.  And this individual arrived and sat in their localities.  He was their in their gatherings for 14 day.  One of the big players from them approached him and said:  &#8216;<strong>Ma shaa Allah, Allah has chosen you for a mission to go and blow yourself up</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8216;What?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The big player said: &#8216;We&#8217;ll put an explosive vest and you will go in the midst of these people and blow yourself up killing the kuffar and the apostates.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  They make takfeer for everything!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said:  &#8216;I want Jihaad, I want to fight. I shoot them they shoot me, back and forth, we trade fire, this is what I want.  Blowing myself up…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response of the big player was:  &#8216;Allah has chosen you to be a martyr for shahadah (martyrdom)!&#8217;<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8216;I just came, 14 days.&#8217;  He then asked the big player:  &#8216;How long have you been in Jihaad for?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response of the big player was:  &#8216;I have been in Jihaad for 14 years, when the Americans first came in to Iraaq…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said: &#8217;14 years and Allah hasn’t chosen you and 14 days and Allah has chosen me…&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the leader saw the response of this young man in front of everybody. He said: &#8216;OK, the affair goes back to you, but we are going to consult amongst us and we will give you the final answer at Maghrib time.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual he recants after he escaped from them.  He knew that the Maghrib time meant that they were going to kill him at Maghrib time.  They would say that you have apostated from Islam and kill him like this. Simple as that!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  &#8216;Cold blooded murder!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said: &#8216;This young man saw them previously saw that they did this to some of the young men there.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This individual said:  &#8216;I&#8217;m dead either way.  If I waited till Maghrib I&#8217;m dead. If I die on the way trying to escape, either way I am going to die!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he found an individual who knew somebody that he knew and this individual understood his circumstances and made easy for him an escape route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (حفظه الله تعالى) said:  &#8216;And of course he had no paperwork, because when he came he came as a mujahid wanting Paradise so he ripped up all of his paperwork.  Once he reached the border with Turkey, there were individuals who came from the Saudi Embassy and spoke to this individual and now he is being advised…&#8217;<strong> </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on some people who say: &#8220;O Allah, I worship You out of my love for You. If I worship You fearing Your Hell, let me enter it and if I worship You seeking to enter Your Paradise, let me enter Your Hell&#8221;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Worshiping Allah just by loving Him is the Manhaj (methodology) of misguided Sufis, which is of their own invention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loving Allah is the highest degree of Ibadah (worship), but not the sole act of Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Manhaj of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) is to worship Allah through love, fear, hope and other expressive forms of `Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord withhumility and in secret</strong></span>.&#8221; [Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about His Prophets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.&#8221;</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"> [</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about the angels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they stand in awe for fear of Him.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 28]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) elaborating on this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 62:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As regard those who bequeath that the Faatihah be recited on behalf of the Prophet’s soul, or on his behalf by the Prophet’s grave?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not binding to execute this bequest, because it is a bequest of an unprescribed matter. For the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) does not prescribe for anyone to worship Allaah and then dedicate the reward of worship to the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam). Since, had this been prescribed, then the companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, would have been the most preceding people in attaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also because the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is in no need for this. For indeed there is no person who does a righteous deed except that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) would have a similar reward. Because he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is the one who has directed to this, and, [as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said]: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who guides to what is good is like the one who does it.”</span></strong> [92] So, this bequest is from the <strong>foolish</strong> and <strong>futile</strong> actions as well as a <strong>bid’ah</strong>, something which has not been reported from the righteous predecessors, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And similarly if he said: “Recite the Faatihah on my behalf by the Prophet’s grave,” then it is not binding to fulfill this bequest. The reason for this is that <strong>specifying a particular place for a particular worship not prescribed by the sharia, is from the bida’</strong> as it is known in the aforementioned discussion pertaining to the issue of “Pursuance of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).” [93] And that the following of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) cannot be achieved until the act of worship agrees with the Sharee’ah in six matters: <strong>cause, type, extent, manner, time, and place</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Reported by at-Tirmithee (no.2672, Arabic). And also in saheeh Muslim: “One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer”, vol.3, no.4665.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; A note concerning a false report circulated by some ignorant people</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah. May Allah&#8217;s Blessings and Peace be upon the slave and Messenger of Allah, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have come across a false report that is being disseminated by some ignorant people who have little understanding of the religion of Allah.<b> The text of this report is as follows:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><b> </b><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace and blessings be upon the noblest of the messengers, our Master Muhammad (peace be upon him), and upon his family and Companions! Allah (Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#993300;" title="Surah Yunus, 10: 62" target="_blank" name="Nodoubt!Verily,theAuliy%C3%A2%E2%80%99of"></a><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> Allah is Most Truthful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">My Muslim brother, my Muslim sister. A thirteen-year-old girl was inflicted with hard illness and the doctor failed to treat her. One night her sickness grew worse and she wept until sleep overtook her. In her dream, she saw Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her). She put some drops in her mouth, and when she woke up she was completely healed from her sickness. Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) asked her to write this story thirteen times and distribute it to the Muslims to demonstrate the power of the Creator, may He be Exalted, and how it is manifested in His signs and His creation, Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him. The girl did what she was asked to do, and this is what happened:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>1 – The first copy </b>fell into the hands of a poor man, who wrote it out and distributed it. Thirteen days later, the Lord willed that this poor man should become rich.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>2 – The second copy </b>fell into the hands of a worker who ignored it. Thirteen days later he lost his job.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>3 – The third copy </b>fell into the hands of a rich man, who refused to write it out. Thirteen days later, he lost all the riches that he possessed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">Hasten, O Muslim brother or sister, after reading this story, to copy it out thirteen times and distribute it to people, so that you may get what you wish for from the Most Generous Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon our Master Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read this false report, I thought it is necessary to point out that the benefits and good things that the author claims will come to those who copy and distribute it, and the bad things that will happen to those who ignore it and do not disseminate it further, are all lies and baseless. Rather, they are fabrications of the liars and charlatans. They want to divert the Muslims from putting their trust in their Lord alone, with no partner or associate, to bring them benefits and ward off harm, as well as taking the permissible means as prescribed in the Shari`ah (Islamic law). They also want them to put their trust in someone or something other than Allah to bring benefits and ward off harm and to take false means that are not permitted or prescribed in the Shari`ah, which lead them to become attached to something other than Allah and to worship someone other than Him. Undoubtedly, this is one of the plots of the enemies against the Muslims, who want to divert them away from their true Din (religion) of Islam by any means possible. The Muslims should beware of these plots and not be deceived by them. The Muslim should pay no attention to this false report and similar reports which appear from time to time. Warnings have been issued about several of them in the past. It is not permissible for a Muslim to copy out this and similar reports, or to distribute them under any circumstances. Rather, doing so is an evil action and a person who does that is committing a sin; there is the fear that he will be punished in this world and in the Hereafter, because this isBid`ah (innovation in religion) whose evil is great and whose punishment is severe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is a kind of reprehensible Bid`ah and is one of the means that lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and overestimation of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family) and others among the dead; calling upon them instead of Allah, seeking their help, and thinking that they can bring benefit or ward off harm from those who call upon them and seek their help. It is also a kind of telling lies about Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 105" target="_blank" name="Itisonlythosewhobelievenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who believe not in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars</span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Hewhoinnovatesthingsinour"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="18424" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span></span> (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims who receive this letter should tear it up, destroy it, warn people against it and pay no attention to any promises or warnings that it may contain, because these are false reports that have no sound basis and nothing good or bad will result from it. But the one who invents it, those who copy it out and distribute it, and those who promote it and disseminate it among the Muslims are all sinful, because all of that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression which Allah has forbidden in His Book, where He (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and sound from all evil. Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the best to deal with those who fabricated this report and similar reports, and introduced into the religion of Allah things that have nothing to do with it. We ask Allah to deal with them as they deserve, for telling lies about Allah, disseminating falsehood, calling people to the means that lead to Shirk and exaggeration about the dead and distracting them with something that will harm them and will not benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity towards Allah and His slaves demands that we point this out. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.      From Yahya bin Saeed al-Qattaan (d. 198 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not look at the Hadeeth, but look at the <em>Isnaad</em> to see if the <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, otherwise do not be deceived by the Hadeeth if the <em>Isnaad</em> is not authentic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 9/188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2.      From Umar bin AbdulAzeez (d. around 100 A.H.) that he wrote to some people:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">4.      From Uthmaan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man came to Maalik and asked him about an issue.  So Maalik said to him: ‘The Messenger of <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said such and such’.  The man said to him ‘Do you hold that view?’ Imam Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah) </em>(among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah</em> befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&gt;&gt; [Noor: 63]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’  6/326]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5.      From Maalik ibn  Anas (d. 179 A.H.)  who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> established <em>Sunnan</em>, following them is following the Book of Allaah, and it is completion of obedience to Allaah, and strength upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah.  It is not permissible for anyone to change it, nor to look into that which opposes the Sunnah.  Whosoever seeks guidance by it, then he is guided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 8/98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6.      From Yahya bin Yahya at-Tameemi (d. 226 A.H.) who said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 8/537]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7.      From ar-Rabia’ who said: ‘I heard Shaafi’ee saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If you find in my book that which opposes the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, then take the Sunnah and leave that which I said.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">8.      From Maalik ibn  Anas (d. 179 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I am a human, I can make mistakes, and I can be correct, so look into my opinion, everything that is in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah, then take it, and everything that does not agree with the Book and the Sunnah then leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia’ Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/775]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9.      From Sufyan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Learn a lot of Ahadeeth, indeed they are weapons.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’  6/362]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10.  Abul Hasan Shabwayhi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever wants knowledge about the grave then he should adhere to the <em>Athaar</em>, and whoever wants knowledge of bread then he should adhere to opinions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Tooba</em> (a tree in Paradise) is for the one who looks at his own shortcomings rather than the shortcomings of others.  <em>Tooba</em> is for the one who humbles himself for Allaah without degrading himself. May Allaah have Mercy on the people of humility and servitude. He gives charity for the wealth gathered in a <em>Halaal</em> way and sits with the people of knowledge and gentleness and wisdom, and the Sunnah is sufficient for him and does not transgress to <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>

Yes I take this, and that is obligatory for me, and upon everyone who hears it. Indeed Allaah chose Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from the people and guided them by him, and upon his hands, so it is upon the creation to follow him, the obedient ones or the disobedient ones, there is no exit for the Muslim from this.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam ash- Shaafi’ee trembled, shuddered and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which sky will shade me and which earth will carry me if I narrate a Hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and say an opinion other than that of the Hadeeth.’ And he said: ‘If you find a Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then follow it and do not turn to the saying of anyone.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’ 9/107 ]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Jamia akhlaaq ar-Rawee’ 1/142 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19- From al-Hasan (d.110 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Acting upon a little of the Sunnah is better than acting upon a lot of <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Shu’ab al-Eemaan’ 7/952 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20- From Sa’eed bin al-Musayib (d. 93 A.H.) who said that he saw a man doing a lot of<em>Ruku</em> and <em>Sujood</em> [praying a lot of optional prayers] after the <em>Fajr</em> prayer, so he prohibited him from it.  So the man said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, will Allaah punish me for the prayer?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No, but for opposing the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘at-Tamheed’ 20/104 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21- From AbdurRahman bin Mahdi (d. 198 A.H.) that a group of the Ahl-ul-Bida’ were mentioned in front of him and their striving in worship, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah will not accept except that which is upon the Deen and the Sunnah, then he recited: &lt;&lt; But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them&gt;&gt; [Hadeed: 27]  So Allaah did not accept that from them and he reprimanded them about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’ 9/8 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22- From Jafar bin Ahmed bin Sinan (d. 307 A.H.) who said: ‘I heard my father saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is not a <em>Mubtadi’</em> except that he hates the companions of Hadeeth.  And if a man innovates a <em>Bida’</em> then the sweetness of the Hadeeth is torn out from his heart.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 12/245]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23- From Sufyaan ibn Sa’eed ath-Thawri  (d. 161 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Bida’</em> is more beloved to Iblees (<em>Shaytaan</em>) than sinning.  One repents from sinning, and one does not repent from <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahl-us-Sunnah’ al –Laalkaee 132 ]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">From the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Muhaddith</em>, Shaykh, <em>Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Concerning Boycotting the People of <em>Bida’<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part One</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>The Issue of giving Advice before Spreading a Refutation</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What branches off from this[previous question: mentioning the good deeds of an individual while refuting him] is the statement of some of the people or more correctly should I say, the condition set by some of the people who say that in the case of refutations it’s necessary before it being printed, that a copy is sent to the one being refuted so that they can look into it.  They say that this is from the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Salaf?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is not a condition, however if it’s easy to do, and it is hoped from this practice to bring that person closer without making the case well-known between the people, then there is no doubt that this matter is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for firstly making it a condition, and then secondly making it a general condition then this is not at all from wisdom in any circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people, as you all know, are of different natures, like the natures of gold and silver.  So the one whom you know from him that he is with us on the path and methodology and that he would accept the advice, wherein you can at least write to him without making his mistake public as you see it, then this is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this is not a condition, even if this was a condition it’s not a possible matter, where can you get that person’s address? How can you contact him? Then, will you get a response from him or not? These are matters which are absolutely speculative.. . . . implementing this condition is very difficult, that is why this point is not conditional.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the cassette entitled: ‘al-Muwwazanaat Fee Naqd’ Side A from the ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.638]</p>
<h2 id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled" style="text-align:justify;"> Part Two</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Making (Hajr) Boycotting the Ahl-ul-Bida’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Questioner: Regarding what is connected to boycotting the <em>Mubtadi’</em> (person of<em>Bida’</em>) O Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Go ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: What appears from what I heard is that you have a regard for the benefit of the <em>Mubtadi’</em> himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: And you do not reject the principle of boycotting?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: I do not deny the principle of <em>Hajr</em>, this is obligatory, this <em>Hajr</em> is. .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: O Shaykh as you notice we see the opinion of the impermissibility of the<em>Hajr</em> of the <em>Mubtadi’</em> – we take into consideration the benefit for this <em>Mubtadi’</em>.  Do we not see the general benefit for those who might become misguided due his effecting them, then there’s another thing…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Leave the other issue until we’ve looked into the first issue.  This issue in reality my brother, from a practical view needs precise knowledge and precise practical action, so just now you gave an example of a scholar who mixes with a <em>Mubtadi’</em> and the general people think that there is good in this <em>Mubtadi’</em>, do you view this scholar as one who flatters people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: Okay, so if you view the opposite of this, as I hoped then it is possible for me to say, that you hold the opinion, that this scholar criticizes them for this <em>Bida’</em>[they practice], he advises them, and he admonishes them.  So if this is the case, then from where will the danger come to the general people when they hear him, when he advises them and reminds them etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: So this danger which you notice and indicate towards is regarding the one who flatters people and not regarding the one who criticizes the <em>Bida’</em>, this is also better, so there is a difference between one scholar and another scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: May Allaah reward you with good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: I mean, in other words, the one who goes along with them and remains quiet about their <em>Bida’</em> and their misguidance and is over-looking, then we criticize this and it is necessary to make it clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=363847]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part Three</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Is it permissible to defame a companion of Bida’ or to speak against him and criticize him?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <em>Bida’</em> are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either he conceals it to himself – or he is well known amongst the people. As for the first instance then there is no need to make it well know, because his misguidance is limited to his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other type then it is necessary to defame him and warn against him, so that the people who live amongst him are not deceived by him; And this is not backbiting at all – like some of the obstinate ones presume – and the hadeeth Of Backbiting: ‘you mentioning about your brother that which he dislikes to be mentioned’  this hadeeth is from those that are general and which is specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have mentioned to you the saying of some of the Scholars in two lines of poetry, which gathers the type of backbiting which is exempted from being <em>Haram</em>, so they say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">القدح ليس بغيبةٍ في ستةٍ ……….متظلم ومعرِّفٍ ومحذرٍ<br />
ومجاهر فِسقاً ومستفتٍ ومـن…… طلب الإعانة في إزالة منكر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Defamation is not backbiting regarding six types of people**</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The oppressed and for <em>recognition</em> and the one warned against***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who openly sins and the one who necessitates a verdict***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who seeks aid in removing an evil***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mutathalumin : being oppressed – Mua’arafin: recognition – Muhadeerin: Warning against Mujahir fisqan : One who openly sins – Mustaftin : Inquiring a fatwaa</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Istee’ana fee Ezzalatin Munkarin : seeking assistance in changing the evil</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So defaming the <em>Mubtadi’</em> enters into this definition and it also enters into warning against him; this is why the Scholars of hadeeth –May Allaah reward them with goodness-  are agreed upon characterizing many of the narrators of hadeeth with what they had innovated into the <em>Deen</em>. The scholars of hadeeth mention all of this due to them standing up with the obligation of clarifying it for the people; So that it would be known who is the strong narrator and his ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> is accepted. The narrator who is a<em>Mubtadi’</em> is abandoned along with his deviated ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from an audio clip :  <a href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=353601">http://www.sahab.net/forums/showthread.php?t=353601</a>]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Bida’</em> by which a person would be counted as from the <em>Ahl-ul-Ahwa</em> (the people who follow desires) is that which is well known by the people of knowledge of the Sunnah in it opposing the Book and the Sunnah; such as the <em>Bida’</em> of the Khawarij[1], Rawafidah[2], al-Qadareeyah[3] and the Murjiah[4].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 35/414]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever opposes the clear Book, and the elaborate Sunnah or that which the Salaf of the <em>Ummah</em> held a consensus about, and this opposition is without a valid reason, then this person is dealt in the same manner in which the People of <em>Bida’</em> are dealt with.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 35/414]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever worshipped with an act of worship which is not obligatory nor recommended, and he believed that it was obligatory or recommended, then he is a misguided<em>Mubtada’</em>, and this is an evil <em>Bida’</em> not a good <em>Bida’</em>, and the imams of the <em>Deen</em> are in agreement about this, since Allaah is not worshipped except with that which is obligatory or recommended.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 1/160]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Distinction Between a Bida’ and Ijtihad</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And many from those of the Salaf and those who of the consecutive generations said and acted upon that which is a <em>Bida’</em> and they were not aware that it was a <em>Bida</em>’, either due to a weak hadeeth which they thought was authentic, or due to what they understood of the <em>Ayaat</em> which were not the intent of the <em>Ayaat</em>, or due to an opinion that they held in an issue where the text did not reach them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 19/191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the one whose sin is hidden or performs a <em>Bida’</em> in secret, that <em>Bida’</em> does not take a person outside of Islaam, and this person is not made <em>Hijra</em> (boycotted) from, on the contrary the person who is made <em>Hijra</em> from is the one who calls to <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Majmoo’ al-Fatawa Ibn Taymeeyah’ 24/175]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Question: Which <em>Bida’</em> is it by which a person is counted as being outside the circle of<em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamma’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Bida’</em> such as of <em>al-Qadr</em>[5], <em>Bida’</em> of <em>al-Irjaa</em>[6], <em>Bida’</em> of <em>ar-Rafd</em>[7], <em>Bida’</em> of<em>Kharooj</em>[8], and the Soofeeyah <em>Bida’</em> such as the <em>Mawlid</em>[9] which has <em>Shirk</em> and any other types of <em>Mawlid</em>.  Making journeys to graves and other types of <em>Bida’</em> which are similar to this – may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In having loyalty to the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> a person becomes from amongst them, and likewise if he aids them and defends them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘Indeed some people sit with the people of <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad bin Hanbal said: ‘Advise him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person said: ‘But he rejected the advice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: ‘Count him from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who sits with the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> and associates himself with them then conclude from him that he is sick and that he is in agreement with these people, and regarding this point there are evidences, from them the saying of the Messenger :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The souls are enlisted soldiers, those who become familiar with each other, associate with one another, and those who oppose each other, differ.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person who associates himself and becomes familiar with <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> then it is evident that there is an agreement and similarity between the matters, the two people and the two groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To clarify, what we have mentioned is concerning the one who leaves the circle of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamma’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Fatawa Fadeelata Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee’ 14/153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: What are the rulings concerning the people of <em>Bida’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed these people are divided into those who are <em>Du’waat</em> (callers to <em>Bida’</em>) and those who do not call to <em>Bida’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who call to <em>Bida’</em>, then these people can be given punishments which have been mentioned by the Imams of Islaam. From these punishments are banishment, just as Umar banished Sabeeg and others. Also from those punishments, are capital punishment, like they killed al-Ja’ad bin Dirham and al-Halaaj and others from the leaders of <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their followers: then these are guided and it is explained to them and they are called to Allaah with wisdom and good exhortation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Fatawa Fadeelata Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee’ 14/155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee’ al-Madkhalee wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>When is a man treated as <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘If the scholars of the Companions and those who followed them and those after them differed in a matter then they would follow the command of Allaah in His saying:  &lt;&lt;  (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination. &gt;&gt; [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they would debate an issue, in a consultative, advising manner. And perhaps they would differ in a knowledge based practical issue, yet, they would maintain their friendship and practice restrain to aid brotherhood in the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever opposes the clear Book, and the elaborate Sunnah or that which the Salaf of the <em>Ummah</em> held a consensus about, and the opposition is without excuse, then this person is dealt in the same manner as the People of <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Abi Zayed al-Qayrawani (386) in his book ‘al- Jamia’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And there is a saying of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em>: that this person (of the people of <em>Bida’</em>) is not excused, because his <em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) attracted him to <em>Bida’</em>; because the Khawarij made <em>Ijtihad</em> in interpreting, yet they were not excused. Their (erroneous) interpretation caused them to rebel against the Companions. The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> labeled them as those that exited from the<em>Deen</em>. But as for <em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> made it such that the <em>Mujtahid</em> (the person who derives a ruling) in rulings is rewarded even if he made a mistake in that ruling.’</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2005 – ‘Indeed there people who read the Qur’aan, but it does not go pass their throats, they leave Islaam just like the arrow leaves the prey.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by ad-Darmi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Amroo bin Salamah:  We were sitting by the door of Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood before lunch, so that if he came out, we could walk with him to the <em>Masjid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree came and said: Has Abu Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sat down with us, waiting for him to come out, and when he came out, we all gathered towards him, and Abu Moosaa said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! Previously I saw something in the <em>Masjid</em> which I disliked. But,<em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, what I saw, was nothing but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: What was it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa said, ‘If you live, you will see it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Moosaa said, ‘I saw a group of people, sitting in circles waiting for the prayer.  In every circle there was a man and in their hands were small stones and he would say: ‘Say <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ 100 times.  Then, he would say, ‘Say <em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em>’ 100 times and he would say, ‘Say <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times and they would say ‘<em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said, ‘So what did you say to them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I did not say anything to them, rather I waited for your opinion [or ‘I waited for your command’].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Why did you not command them to count their bad deeds [i.e. seek forgiveness from your deeds] and guarantee them that their good deeds would not be lost?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walked and we walked with him until he reached one of those circles and he stood there and said, ‘What is this that I see you doing?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! These are nothing but small stones with which we are counting, saying ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Count your sins; I guarantee that you will not lose anything of your good deeds!  Beware, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad!  How quick you are to your destruction!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we are, the Companions of your Prophet – abundant, everywhere and here is his clothing which has not been [wasted away] and his utensils have not been broken. I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, <strong>either you are an <em>Ummah</em> more rightly-guided than the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad or you are opening the door of misguidance.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; ‘We swear by Allaah, O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘How many people intend good but never achieve it.  Verily the Messenger of Allaah – narrated to us, ‘Indeed there will be a people who read the Qur’aan but it does not pass beyond their throats.’  I swear by Allaah, I do not know. Perhaps most of them are from amongst you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amroo bin Salamah said, ‘We saw some of those sitting in those circles fighting on the Day of <em>Nahrawaan</em>, along with the Khawaarij.’<strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani mentions in the <em>Takreej</em> (research) of the above narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed there is a lesson to be learnt from this narration, for those who follow <em>Sufi</em>paths and <em>Dhikr</em> gatherings which are against the Sunnah.  When someone forbids an evil action that they perform they accuse him of forbidding <em>Dhikr</em> from its very foundation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>Kufr</em> which no Muslim in this world should fall into; the evil action which they adhere to, from those forms of <em>Dhikr</em> and gatherings which, were not legislated at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, otherwise why would Ibn Masood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> disapprove of those who were sitting in their gatherings?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not, a gathering done on a specific day, and doing an amount of <em>Dhikr</em> which is not indicated by the <em>Sharia’</em> but is listed by the <em>Shaykh</em> of the gathering, and he commands them with the amount of <em>Dhikr</em> that they should do from himself, as if he is a legislator on behalf of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  Or do they have partners with Allaah, who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt;[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To add to this, the Sunnah which is established by the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> verbally and practically is to perform the <em>Tasbeeh</em> (remembrance of Allaah) on your fingertips, as it is clear in ‘The refutation against al-Habshee’ and in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits which can be reaped from the hadeeth and this story is; that the importance is not of performing a large amount of worship, but rather, is it according to the Sunnah and far away from <em>Bida’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Masood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> also indicated to this point in his saying: ‘sticking to the Sunnah is better than striving in <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another benefit is: that a small <em>Bida’</em> leads to a greater <em>Bida’</em>.  Do you not see that those people from these gatherings afterwards became from the Khawaarij who were killed by the rightly guided <em>Khalifah</em> ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib?  So is there anyone who will take heed?!’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">From the Works of The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong># Principles of Bida’ 1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Adhering to general texts which have not been implemented\acted upon is not from the Fiqh of the Salaf.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhering to general texts which have not been acted upon, is not from the Fiqh(understanding) of the Salaf. Indeed every Bida’ which some people regard as being good, is generally taken from a general evidence.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Riyadh Saliheen’ researched by Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani p.136 H#250]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is not a condition in order to reject every individual Bida’ that we need a narration conveyed with an authentic chain from one of the Salaf.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said during his refutation of Shaykh Al-Habshi, in his debate with him regarding the Bida’ of prayer beads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘. . . . . And is it a condition with the people of knowledge and intellect in rejecting every individual Bida’ that we should have a narration conveyed with an authentic chain from one of the Salaf rejecting every single Bida’? This is not something a person who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge says.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘ar-Radd ‘ala Taqeeb al-Hatheeth’ by Shaykh Albaani p.54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Coming closer to Allaah Ta’ala cannot be done except with what Allaah has legislated.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas bin Malik who said: I was sitting with Ubayy and Abu Talha, and we had just eaten meat and bread, then I called for water to make Wudu. Ubayy and Abu Talha said to me: ‘Why are you making Wudu?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said: ‘Because of this food we just ate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Do you make Wudu because of good things (food)?! One who was better than you(the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>), did not make Wudu after eating.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, &amp; Albaani said its Isnad is Jayyid]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This Athar (narration) indicates that the Companions would reject coming closer to Allaah- Ta’ala- with an action which the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not legislate whether with statements or actions, as for Anas being concerned with making Wudu for eating meat, then perhaps the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> reached him: ‘Make Wudu for that meat which has been cooked on fire’, and it did not reach him that it had been abrogated and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: Mishkat 1\107 #329]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"># Principles of Bida’ 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Mubtadi’ is he who Exaggerates Worship.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasiruddeen Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one should presume that when we choose to limit ourselves to the Sunnah with regard to the amount of Rakat prayed during Taraweeh, and the impermissibility of increasing upon that, that we regard those from the preceding scholars and those who came after them as being misguided or that we see them as people of Bida’ because they don’t hold this opinion (of limiting to the Sunnah), as some of the people have presumed and believed that we see them as being misguided and they have then used that to justify attacking us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This presumption of theirs, necessitates clarity, they assume that just because a matter is not allowed then it is automatically regarded as a Bida’, or that just because everyone who says it is permissible or recommended to pray more [in the Taraweeh prayer] that he is a misguided Mubtadi! We say no, never, this presumption is indeed false, and extreme ignorance. Because the Bida’ which a person is criticized for and the Ahadeeeth which are applied in curbing Bida’ are a result of the definition: ‘An invented way of religion which is similar to the Sharia’ but is not from it, intending to follow that way and exaggerating in the worship of Allaah -Subhanahu.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever innovates a Bida’ and intends by it exaggeration in worship, and he knows it is not from the Sharia’, then he is the type of person upon whom these Ahadeeth are applied. As for the one who falls into Bida’ unknowingly, and he did not intended exaggeration in worship, then those Ahadeeth do not include these people at all, and they do not concern them at all, rather they concern those Mubtada’ who stand in the way of disseminating the Sunnah, and regard all Bida’ as good, without knowledge or guidance, nor a clear Book, not even blindly following the people of knowledge and remembrance, rather they do this following desires and satisfying the common folk!’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2823 – From AbdurRahmaan bin Jubair bin Nafeer, from his father who said: we were sitting with al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad one day, when a person passed by him and said: ‘<em>Toobah</em> (a tree in Paradise) for these two eyes which saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘I swear by Allaah that we wish we had seen what you have seen and witnessed what you witnessed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miqdad became angry, I became astonished, because they did not say anything but good. Then he turned to the man and said: ‘What makes a person wish that he was present when Allaah has made him absent.  He does not know, if he had witnessed it, how he would have been at that time? I swear by Allaah there were a people that were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who Allaah will throw on their nostrils in the Hell-Fire, because they did not respond to the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> nor did they believe in him. Do you not praise Allaah, for taking you out from your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything except your Lord and believing in that which your Prophet was sent with. Indeed you have been saved from trials by others being trialed instead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, that Allaah sent the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the severest time that any Prophet from among the Prophets was ever sent, in any period of time including the <em>Jahileeyah</em> time period (period of ignorance before Islaam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not regard any religion better than the worship of idols, then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came with the <em>Furqan</em> (the Criterion) he separated the truth from falsehood with this Criterion, and he separated a father from his son, so much so that a man would see his father and his son or his brother as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah opened the lock of his heart with <em>Eemaan</em>, and he knows if he is destroyed he enters the fire, it does not make him happy that his beloved is in the fire. And it is about those that Allaah –Azza wa Jal – said: &lt;&lt;And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of eyes&gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Al-Albaani declared the <em>Isnaad</em> to be Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani commented saying:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘(Notice): This separating mentioned in this hadeeth has a foundation in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Abdullaah who said: ‘The angels came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> while he was sleeping, some of them said: Indeed he is asleep and some of them said: ‘Indeed the eyes are asleep but the heart is awake…’ to the end of the hadeeth, and in this hadeeth it mentions: ‘So whoever obeys Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then he has obeyed Allaah, and whoever disobeys Muhammad then he disobeys Allaah, and Muhammad separated/divided the people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth is a clear proof that shows that separating/division is not blameworthy in itself. So, some of the people push the people away from the <em>Dawa’</em> to the Book and the Sunnah, and they regard warning against that which opposes the Book and the Sunnah as being from the innovated matters, or they claim that the time to call to the Book and the Sunnah has not arrived! Their claim is that the Book and the Sunnah pushes people away and divides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is great ignorance with regard to the truthful <em>Dawa’</em> and what is associated to this<em>Dawa’</em> from differences of opinions and hostility towards this <em>Dawa’</em>, as is witnessed in every time and place.  This is the Sunnah (the way) Allaah has ordained for His creation, and you will never find a change or turning off in the Sunnah (the way) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one <em>Ummah</em>, but they will not cease to disagree,- Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy &gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if giving advice is obligatory for general and specific religious interests: like regarding narrators of hadeeth who make mistakes and lie then like Yahya bin Sa’eed said: I asked Malik, Thawri, al-Laith bin Sa’ad – I think it was him – and al-Awza’ee about a man who is accused in hadeeth or he does not memorize hadeeth? They said: ‘Make clear his condition.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘I find it difficult to say about a person that he has such and such problem, and so and so is like such and such.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said: ‘If you remain silent and I remain silent when will an ignorant person know the authentic from the unauthentic?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the leaders of <em>Bida’</em> from the people who have statements that oppose the Book and the Sunnah, or worship which opposes the Book and the Sunnah, it is obligatory to clarify their condition and warn the <em>Ummah</em> against  them and this is in agreement with the Muslims.  So much so that it was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: Is a person who fasts, prays and makes <em>Itikaf</em> more beloved to you or speaking against the people of <em>Bida’</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If he fasts, prays and makes <em>Itikaf</em> then that is for himself, and if he speaks against the people of <em>Bida’</em> then that is for the Muslims and that is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that this benefit is general for all the Muslims for their religion and it is in the same class as <em>Jihad</em> in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the path of Allaah and His<em>Deen</em>, His <em>Minahij</em> (methodologies), His <em>Sharia’</em> and repelling the injustice of these people and their hostility upon this is  a general responsibility, which is something that is in agreement among the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not the case that Allaah made people in order to repel the harm of these people, the <em>Deen</em> would have become corrupted. The corruption of the <em>Deen</em> would be greater than the corruption caused by being conquered by the enemy at war. Since if these people take over they do not corrupt the hearts and what is in the heart is from the <em>Deen</em>, but they do it slowly, as for the People of <em>Bida’</em> then they corrupt the hearts from the onset.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from  ‘Majmoo fatawa’ 28/231-232]</p>

TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Chapter 15: The People of Innovations are worse than the People of Sins</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[134]</b> Abu Moosaa said: “That I live next to a Jew and a Christian, and monkeys and pigs, is more beloved to me than that if I were to live next to a follower of desires (i.e. deviant), who will spread disease to my heart.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[135]</b> Yoonus bin ‘Ubaid said to his son: “I forbid you from fornicating, stealing and drinking alcohol. But if you were to meet Allaah having committed these (sins), that would be more beloved (to me) than if you were to meet Him with the views of ‘Amr bin ‘Ubaid or the followers of ‘Amr.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[136]</b> Abul-Jawzaa said: “If the apes and the swine were to live with me in a house, that would be more beloved to me than if a person from Ahlul-Ahwaa (deviants) were to live with me. They have entered into the ayah: <b>‘And when they meet you they say: We believe. But when they are alone, they bite the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: Perish in your rage. Allaah knows what is in the hearts.’</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 119]” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[137]</b> Al-‘Awwaam bin Hawshab said about his son ‘Eesaa: “By Allaah, if I saw ‘Eesaa gathering with the people of musical instruments, alcohol and falsehood, that would be more beloved to me than if I were to see him sitting with the people of argumentation – the innovators.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[138]</b> Yahyaa bin ‘Ubaid said: “A man from the Mu’atazilah encountered me (one day), so I got up and said: “Either you pass on or I will pass on, for indeed if I were to walk with a Christian, that would be more loved to me than if I were to walk with you.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[139]</b> Arta’ Ibn al-Mundir said: “If my son were one of the sinful wicked people, that would be more beloved to me than if he were a Follower of Desires (i.e. a deviant).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[140]</b> Sa’eed bin Jubair said: “If my son were to keep the company of a sinning scoundrel upon the Sunnah that would be more beloved to me than if he were to accompany a worshipping innovator.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[141]</b> It was once said to Maalik bin Mughawal: “We saw your son playing with the birds.” So he responded: “How wonderful that it preoccupies him from accompanying an innovator.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[142]</b> Al-Barbahaaree said: “If you see a person whose manner and opinion is despicable, he is wicked, sinful, and oppressive, yet he is a person of the Sunnah, accompany him and sit with him, since his sin will not harm you. And if you see a man who strives hard and long in worship, is abstemious, being continual in worship, except that he is a person of innovation, do not sit with him, do not listen to his words, and do not walk along with him, since I do not feel safe that you will not eventually come to be pleased with his way and go to destruction along with him.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[143]</b> Abu Haatim said: “I heard Ahmad bin Sinaan said: “That a Tanboor player were to live next to me is more beloved to me than if an innovator were to live next to me. This is since I can forbid the Tanboor player and I can break the tanboor (a mandolin-like instrument). But as for the innovator, he corrupts the people, the neighbors and the youth.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[144]</b> Imam ash-Shaafi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “If the servant were to meet Allaah having committed every sin except Shirk, that would be better for him than if he were to meet Allaah with some deviant belief.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[145]</b> Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The graves of sinners from People of Sunnah is a garden, while the graves of the pious ascetics from the People of Innovation is a barren pit. The sinners among Ahlus-Sunnah are the Friends of Allaah, while the pious among Ahlul-Bid’ah are the Enemies of Allaah.” [12]</p>

<p>AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
SOURCE: His explanation of Lum&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad of Ibn Qudaamah (pg. 161-163)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are certain signs that indicate people of innovation, such as.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They attribute themselves to something other than Islaam and the Sunnah, due to what they have introduced from innovations in speech, action and belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They cling fanatically to their opinions and do not turn to the truth, even if it is clearly conveyed to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. They hate the scholars of Islaam and the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From their groups are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ar-Raafidah</span></b> &#8211; They are the ones who go to extremes with regard to the Members of the Household (<i>Aali Bait</i>). They declare the companions that opposed them as being disbelievers or they accuse them of evil (<i>fisq</i>). They are divided into many sects, among which are the extremists, who claim that &#8216;Alee is god, and among which are other than them. Their innovation first appeared during the Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib when &#8216;Abdullaah bin Saba&#8217; said to him: &#8220;You are God.&#8221; Due to this, &#8216;Alee commanded that they be set on fire. However, their leader, &#8216;Abdullaah bin Saba&#8217;, escaped to another city.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They hold various views concerning the Attributes of Allaah, so among them are those who perform<i>tashbeeh</i>, those who perform <i>ta&#8217;teel</i> and those who are in conformity (with the correct view of the attributes). They are called the Raafidah because they rejected (<i>rafd</i>) Zayd bin &#8216;Alee Ibnul-Husayn bin &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib, when they asked him about Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and so he said &#8220;<i>rahimahullaah</i>&#8221; for both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they rejected him and distanced themselves from him. And they named themselves Shee&#8217;ah because of their claim and notion that they are taking sides (<i>tashayu&#8217;</i>) with the <i>Aali Bait</i> and that they support them and that they are reclaiming their right to Imaamship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Al-Jahmiyyah</span></b> &#8211; They attribute themselves to Al-Jahm bin Safwaan who was killed by Saalim or Salim bin Ahwaz in the year 121H. Their views concerning the Attributes of Allaah are composed of<i>ta&#8217;teel</i> (denial) and <i>nafee</i> (negation). Concerning Al-Qadar, they hold the opinion that mankind is coerced to do deeds (<i>al-jabr</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their view concerning Eemaan is that of Irjaa, which means that they believe Eemaan is merely the confirmation of the heart, and that statements and actions are not part of Eemaan. So according to them, someone who commits a major sin is a believer with complete Eemaan (i.e. Eemaan does not increase or decrease). So they are the Mu&#8217;atazilah, Jabariyyah and Murji’ah all in one and they are divided into many sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Al-Khawaarij</span></b> &#8211; They are the ones who set out to kill &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) due to his rulership. Their methodology consists of freeing themselves from &#8216;Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and &#8216;Alee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), setting out against the Imaam if he opposes the Sunnah and declaring disbelief upon the one who commits a major sin. They believe that this type of person will remain in the Hellfire forever. They are divided into numerous groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Al-Qadariyyah</span></b> &#8211; Their methodology consists of negating Al-Qadar from the actions of the servant and that his desire and ability are independent from the Desire and Ability of Allaah. The first to manifest this view openly was Mu&#8217;bad Al-Juhnee, in the last part of the era of the Sahaabah. He learned it from a Majoosee man from Al-Basrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are divided into two groups, one that is extreme and one that is not extreme. The extremist group rejects the attributes of knowledge, desire, ability and creating from Allaah in favor of the actions of the servant. This type of people has now become extinct or close to it. Those that are not extreme believe that Allaah is knowledgeable of the actions of the servant. However, they reject its occurring by His desire, ability and creating. This is what their belief is founded upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Al-Murji&#8217;ah</span></b> &#8211; They believe that actions are deferred from Eemaan (Al-Irjaa). Thus actions, according to them, are not part of it. Eemaan is simply the complying of the heart. Thus the sinner, according to them, is a believer with complete Eemaan, even if he does what he does from the disobedient acts or he abandons what he abandons from the obedient acts. And if we ruled that someone that abandoned one of the commandments of the Religion is a disbeliever, then that would be due to the absence of the complying in his heart not due to his abandonment of that deed. These are the views of the Jahmiyyah. And it, along in comparison with the views of the Khawaarij, are the two opposite extremities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Al-Mu&#8217;atazilah</span></b> &#8211; They are the followers of Waasil bin Ataa&#8217;, who withdrew (<i>&#8216;Itizaal</i>) from the gathering of Al-Hasan Al-Basree. He determined that the sinner is in a level between two levels. Thus, he is neither a believer nor a disbeliever, yet he will reside eternally in the Hellfire. &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Ubaid followed him in that and their views concerning the Attributes of Allaah are based on <i>ta&#8217;teel</i>, like the Jahmiyyah, and concerning Al-Qadar, like that of the Qadariyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They reject the relation of the Qadaa and the Qadar of Allaah to the actions of the servant. In regards to the one who commits a major sin, they hold that he will remain in the Hellfire forever and that he is extracted from the fold of Eemaan into a level between the two levels of belief and disbelief. Thus they oppose the views of the Jahmiyyah in regards to these two principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Al-Karaamiyyah</span></b> &#8211; They are the followers of Muhammad bin Karaam, who died in 225H. They incline towards <i>tashbeeh</i> and hold the belief of Irjaa. They are further divided into numerous groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">As-Saalimah</span></b> &#8211; They are the followers of a man who was called Ibn Saalim. Their views consist of <i>tashbeeh</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the groups mentioned by the author. He then said &#8220;And those similar to them&#8221;, such as <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">the Ash&#8217;ariyyah</span></b>. They are the followers of Abul-Hasan &#8216;Alee bin Ismaa&#8217;eel Al-Ash&#8217;aree. At first, he inclined towards the views of the Mu&#8217;tazilah sect, until he reached forty years of age. Then he openly announced his repentance from that to the public and exposed the falsehood of the Mu&#8217;tazilah. So he took hold of the methodology of the Ahl-us-Sunnah, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who attribute themselves to him, they remained upon a specific methodology, which is known as the Ash&#8217;ariyyah sect. They do not confirm any of Allaah&#8217;s attributes, except seven, which they believe are proven by intellect. And they distort the meaning of the rest of them. The seven (they affirm) are the ones mentioned in this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;He is Living, Knowing, Able and has Speech<br />
Desire, and likewise Hearing and Seeing&#8221;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also commit other innovations with regard to the meaning of Speech, Al-Qadar and other than that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah fee Naqd ar-Rijaal wal Kutub wat-Tawaa&#8217;if</i>&#8221; (pg. 33-43 of 3rd Edition)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are guidelines, which define those whom we are required to respect and honor from among mankind, such that it is not permissible to harm their honor. And they define those whom it is permissible to speak about and criticize, rather, whom it is obligatory to criticize at the time of necessity and benefit, without having to mention their good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom we are obligated to honor</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The Messengers and Prophets, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon all of them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has related to us their stories, showing their striving and perseverance, while He has repudiated those who denied and opposed them. And He commanded the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) as well as his ummah to follow their example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: The Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing that the Muslim ummah should feel towards them except love and respect. Allaah has praised them highly in His Book. And He spoke about their high rank, their efforts and the sacrifices they made with their wealth and their lives in the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) praised them highly, both on an individual and a group level. This is such that the scholars of Islaam devoted special and close attention to their merits and qualities, writing many books concerning their virtues and special characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from insulting them, saying: <b>&#8220;Do not revile my Companions. For I swear by the One in whose hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give in charity the likes of mount Uhud in gold, it would not equal a mudd (handful using 2 hands) of one of them nor even half of it.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah are well aware of their position and status, and so they guard it with the strictest form of guarding. And they forbid others from speaking vainly about what occurred of dispute between &#8216;Alee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and Mu&#8217;awiyah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and those who supported them from the rest of the Companions. Rather, they assert for them the reward that is given to the <i>mujtahids</i>. And they ruled that all those who spoke about them – or even about one of them – were upon deviance, misguidance and heresy.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: Those who followed them in goodness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes those who reached the (time of the) Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and were guided by their guidance, such as the seven scholars of Fiqh of Madeenah and those who followed their way in the rest of the towns. Then after them, are the scholars of Hadeeth, Fiqh and Tafseer – those who strove upon the way of the righteous Companions and Successors. And it includes those who followed their methodology with regard to Creed, holding tightly onto the Book and the Sunnah, avoiding innovations, vain desires and its adherents, and defending the truth and its adherents, up until this day of ours and after it, until Allaah&#8217;s promise comes about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was referring to when he said: <b>&#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah, triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them nor will those who oppose them, until the order (promise) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, comes.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are better known as Ahl-ul-hadeeth, as has been agreed upon by the Imaams of Islaam and the scholars of guidance. And no one opposes them in regard to what they have agreed on except those from the people of vain desires, ignorance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, Al-Haakim and Ibn Al-Qayyim have indeed accused those who criticize them of being heretics. And those who spoke vilely about them (the scholars) have been repudiated severely by Ibn Qutaybah, Ar-Raamaharzamee, Al-Khateeb (Al-Baghdaadee) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that no one speaks against them except for those whom Allaah has led astray and blinded. So if one of these (scholars) errs in an issue from the issues in which Ijtihaad is allowed, it must be clarified but not in the manner of condemning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said with regard to these (scholars):<br />
“So whoever is known to have (the ability to perform) the allowable Ijtihaad, then it is not permissible for him to be mentioned in a manner of condemnation or blame, because Allaah has forgiven him of his error. Instead, it is an obligation due to what he possesses of Eemaan and Taqwaa to show loyalty and love to him, and to fulfill what Allaah has mandated from his rights, such as praising him, making du’aa (supplication) for him, and so on.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom it is permissible to criticize, disparage and warn the people against their harm:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The People of Innovation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible – rather obligatory – to speak about the people of innovation and warn against them and their fabrications, whether individually or as groups and whether they are absent or present. They include those among the Khawaarij, the Rawaafid, the Jahmiyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Karaamiyyah and the people of Rhetoric – those whose knowledge of <i>Kalaam</i> (rhetoric) has brought them to corrupted and deviant beliefs,[3] such as the rejection of all or some of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation to warn against these types of people, their books and their misguided ways. And how great in number they are!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the same applies to those who follow their methodology from the sects [and groups] of our time, such as those who separate themselves away from the people of Tawheed and Sunnah, oppose them and remain far away from their aspects of the methodology. In fact, they wage war against these aspects of the methodology and chase others away from it and its adherents (i.e. the scholars). The likes of these individuals are followed by those who support and defend them. And these followers of theirs mention their good qualities and praise them for it, praising their personalities and leaders. And they have preferred their (innovated) methodologies over the methodology of the people of Tawheed, the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: Reporters of Hadeeth and Witnesses, if they are deemed Unreliable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to criticize these people according to the consensus of the Muslims. Rather, it is an obligation. This has been mentioned and related by An-Nawawee and Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. So if the scholars of the science of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel all agree upon criticizing a narrator, accusing him of lying or making gross mistakes. Or they say: &#8220;His hadeeth are to be rejected&#8221;, &#8220;He has baseless (weak) hadeeth&#8221; or what resembles that, then it is permitted for everyone doing research or quoting to quote or report that. And it is not required of him – in the least – to mention that person&#8217;s good qualities, not to mention doing research on all of his good qualities and then mentioning them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. As for the narrators of which there is differing as to whether or not they are reliable or unreliable, or the narrators who were innovators, then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Type:</b> To list the mention of that narrator&#8217;s criticism first and accept it without considering the sayings of those who declared him reliable would be abandoning something from the Religion and from what has been established on the leader of the Messengers (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And this is a great injustice and a negligence of something that is part of the Religion, which we are obligated to preserve. And it is a trust that falls on the neck of the scholars (i.e. it is their duty). So in this case, for the benefit of the Religion and for preserving it, and for the sake of giving a general benefit to the Muslims, we must seek to verify the reality of the matter. And we must weigh between the sayings of the scholars of Jarh wa-Ta’deel, taking that which is more established, whether it is from the criticism (<i>jarh</i>) or the approval (ta&#8217;deel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is for the purpose of bringing about this beneficial good, not because it is an obligation to make a balance for the condition of that individual who has been declared unreliable (between his good and bad qualities)! So if it is established that he is in fact unreliable after having done the research, it is permitted to relate his unreliability without mentioning this balancing (between those who criticized him and those who approved of him). And no scholar said that (mentioning) this (balancing) was obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the innovator, then if we are in the position of warning against the innovations, then we warn against him, mentioning his innovation only. And it is not an obligation on us to mention any of his good qualities. And if we are in the subject of narrating reports, then it is an obligation to mention his trustworthiness and honesty, if he was in fact trustworthy and honest, for the purpose of benefiting, attaining and preserving the narration. Not for any other purpose, such as the obligation of making a balance (<i>muwaazanah</i>) between his good and bad qualities, as some people claim! So it is not required on us to mention his generosity or his knowledge or his courage or his efforts and good manners, as well as all those other things that have no relation to the subject of narrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were some among the Salaf who would reject the reports of the people of innovation and those who were accused (of weakness, lying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>&#8220;There was once a time in which when a man would say: &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said…&#8217; our eyes would hasten to him and our ears would open wide (to listen) to him. But when the difficulties and disgrace befell the people, we did not take from the people except, for that which we knew.&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Sireen said: <b>&#8220;The people never used to ask about the isnaad (chain of narration). But when the fitnah (afflictions) occurred, they began to say: &#8216;Name your men to us.&#8217; So the Ahl-us-Sunnah would be looked upon and their hadeeth would be accepted. And the people of innovation would be looked upon and their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and Ibn Sireen indicate that this was the general view of the Salaf at the time, during the days of the last of the Companions and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een) after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this existed in them due to their awareness of being in no need of the narrations of innovators. So they took this firm and solid stance against them. But when those who came after them were obliged to take the reports of the truthful ones among the innovators, they accepted it from them, only under certain conditions and stipulations, which consisted of taking the sound from it, while rejecting the crooked and corrupt aspects from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Ishaaq Ibraaheem Ibn Ya&#8217;qoob Al-Jawzjaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Among them was he who deviated from the truth, yet still possessed an honest tongue. And his hadeeth would be widespread amongst the people since he was forsaken for his innovation but trusted with his narration. So concerning these individuals, I see no other alternative but to take from their hadeeth that which is (already) known, so long as his innovation does not become strengthened because of that.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Third: Those whom it is permissible to backbite:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Chapter: What is permissible from backbiting:<br />
Know that backbiting is permissible for a legitimate and legislated reason, of which the allowance for doing it (the backbiting) would not be possible without it. And they are six reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: Oppression</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Seeking help for changing an evil and returning a sinner to what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: When seeking a legal ruling</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourth: Warning and advising the Muslims against an evil. This is in several perspectives, one of which is: Criticizing those who have been declared unreliable in narration and testimony. This is permissible according to the unanimous agreement of the Muslims. Rather it becomes obligatory for necessity&#8217;s sake…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is up to the point where he said:<br />
&#8220;One last case is when one sees a student frequenting an innovator or a deviant, seeking to attain knowledge from him, and he fear that the student may be affected by that. Then it is upon him to advise him of the condition of that innovator, providing that his intention only be for the sake of advising…&#8221; [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His complete words will be mentioned later in its due place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>I say: So you see that he did not make it a condition for one to mention the good qualities of the person who is being warned against. And he did not say that it was an obligation to make a balance (between good and bad qualities) as those people make it an obligation, holding that if one abandons doing this balancing then it goes against the trust and it shuns equity and justice!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Someone once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: ‘It is becoming difficult upon me to say, This person is such and such, and that person is such and such (i.e. criticizing them).&#8217; So he (Ahmad) said: &#8216;If you were to remain silent and I were to remain silent, then when will the ignorant person know the authentic from the weak?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And since advising is obligatory with regard to (bringing) beneficial good in the Religion, specific and general:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as is the case when reporters of Hadeeth have made mistakes or lied, as Yahyaa Ibn Sa&#8217;eed said: “I asked Maalik, Ath-Thawree, Laith Ibn Sa&#8217;ad – I think – and Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee about a man that was accused with regard to hadeeth, so they all said: ‘Convey (expose) his affair.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as is the case when the leaders of innovation from those who voiced sayings contrary to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and who performed worship contrary to that of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Then indeed, clarifying their condition and warning the ummah against them is an obligation based on the unanimous agreement of the Muslims.</b> This is such that it was once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: “Is a man that fasts, prays and makes &#8216;Itikaaf more beloved to you or one that speaks out against the people of innovation?” So he (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: “If he fasts, prays and performs &#8216;Itikaaf then that is only for himself, but if he speaks out against the innovators then indeed this is for all of the Muslims. And this is better.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam, Ibn Taimiyyah, said:<br />
“So he has explained that the benefit of (doing) this is general for all of the Muslims with regard to their Religion. And it is from the types of Jihaad that is done in the Way of Allaah. This is since cleansing Allaah&#8217;s way, His Religion, methodologies and legislation, and repelling the transgression of these individuals and having enmity against them is a collective obligation (<i>fard kifaayah</i>), according to the consensus of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the harm of these individuals, the Religion would have indeed been corrupted. And the corruption experienced from these individuals is greater than the corruption experienced from being conquered by the enemies (of Islaam) during war.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed, when these (enemies) conquered (the Muslim lands), they did not corrupt the hearts (of the Muslims) and what they contained from Religion, except for what came afterward. But as for these individuals, then they corrupt the hearts from the very start.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he has lengthier words on this subject, which will be mentioned later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the true methodology of the Salaf, not just a claim. And it is that methodology, which was followed by Ibn Taimiyyah and others from the sincere and honest Mujaahideen. And no criticism of a critic ever rebuked them, because they did this for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So where is it that making this kind of balancing (between good and bad qualities) must be a condition?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And where is the obligation for mentioning a person’s good qualities (when criticizing him), which we hear so often repeated unjustly in defense of those callers to misguidance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather you have seen that Ibn Taimiyyah held that it was an obligation to refute the people of vain desires. And that it was from the different types of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah, since it is a way of cleansing His Religion, methodologies and legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sayings of the Imaams concerning the People of Innovation and (Hadeeth) Narrators:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the scholars of Islaam have indeed spoken out against the people of innovation and the (weak) reporters. And they did not indicate in the least towards the obligation of making it a condition to create this type of balancing (between good and bad qualities). They authored books on the subject of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel and books in support of the Sunnah and in refutation of the people of innovation and in criticizing them. And they wrote books on the defects (of hadeeth) and books on the fabricated ahaadeeth. They did not make it an obligation to make this type of balancing (<i>Muwaazanah</i>) at all. In fact, they even wrote books specifically with just Jarh (discrediting of reporters) in them, and limiting them to mentioning only those (narrators) that were declared unreliable or those who were spoken about with criticism. So they did not place this principle (of<i>Muwaazanah</i>) as a condition at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Imaam Al-Bukhaaree – who was who he was with regard to possessing authority, religious characteristics, good manners and piety – wrote two books on weak narrators and he named them &#8220;<i>Al-Kabeer</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>As-Sagheer</i>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And An-Nasaa&#8217;ee wrote a book about the weak and rejected narrators called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa wal-Matrookeen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-&#8216;Aqeelee wrote a book on weak narrators, which is known as <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Adiyy authored a book, <i>al-Kaamil</i>, about those who were criticized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan wrote a book specifically about those who were declared unreliable called <i>al-Majrooheen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Daaraqutnee and Ibn Ma&#8217;een have numerous books in which they answer questions concerning weak narrators and rejected reporters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim wrote a book called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i> (Weak Narrators), which is a chapter from his (bigger book) <i>al-Madkhal</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nu&#8217;aim and Ibn Al-Jawzee wrote on this subject also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee wrote three books on those who were declared unreliable and those who were criticized, which are <i>al-Meezaan, al-Mughnee and Deewaan ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr authored <i>Lisaan al-Meezaan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the books on al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel are filled with the discrediting of those who were declared unreliable (<i>majrooheen</i>), especially the books of Imaam Yahyaa Ibn Ma&#8217;een. So they did not make it a condition that this <i>Muwaaznah</i> (mentioning good and bad qualities) must be employed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Indeed, this methodology, which makes this <i>Muwaaznah</i> a condition, is indeed from that which results in: The discrediting returning back to the (past) scholars of Islaam, and their falling into the web of being accused with injustice and treachery (i.e. since they did not mention the good deeds of those whom they criticized). We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from a methodology that produces such kinds of consequences.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, it is appropriate to mention some examples of the criticism of the Imaams (scholars) on some people, in which they just mentioned the criticism without showing any consideration to what they had from good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Marwadhee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Abu &#8216;Abdillaah (Ahmad Ibn Hanbal) once mentioned Haarith al-Muhaasibee and said: &#8216;Haarith is the source of all this affliction – meaning the innovations of the views of Jahm. There is no calamity except for Haarith.'&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Habeeb Ibn Abee Hilaal: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;He is rejected.&#8221; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Habeeb Ibn Jahdar: Ahmad declared him a liar. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Al-Hasan Ibn Dhakwaan: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;His ahaadeeth are forged&#8221; and in one report, he said: &#8220;He is of no significance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Khaalid Ibn Yazeed Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan Al-Hamdaanee: Ahmad said: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He said: &#8220;Jisr bin Farqad: Yahyaa Ibn ad-Darees and others reported about him that: &#8216;He is of no significance.'&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Khaalid bin Iyaas al-Qurshee al-&#8216;Adawee al-Madanee: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Dawood Ibn al-Muhbir: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected.&#8221; [16]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A Lengthy Explanation of the first three points from &#8220;Foundations of the Sunnah &#8221;<br />
Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H)<br />
Source: Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">THE TEXT:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Aboo ’Abdullaah Yahyaa Ibn Abil-Hasan Ibnul-Bannaa narrated to us saying: My father Aboo ’Alee al-Hasan Ibn ’Umar Ibnul-Bannaa related to us saying: Abul-Husayn ’Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Bushraan al-Mu’addil related to us, saying: ’Uthmaan Ibn Ahmad Ibn as-Sammaak reported to us, saying: Aboo Muhammad al-Hasan Ibn ’Abdul-Wahhaab, Abun-Nabr narrated to us, reading it to him from his handwritten copy in the month of Rabee’ul-Awwal, in the year two-hundred and ninety three (293H) who said: Aboo Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Sulaymaan al-Munqaree, in Basrah related to us, saying: ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar narrated to me, saying: [1] I heard Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal [2] – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Fundamental Principles of the Sunnah [3] with us [4] are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Clinging to that which the Companions [5] of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) were upon, taking them as our example to be followed, [6] avoiding innovation; [7] and every innovation is misguidance.” [8]</span></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">COMMENTARY:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: This is the isnaad (chain of narration connected to the text) which &#8211; just as in the case of the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; helps ascertain whether or not the statement and the ascription is authentically related back to the one it is being reported from. As regards the importance of the isnaad, then a few narrations from the Scholars of the early generations will be mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.161H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad is the weapon of the Believer. So if he has no weapon, with what will he fight?”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad with me is from the Religion. If there were no isnaad, then whosoever wanted would relate whatever they wanted. However, when it is said to him: Who narrated to you? He remains silent.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the ascription to Imaam Ahmad, then a number of Scholars have agreed to its ascription from ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar &#8211; one of the close students of the Imaam &#8211; and from these verifying Scholars are: Ibn Abee Ya’laa in Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah (1/241-246), al-Laalikaa‘ee in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/158-164) and also Ibnul-Jawzee in Manaaqib Ahmad (p. 222-228).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The text of this brief ’aqeedah was first printed by Daarul-Manaar in al-Mujaahid magazine (no. 28-29, Sha’baan &#8211; Ramadaan 1411H); and the original is a manuscript copy, transcribed by the Shaykh and muhaddith, Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, in the month of Sha’baan 1374H, from the manuscript copy (no. 68, Q. 10-15) which is housed at the Dhaahiriyyah library in Damascus, Syria. We ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; to grant us the ability to serialize the introduction of this valuable and concise tract, adding to it &#8211; for the benefit of the honourable readers &#8211; a brief commentary and explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: He is Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal ash-Shaybaanee &#8211; the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in his time. Born in Baghdaad in Rabee’ul-Awwal, 164H, he attended the circles of al-Qaadee Aboo Yoosuf (the student of Abee Haneefah) &#8211; rahimahullaah – where he studied fiqh. He left this in favour of hadeeth, which he began to study at the age of thirteen &#8211; having already memorized the Qur‘aan at a young age. He traveled extensively acquiring and learning ahaadeeth from over two-hundred and eighty teachers. From them are: Wakee’ Ibnul-Jarraah, Yahyaa Ibn Sa’eed al-Qattaan, ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee, Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah, ash-Shaafi’ee, Yazeed Ibn Haaroon and others – rahimahullaah. He underwent severe torture and trial due to defending the correct ’aqeedah &#8211; the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), his Companions and those who followed them in ’aqeedah and manhaj) &#8211; being from those who were foremost in clinging to their way, whilst shunning the innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo ’Umayr said: “May Allaah have mercy upon him. There was no one having more patience regarding this world than him, nor anyone more closely resembling those who cam before him, nor anyone more rightfully amongst the righteous. This world was presented to him, but he rejected it, and he expelled innovations.” In his time, he was the Imaam of the people of Hadeeth specifically, and the Muslims in general.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I left Baghdaad, and I did not leave behind me a man better, having more knowledge, or greater Fiqh (understanding), nor having greater taqwaa (piety) than Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaaq Ibn Raahawayh (d.238H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I used to sit with Ahmad and Ibn Ma’een revising ahaadeeth; and I would say: What is the Fiqh (understanding) of it? What is its explanation? So they would remain silent, except for Ahmad.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood (d.275H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The lectures of Ahmad were sittings for the Hereafter. He would not mention in them any worldly affairs; and I never saw him mention this world.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Alee Ibnul-Madeenee (d.324H) – rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah aided this Religion through Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq on the day of apostasy, and through Ahmad Ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to these qualities, he became a sign for Ahlus-Sunnah – as Qutaybah Ibn Sa’eed (d.240H) said, “If you see a man loving Ahmad, then know that he is a person of the Sunnah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Our statement which we hold and take as our Religion is: Clinging to the Book of Allaah, our Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and to the Sunnah of our Prophet, Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), and what is narrated from the Companions, the Taabi’een and the Imaams of Hadeeth. This is what we cling to, and also that to which Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal – may Allaah enlighten his face, rais up his rank and grant him a magnificent reward – used to say, distancing ourselves from those who oppose his statement. Since he was the noble and complete Imaam, by whom Allaah made the truth clear, and removed the misguidance, and made the minhaaj (methodology) clear, and though whom Allaah annihilated the innovation of the innovators, the deviation of the deviant and the doubts of the doubters. So may Allaah have mercy upon him, the foremost Imaam.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taajud-Deen as-Subkee (d.770H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree is the foremost of Ahlus-Sunnah and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal&#8230;” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem al-Harbee (d.285H) – rahimahullaah – said, “I saw Aboo ’Abdullaah, and it was as if Allaah had gathered for him the knowledge of the earlier people and the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal died in the year 241H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: The term ‘Sunnah’ here, refers to the principles and foundations of the correct Islaamic ’aqeedah (belief) and manhaj (methodology), since the Salafus-Saalih (pious predecessors) would apply this term to matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj – as can be seen from their books and writings – for example: [i] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H); [ii] as-Sunnah of al-Athram (d.273H); [iii] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – being part of his Sunan. [iv] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Ibn Abee ’Aasim (d.287H); [v] Kitaabus-Sunnah of ’Abdullaah (d.290H), the son of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal; [vi] as-Sunnah of al-Marwazee (d.292H); [vii] Sareehus-Sunnah of Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree (d.310H); [viii] as-Sunnah of al-Khallaal (d.311H); [ix] Sharhus-Sunnah of al-Barbahaaree (d.329H); [x] as-Sunnah of al-’Asaal (d.349H) and [xi] as-Sunnah of at-Tabaraanee (d.360H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term ‘Sunnah’ was employed in this context to differentiate those matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj of the Salafus-Saalih were upon, from that which was innovated by the deviant and misguided sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: Meaning, with the Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and at the head of them in his time was Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And in this regard, the way of the Salafus-Saalih was to point out to the people, the true followers and adherents to the Sunnah so that their ’aqeedah and manhaj (methodology) could be learnt and adhered to, as Imaam Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H) – rahimahullaah – said, “From the success of a youth, or a non-Arab is that Allaah guides him to a Scholar of the Sunnah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Amr Ibn Qays al-Mulaa‘ee (d.143H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you see a youth when he begins to sprout, keeping company with Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah then have hope for him. If you see him keeping company with the people of Innovation, then fear for him, because the youth is according to his initial upbringing.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: Companions: Arabic: Sahaabah, or Ashaab; singular: Sahaabee. As regards the Sharee’ah definition of ‘Sahaabee’ or ‘Companion,’ then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.825H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The most correct of what I have come across is that a Sahaabee (Companion) is one who met the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) whilst believing in him, and died as a Muslim. So that includes one who lived with him for a long or short time, and those who narrated from him and those who did not, and those who saw him but did not sit with him and those who could not see him due to blindness.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct position is that whosoever accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), even for an hour, then that person is from his Sahaabah.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every person who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), whether for a year, month, a day, or even for an hour, or even just saw him is from his Companions.”[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“H who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) or saw him – from the Muslims – then he is from his Companions.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fathul-Baaree (7/1),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That which al-Bukhaaree states is the saying of Ahmad and the great majority of the Scholars of Hadeeth.” Some of the proofs that the Scholars have used for this are: The saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “There will come upon the people a time when a group from amongst the people will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who has seen the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. So a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who were the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. Then a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who have seen the companions of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You will not cease to be upon good as long as there amongst you those who accompanied me. By Allaah! You will not cease to be upon good as long as there are amongst you those who accompanied those who accompanied and saw me.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these narrations contain a clear proof that a Muslim seeing the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is granted virtue and excellence and is established as being from amongst the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (d.774H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The fact that just seeing him (the Prophet) is enough for one to be called a Companion is clearly stated by al-Bukhaaree, Aboo Zur’ah and others who have written books regarding the names of the Companions – such as Ibn ’Abdul-Barr, Ibn Mandah, Aboo Moosaa al-Madanee, Ibnul-Atheer&#8230;” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the statement attributed to the taabi’ee and Imaam Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib – rahimahullaah – concerning the definition of a Companion, then this cannot be used as a proof at all. This is because al-Haafidh al-’Iraaqee – rahimahullaah – says, “The third saying is what is related from Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib, that he had not used to count someone as being a Companion, except one who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) for a year or two and fought along with him in one or two battles. Ibnus-Salaah said, “What is meant by this if it is authentic from him – refers back to what the Scholars of Usool say (i.e. what is meant be companionship language wise). However, this definition contains restrictions, which will mean that we do not count as Companions those such as Jareer Ibn ’Abdullaah al-Bajalee – who obviously does not fulfill these conditions that are made – but such are people about whom we know of no difference of opinion with regards to them being Companions.” I say, this is not authentic from Ibnul-Musayyib, since the isnaad (chain of narration) from him contains Muhammad Ibn ’Umar al-Waaqidee – who is da’eef (weak) in hadeeth.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: Here the Imaam – rahimahullaah – explains and lays down the signposts for the correct manhaj followed by Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and that is the methodology of the best and most excellent of mankind, the Companions, then those who followed them (the taabi’een), then those who followed them (the atbaa’ut-taabi’een).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah cling to what the first three generations of Muslims were upon – the Salafus-Saalih – whose excellence has been testified to by the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in his statement, “The most excellent of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” [17] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The most excellent Ummah is the generation which I have been sent in, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the following generations, then they have not been praised with any specific excellence. Rather, they have, in general, been spoken ill of by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). Indeed, in some authentic narrations, after mentioning the excellence of the first three generations, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “&#8230;then there will come a people amongst whom fatness will appear and who will testify without having been asked to do so.” [19] And in another narration, “&#8230;then there will come a people in whom you will not find any good.” [20] Also, there occurs in another authentic narration, the wording, “&#8230;then there will come a people who will testify without being asked to do so, who make promises but do not keep them, who are treacherous and not trustworthy and fatness will appear amongst them.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is the first three generations – the Salafus-Saalih – whose era has been praised with an excellence, whose path is to be followed and whose understanding of the Religion is to be accepted and affirmed. ’Aa‘ishah – radiyallaahu ’anhaa – said: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and said, ‘Who is the most excellent of mankind?’ So the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The generation which I am in, then the second, then the third.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the first of these generations – the Companions – radiyallaahu ’anhum – who were the foremost in excellence from mankind; since they were: [i] those who learnt the Religion directly from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and, “Being informed is not like seeing.” [23] [ii] those who knew best and understood the Religion – and this is the root of their excellence – as the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whosoever Allaah intends to show excellence to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.” [24] [iii] They were those who followed it the best, and [iv] They were the ones who were furthest away from and remained free from innovations. About the excellence of the Salafus-Saalih, and the excellence of those who follow them, and the obligation to follow their path, Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those foremost of those who first migrated and those that helped them and those who follow them in goodness, Allaah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – the Most Perfect – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever contends with the Messenger, even after guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers; We shall leave him in the Path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “This is a clear definition and a decisive proof upon the worshipper, in making following the path of the Believers obligatory. And who were the Believers at the time this aayah was revealed, except the Companions (radiyallaahu ’anhum). Thus, Allaah has threatened those who leave their way and traverse other than their path, with lowliness and humiliation in this world; and a severe punishment in the Hereafter.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What further adds to the above decisive proofs, and is considered to be the correct explanation of those aayaat, are the ahaadeeth of the Propht (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “Indeed my Ummah will split up into seventy-three. All of them are in the Fire except one.” It was said, ‘What is the one?’ He said, “The Jamaa’ah.” And in another narration, he said, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He – sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam – also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those of you who survive after me shall see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Caliphs after me. Cling to it tightly and beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray.” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The stars are the custodians of the sky, when the stars pass away, that which has been decreed for the sky will come upon it. I am the custodian for my Companions, so when I pass away there will come upon my Companions that which is decreed for them. And my Companions are the custodians for my Ummah, so when my Companions pass away, that which has been decreed upon my Ummah will come upon it.” [28] Below is a summary of the aforementioned proofs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] That the iftiraaq (splitting-up) of the Ummah into various sects – on the basis of differences in ’aqeedah and manhaj – has been foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] All of the various firaq (sects) have been threatened with Hellfire, except those who adhere to the ’aqeedah and the manhaj of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is al-Firqatun-Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) and the Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] That the authentic hadeeth about iftiraaq (splitting-up) is an explanation of, and in full agreement with the aayah from Sooratun-Nisaa‘ [4:115] in that all those who, “follow a path other than that of the Believers (the Companions),” have been threatened with Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] The obligation to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, cannot be fulfilled, except by avoiding and shunning innovation and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] When differences and innovations arise, it is obligatory to cling to the Sunnah, and also that which the Jamaa’ah have ijmaa’ (consensus and agreement) upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] That the Companions were made examples to be followed and were for this Ummah, after the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), the custodians of the correct knowledge, manhaj and ’aqeedah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vii] The root of the Companions excellence is in their understanding of and clinging onto the correct ’aqeedah and manhaj and also in their defending it, preserving it, and in their conveying it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[viii] This is also the root cause for the excellence of those who followed the Companions in the next two generations. So it is binding upon the Muslims to follow the path taken by the Salafus-Saalih, those Muslims who – living in the first three generations – adhered to the ’aqeedah and manhaj, and have been praised with an excellence over and above the rest of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ix] Opposing the way of the Salafus-Saalih is considered iftiraaq (splitting-up) and opposing them in matters related to Islaamic manhaj is also considered iftiraaq. So whoever chooses to oppose their knowledge and understanding of the Revelation, has split from them; and has therefore split from the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and has taken one of the forbidden and innovated paths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, Allaah looked into the hearts of the servants and found the heart of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He chose him for Himself and sent him as a Messenger. Then He looked into the hearts of the servants after Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and found the hearts of the Companions to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He made them ministers of His Messenger, fighting for His Religion. So whatever the Muslims (i.e. the Companions) hold to be good, then it is good with Allaah, and whatever the Muslims hold to be evil, then it is evil with Allaah.” [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barabahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundations upon which the Jamaa’ah is made clear is the Companions of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, so whoever does not take from them has gone astray and innovated; and every innovation is misguidance and misguidance and its people are in the Fire.” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “The truth is that which comes from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Th Sunnah is that which the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) laid down, and the Jamaa’ah is that which the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) united upon, in the Caliphate of Aboo Bakr, ’Umar and ’Uthmaan. So he who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and that which the Companions were upon, is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation, is saved and his Religion is preserved – if Allaah wills. Since the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “My Ummah will split up into seventy-three sects,” and he told us that which would be the saved sect, saying, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” So this is the cure, the explanation, the dear affair and the straight and distinct road.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) drew a line for us and said, “This is the Straight Path of Allaah.” Then he drew lines to its right and its left and said, “These are other paths; upon every one of them is a devil calling towards it.” Then he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, this is My Straight Path, so follow it. And do not follow other paths, they will separate you from His Path.” [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the statement of Allaah, “And do not follow other paths,” ad-Daarimee relates in his Sunan (1/68) and al-Bayhaqee relates in al-Madkhal ilas-Sunan (no. 200) that Mujaahid (d.204H) said explaining this aayah, “Innovations and doubts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-’Aaliyah (d.90H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right, nor the left. Rather, be upon the Straight Path and be upon the Sunnah of your Prophet and that which his Companions were upon&#8230;And beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. Rather, stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.” [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: Arabic: Bida’ (singular: Bid’ah). Linguistically, bid’ah means: a newly invented matter. The Sharee’ah definition of bid’ah is: “A newly invented way (beliefs or actions) in the Religion, in imitation to the Sharee’ah (prescribed Law), by which nearness of Allaah is sought, not being supported by an authentic proof; neither in its foundations, nor the manner in which it is performed.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaatibee (d.777H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone who follows the mutashaabihaat (those aayaat without a clear meaning), or twists the underlying meanings or gives a meaning to the aayaat not given to it by the Salafus-Saalih, or clings on to the very weak and unauthentic ahaadeeth, or takes that which is apparent as a proof – for every action, statement or belief in agreement with his objetives and intentions, not finding a fundamental proof for understanding it in that manner – then this is the method of deduction and derivation which gives rise to innovations and those who innovate.” [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul-Haadee (d.745H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an aayah or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf, nor did they have any knowledge of it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would mean that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.756H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Inventing an explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah – to which the Salaf and the Scholars ar in opposition – necessitates one of two things; [i] either the explanation in itself a mistake, or [ii] that the sayings of the Salaf which run contrary to it are in error! And no one with an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf is the one who is mistaken and in error.” [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And avoiding bida’ (innovations) is one of the great usool (foundations) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and it involves: [i] keeping away from them; [ii] having hatred for them; [iii] warning the people about them; [iv] clarifying them to the people so that they do not fall into them; [v] refuting the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Saaboonee (d.449H) said about Ahlus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They follow the Salafus-Saalih – the Imaams and Scholars of the Muslims – and they cling to the firm Religion that they clung to and the firm truth. And they hate Ahlul-Bid’ah (people of innovation) who innovate into the Religion that which is not from it. They do not love them and they do not keep company with them. They do not listen to their sayings, nor sit with them, nor argue with them about the Religion, nor debate with them. Rather, they protect their ears from their futility – things which if they pass through the ears and settle in the hearts – will cause harm and will cause doubts and wicked ideas to appear. And concerning this, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic sent down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when you see people engaged in vain discourse, then turn away from them unless they turn to different theme.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:68].” [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaanee (d.1255H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this aayah contains a severe reprimand for those who allow people to sit with the innovators, those who twist the Words of Allaah, play around with His Book, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). And refer them back to their own misleading desires and wicked innovations. Since, if he is unable to reprimand them and change them from what they are upon, then at the very least, he should avoid sitting with them – and that is easy for him, not difficult. And the innovators may make use of his presence with them – even though he may be free from their mistakes – through a doubt by which they will beguile the common people, in which case his presence will cause an extra evil, in addition to just listening to their evil.” [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Indeed, Allaah does not accept the repentance of an innovator, until he ceases from the innovation.” [40] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Every innovation is misguidance and going astray.” [41] And he also said, “Whosoever innovates, or accommodates an innovator, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, the Angels and the whole of mankind.” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Innovations are more beloved to Iblees than sin. Since a sin may be repented from, but innovation is not repented from.” [43] The following narrations will highlight – if Allaah wills – the manhaj (methodology) adopted by our Salafus-Saalih with regards to the mubtadi’een (innovators). A man said to ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar, ‘Najdah (a man from the Khawaarij) says such and such.’ So Ibn ’Umar prevented himself from listening for fear of that some of it should enter into his heart. [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovations and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them.” [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa‘ Bint ’Ubayd said: Two of the people of vain desires and innovations entered upon Ibn Seereen (d.110H), and said, “O Abaa Bakr, may we speak with you?” So he said, “No!” They said, “May we recite an aayah?” He from the Book of Allaah said, “No, indeed either you must get up and leave me, or I will get up and leave.” So said, “O Abaa Bakr, what harm would they left, so some of the people it have done to you, for them to recite an aayah from the Book of Allaah?” He said, “I feared that they would read an aayah to me and distort it, and that would remain in my heart.” [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An innovator asked Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H), “O Abaa Bakr, may I ask you about a word?’ He turned away and indicated with his hand, “No, not even half of a word.” [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem Ibn Maysirah (d.132H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who honours an innovator has assisted him in the demolition of Islaam.” [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Qilaabah (d.140H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovation, because I do not feel secure that they will not drown you in their misguidance and make part of what you used to know unclear to you.”[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Awn (d.150H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever sits with an innovator is worse than him.” [50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) – rahimahullaah, ‘A person says, ‘I sit with Ahlus-Sunnah and I sit with the innovators.’ So al-Awzaa’ee said, ‘This person desires to fluctuate between the truth and falsehood.” [51] Commenting upon this statement, Ibn Battah said, “Indeed, al-Awzaa’ee has spoken the truth. And I say, indeed this person does not know the truth from falsehood, nor faith from disbelief.” [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.164H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Whosoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allaah and is entrusted to the innovation.” [52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Fudayl Ibn ’Iyaad (d.187H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Do not sit with an innovator, for I fear that curses will descend upon you.” [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“How evil are the people of innovation, we do not give them salaam.” [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said, “That a person meets Allaah with every sin except Shirk is better than meeting Him upon any one of the innovated beliefs.”[55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood as-Sijjistaanee (d.275H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, “If I see a man from the people of the Sunnah sitting with a man from the people of innovation, should I speak with him?” He said, “No, you should first inform him that the one whom you saw him with is a person of innovation. Either he will cease speaking to the innovator, so continue speaking with him, or if not, then consider him to be like him. Ibn Mas’ood said that a person is like his friend.” [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the people of knowledge throughout the ages continued warning the masses against the innovators and considered this matter important enough to dedicate chapters in their various books about this. For example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood placed a chapter in his Sunan (4/197), called: “Chapter: Turning away from the innovators and having hatred for them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh al-Mundhiree (d.656H) – rahimahullaah – placed a chapter in at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (3/14) called: “Deterrent against loving the people of innovation, since a person will be with those whom he loves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – says in al-Adhkaar (p.323), “Chapter: Disassociating from the people of innovation and sin.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) – rahimahullaah – said in al-I’tiqaad (p.236), “Chapter: The prohibition from sitting with the people of innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Laalikaa‘ee (d.418H) said in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/128), “What is related from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) with respect to the forbiddance of debating with the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.516H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) informed about the division in this Ummah, and the manifestation of desires and innovations in it. And he designated salvation for those who follow his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. So it is upon the Muslim, that if he sees a man having something from innovations and desires in belief, or something neglected from the Sunnah, that he makes Hijrah (migration) from him, and he frees himself from him, and abandons him in life and death. So he must not greet him if he meets him, and he must not answer him if he (i.e. the innovator) begins the greeting, until he abandons his innovation and returns to the truth…So verily the hijrah from the people of desires and innovation continues until they repent.’’ [57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Aboo Ya’laa (d.333H) – rahimahullaah – said in Hajarul-Mubtadi’ (p. 32), “There is ijmaa’ (consensus) from the Companions and the taabi’een as regards disassociating and cutting-off from the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to mention here, the distinction that the Scholars make between a newly-invented matter being bid’ah (innovation) and passing a judgement upon the one who is involved in it that he is a mubtadi’ (innovator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: Just as the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said in his sermons, “&#8230;and every innovation is misguidance and all that misguides, misguides to the Fire.” [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people think it is good.” [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barbahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Beware of small innovations, because they will grow until they become large. This was the case with every innovation introduced into this Ummah. It began as something small, bearing resemblance to the truth, which is why those who entered into it were misled and then were unable to leave it. So it grew and became the religion that they followed, and thus deviated from the Straight Path and left Islaam. And may Allaah have mercy upon you! Examine carefully the speech of everyone you hear from in your time particularly. So do not act in haste, and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) speak about it, or any of the Scholars? So if you find a narration from them about it, cling to it, do not go beyond it for anything and do not give precedence to anything over it and thus fall into the Fire.”[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Sunnah is – by Him besides whom none has the right to be worshipped – between those who exceed the limits and those who fall short. So be patient upon it, may Allaah have mercy upon you. For indeed, Ahlus-Sunnah were a minority from those who preceded and shall be a minority from those to come. They did not accompany the people of excessiveness when they exceeded, nor the people of innovation when they innovated. Rather, they persevered upon the Sunnah, until they met their Lord.” [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, two major principles of manhaj – with regards to the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – have been covered in the first part of this serialization: Firstly, “The source for the ’aqeedah is: the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and the ijmaa’ (consensus) of the Salafus-Saalih.” Secondly, “Every newly invented matter in the Religion is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.” [63]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Printed and Published by : Presidency of Islamic research, Ifta propogation, and Guidance</strong><br />
Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Govt Publication – <a href="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/indispensable-implication-of-sunnah-and-caution-against-innovation-ibn-baz.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF</strong></a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allâh who completed the religion for us, perfected the blessing on us and chose Islam as our religion. May the blessings and peace be upon His slave and Messenger, who called upon people to obey his Lord and cautioned against extravagance, innovation and disobedience; and may Allâh bless his posterity, his companions and those who follow his footsteps till the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been acquainted with the article published on the first page of the weekly magazine <em>Edarat</em> of Kanpur , an industrial city of Uttar Pardesh in India , which contains an implied campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , its adherence to the Islamic creed, and its opposition to innovations. The writer alleges that the creed of the <em>Salaf</em> (early adherents to Islam) which is held by Saudi Kingdom does not agree with the<em> Sunnah</em>. By this, the writer aims at creating division amongst the<em> Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and encouraging the innovations and superstitions. This attitude, no doubt, is most abominable and dangerous and aims at offending the Religion of Islam and spreading innovations and deviations from the truth. Furthermore, the article concentrates clearly on the subject of celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s birthday as an excuse to discuss the creed of the Kingdom and its rulers. Therefore, I consider it necessary to enlighten the people on this subject. So seeking help of Allâh, I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم or somebody else. In fact, it must be stopped, as it is an innovation in the religion. Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم neither celebrated it, nor commanded others to do this for himself; or for anyone who died before him amongst the Prophets, or for his daughters, or his wives, or his other relatives. The rightly-guided Caliphs, the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم or the Successors who rightly followed them did not celebrate this event, nor did anyone of the Muslim scholars in the centuries before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم best, they loved him more, and followed the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> better than those who came after them. If celebrating his birthday was a good deed, they would have done it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are commanded to follow and forbidden to innovate. This is because of the perfection of the Islamic religion and the sufficiency of what Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم have given us and are accepted by <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah.</em> The Muslim community of the Companions and those who followed them in the best way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it, will have it rejected). (Transmitted by<em> Al-Bukhâri</em> and <em>Muslim)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Muslim who reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever does an act which is not in agreement with our matter, will have it rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tradition, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; عليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين من بعدي, تمسكوا بها وعضوا عليها بالنواجذ, وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور, فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You must keep to my <em>Sunnah </em>and of the <em>Sunnah</em> of the rightly-guided Caliphs, cling to it firmly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every new matter is an innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to say in every Friday <em>Khutbah</em> (sermon, religious talk):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; فإن خير الحديث كتاب الله وخير الهدي هدي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم وشر الأمور محدثاتها وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best discourse is the Book of Allâh and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh, and the worst matter is that of innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these<em> Ahâdith</em> (traditions) contain a strong caution against innovations and a warning that such an act is a deviation from the right course. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم warned the people of the gravity of these innovations and of their bad consequences. There are many traditions adduced in this connection. And the Almighty has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), &#8230;&#8221; (V.59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَنْ تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah</em> &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah </em>(disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&#8221; (V.24:63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh the Almighty said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day and remembers Allâh much.&#8221; (V.33:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنْصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُمْ بِإِحْسَانٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the first to embrace Islam of the <em>Muhâjirun</em> (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansâr</em> (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the <em>Muhâjirun</em>) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allâh is well-pleased with them as they are well- pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow ( Paradise ), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&#8221; (V.9:100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8230;&#8221; (V.5:3).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse decisively indicates that the Almighty Allâh has completed the religion for this <em>Ummah,</em> and has showered His blessings on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم passed away only after he had imparted the complete Message of Allâh to the <em>Ummah </em>as well as his legislations concerning sayings and deeds. He also stressed that all things invented by people and then attributed to the religion of Islam are innovations and to be rejected, even if their inventors did so in good faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the righteous Successors after them warned the people against innovations as they add to Islam and legislate what is not permitted by Allâh, in line with the enemies of Allâh such as the Jews and the Christians who added to their religion and innovated what was not allowed by Allâh. Moreover, to admit innovation in Islam is to admit that Islam is incomplete and imperfect. Such a belief is not only an evil but contradicts the following verse: &#8220;This day have I perfected your religion for you,&#8221; and the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم which warn us against innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the others, means that the religion is not perfected by Allâh (the Glorious, the Almighty) for this <em>Ummah,</em> and the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم did not impart to the people what was necessary regarding their religious duties, till these late ones appeared and invented in the religion what is not permitted by Allâh, thinking that this would bring them nearer to Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this is a great danger and is tantamount to criticizing Allâh the Almighty and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم ; whereas Allâh the Almighty has already completed the religion and perfected His Grace, and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has conveyed the Message openly and informed the <em>Ummah</em> of all such ways that will lead them to the Paradise and save them from Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to an authentic<em> Hadith,</em> on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas, Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; ما بعث الله من نبي إلا كان حقا عليه أن يدل أمته على خير ما يعلمه لهم وينذرهم شر ما يعلمه لهم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) did not send a Prophet but obliged him to lead his people to the best way which is known to him, and warn them against the worst which is known to him.&#8221; (Transmitted by<em> Muslim)</em><br />
It is well-known that our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is the best of all the Prophets, the last and the most perfect of them regarding the way he conveyed the Message and advised his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> been an act of religion chosen by Allâh for His slaves, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would have either explained that to his people and would have celebrated it during his life, or his Companions would have done it. As these did not happen, it becomes clear that Islam has no concern with <em>Milâd.</em> On the contrary, it is one of the innovations against which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has warned his people as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A host of scholars have not only rejected the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> but have warned against it in view of the evidences given above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the rule of the Islamic <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> all matters regarding legalization or prohibition and all disputes among the people, should be referred to the Book of Allâh and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in line with the saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.&#8221; (V .4:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge). (42:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring this issue back to the Book of Allâh, we find it ordaining upon us to follow Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in his commandments and warns us against whatever he prohibits. Furthermore it tells us that Allâh has perfected the religion for the people. So, as long as <em>Milâd</em> is not among the teachings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , it cannot be a part of the religion which Allâh has perfected for us and asked us to adhere to by following the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again when we refer this issue back to the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , we do not find either the Prophet or the Companions doing it by themselves or asking others to do it. So it becomes evident that<em> Milâd,</em> is not a part of religion, rather one of innovations and blind imitation of the people of the Scripture, i.e. the Jews and the Christians in their festivals. With this argument in mind, it becomes crystal clear for everyone having the least insight and inclination towards truth and justice, that celebrating any birthday has nothing to do with Islam. It is rather among the innovations which Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم warned against emphatically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man must not be deceived by seeing a large number of people doing it throughout the world because the truth is known and recognized by the evidences of<em> Shari&#8217;ah</em> and not by the acts of a great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says regarding the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَى تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they say, `None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&#8217; These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ): `Produce your proof if you are truthful.&#8221;&#8217; (V.2:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Almighty also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَإِنْ تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allâh&#8217;s path. They follow nothing but conjectures, and they do nothing but lie.&#8221; (V.6:116).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these innovations, in addition to their innovatory nature, also do not usually escape from a number of other evils, such as mixed gatherings of men and women, songs accompanied by musical instruments. drinking intoxicants, narcotics and the like. They may also involve the worst thing i. e. the greatest <em>Shirk,</em> through showing exaggeration in Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and other saints and through praying to him, invoking his help or believing that he knows what is hidden and all similar claims which render a believer as an infidel. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allâh has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; وإياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of extravagance in the religion: It has caused the people before you to perish&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am just a slave. So simply say: The slave of Allâh and His Messenger&#8221;. (Transmitted by <em>Bukhâri)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is curious to note that a great many people participate most actively in these celebrations and defend them vehemently, while they sit back from attending the obligatory forms of worship such as daily and Friday prayers. They are not even ashamed of this, nor do they realize that they are committing a great evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this shows the weakness of their Faith, their short-sightedness, and the deeply ingrained rust on their hearts because of sins and disobedience. We ask Allâh&#8217;s protection for us and for all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is even more astonishing to note that some people believe that Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم is present at <em>Milâd.</em> Consequently they stand to greet and welcome him. That is not only a sheer lie but a worst form of ignorance, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Resurrection, nor shall he meet the people or attend their meetings. Instead, he shall remain in his grave till the Day of Resurrection while his soul rests at the highest of the high with his Lord in the most exalted and highest place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ. ‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;After that, surely, you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; (V.23:15, 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; أنا أول من يشق عنه القبر يوم القيامة وأنا أول شافع وأول مُشَفَّع &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the first one to rise from the grave on the Resurrection Day and I will be the first intercessor and the first one whose intercession is to be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforesaid evidences from the Qur&#8217;ân and <em>Hadith</em> prove beyond doubt that the dead people will come out of their graves only on the Day of Resurrection. All the scholars of Islam agree upon this. A Muslim should be aware of these things and must not be easily misled by the innovations and the superstitions created by the ignorant people with no authority from Allâh at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for offering the blessings and greetings (<em>Salât</em> and <em>Salâm</em>) to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , they are among the most preferred and virtuous deeds in accordance with the Saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh sends His<em> Salat</em> (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) and also His angels too (ask Allâh to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your <em>Salat</em> on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e.<em> As- Salâm-o-Alaikum)</em>.&#8221; (V.33:56).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من صلى عليَّ واحدة صلى الله عليه عشرا &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever sends blessings on me one time, Allâh sends blessings on him ten times&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed on all times, particularly at the end of each prayer. It is held obligatory at the last <em>Tashahhud</em> of each <em>Salât </em>(prayer) by most of the scholars. It is strongly required at a number of occasions such as immediately after <em>Adhân,</em> at the mention of the name of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , during the day of Friday and the night preceding it, according to a host of <em>Ahâdith.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to emphasize regarding this issue. I hope it will satisfy everyone whom Allâh has shown the light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How sad it is to see some devoted Muslims, known for their strength of Faith and love for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم organizing such innovatory celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us ask such people: Tell us, if you belong to<em>Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and follow the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , whether he himself or one of his Companions or their Successors did this or is it no more than a blind-following of the enemies of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians and the like ؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The love of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is not reflected by the celebration on his birthday, but by obeying him, believing in his teachings, keeping away from what he prohibited and by worshipping Allâh in the way he prescribed for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reflected through offering<em> Salat</em> and <em>Salâm</em> to him from time to time, particularly at the mention of his name and during prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya,</em> as the writer tends to put it, are not new in rejecting all such innovations. Their creed is to hold fast to the Book of Allâh and the<em> Sunnah</em> of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ; to follow his footsteps and those of his rightly- guided Successors; to believe and practise what was propounded by the virtuous Predecessors and the <em>Imâms </em>of learning and guidance who were capable to issue religious injunction concerning the knowledge of Allâh, and His Attributes of perfection and dignity as shown in the Glorious Book and the authentic <em>Ahâdith</em> (traditions) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and as wholeheartedly accepted by his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya</em> believe in them, the way they are reported without any alteration, personification, exemplifying or negation of such attributes. They stick to the way of the Successors and their followers from among the people of learning, Faith and piety. They believe that the foundation of the Faith is to bear witness that there is none to be worshipped except Allâh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. To them, this is the root of Faith and one of its most exalted branches as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They know in accordance with the consensus of the Muslims, that this root requires knowledge, acknowledgement and practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It implies that none is to be worshipped except Allâh the Almighty, Who has no associates at all. It further implies the negation of worshipping any other except Him. It shows why jinn and mankind were created; why the Messengers were sent and why the Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, <em>Ibâdah</em> (worship) is not only complete submission and love but also complete obedience and veneration as well. Islam is the only religion prescribed by Allâh and disseminated by the Prophets and nothing, except it, is acceptable to Allâh whether in the past or the present. The one who submits his will to Allâh as well as to someone else beside Him, is a <em>Mushrik</em> (polytheist). The same is true for the one who prays to Allâh and someone else beside Him. As for the one who does not submit to Him, he is arrogant concerning his duties towards his Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Almighty says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَسُولًا أَنِ اُعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from)<em> Tâghût</em> (all false deities etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût</em> besides Allâh).&#8221; (V.16:36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the creed of the <em>Wahhabiyya</em> is based upon fulfillment of witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh and completely abandoning all innovations, superstitions and whatever goes against the <em>Shari&#8217;ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab رحمه الله believed and invited others to believe. Whoever accredits to him anything contrary to it, does not only lie but commits a great sin and claims what is totally unfounded. He will, no doubt, receive what Allâh has promised to all the fabricators of lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has shown &#8211; through a series of his well-known treatises and scholarly books on the topic of the &#8220;Declaration of Oneness: <em>La ilaha illAllâh&#8221; &#8211;</em> that no one deserves worship except Allâh the Almighty, and that this type of worship should be devoid of all sorts of <em>Shirk</em> whether big or small. Anyone who is aware of these writings, his way of preaching and calling people to Allâh and of the way of his pupils and disciples, can easily find out that his approach was not different from that of our virtuous Predecessors, the great Imâms of learning and guidance. Indeed, he has propounded what they did throughout their lives concerning the worship of Allâh Alone and leaving all innovations and superstitions aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the foundation of the Saudi regime and this view is held by the scholars of Saudi Arabia . The hard attitude shown by the Saudi government is directed only against the superstitions and innovations in contradiction with Islam, or the extreme type of extravagance which is totally prohibited by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . All Muslims, scholars and rulers of Saudi Arabia hold great respect and love for every Muslim regardless of his affiliation to any group or country in the world. They do reject all types of celebrations or gatherings which are based on innovation, with no authority from Allâh or His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .<br />
They oppose them because every new matter in the religion is an innovation and because the Muslims are commanded to follow, not to innovate. Islam is perfect and complete by itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in no need of any addition after what Allâh and His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم have ordained and what the <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jamâ&#8217;ah,</em> from among the Companions, the Successors and their followers have already received. To forbid celebrating the birthday of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to its innovative nature in addition to the signs of extravagance and <em>Shirk</em> normally associated with it, is not un-Islamic or derogatory to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . Instead, it is an act of obedience as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; إياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم الغلو في الدين &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the extravagance in matters of religion. Those before you have perished because of extravagance in the matters of religion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am but a slave. So simply say: `Slave of Allâh and His Messenger.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to point out regarding the aforesaid article.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allâh help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion, to continually confirm us on it, stick to Sunnah and keep away from the innovation. Indeed He is Generous and Kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allâh shower His blessings and mercy upon our Prophet Muhammad, his posterity and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith, Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is enlightened by the Book and the Sunnah in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Hadeeth, as-Salafiyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is darkened in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Bida’ and misguidance, those who oppose the people of Hadeeth and wage war against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the present day political groups – who have among them Ikhwaan Muslimoon and their likes – and the deviant sects – who have among them Jamaat Tabligh – want this darkness to remain in dominance over the Islaamic world and to cover it, they do not even move against it. They have no intention of eliminating it and they have no Manhaj (methodology) to direct them to its removal or to establish Tawheed and the light of the Book and the Sunnah, taking its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they guard this darkness &#8211; especially the darkness of the Rafidah and Soofeeyah- with the justification that they are combating the enemies of Islaam, although they definitely do not do this. Their justification is that they say, ‘We cooperate in what we agree upon and overlook what we differ upon,’ which they justify further with their claim that they gather the Muslims together along with the Rawafidah and the extreme Soofees in order to confront the enemies of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, they wage war against the people of Hadeeth, placing different obstacles and hindrances in front of them which then prevent the people from being enlightened by that which the People of Hadeeth have of the light of Tawheed and the light of the Book, the Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-as-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How long will the defence of this darkness subjected upon the Ummah continue?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When will the Muslims see this light?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said, quoting as-Samaanee -Rahimullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Every sect from the people of Bida’ claims that they adhere to the Sharia’ of Islaam and that the truth the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- established is what they believe in and profess. However, Allah has denied them that as the truth and correct ‘Aqeedah will only be with the People of Hadeeth and Athaar because they successively took their Deen and beliefs with from those who preceded them, generation by generation, until they reached the Tabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tabi’een took it from the Companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and the Companions took it from the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no way of knowing what the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- called the people to, of the straight path, except by way of what the People of Hadeeth followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What shows that the People of Hadeeth are upon the truth is that if you were to research all the books authored by them, from the first to the last, the oldest to the newest, you would find &#8211; despite the fact that they are from different countries and time periods with vast distances between their lands, each of them living in their own regions- that in the matter of belief they are on one path, they flow in one direction following that path and they do not diverge from it, nor do they deviate from it. Their hearts are one heart; you do not see any differing in what they narrated nor any divisions or differing in any issue, no matter how small it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if everything they uttered with their tongues and what they narrated from the Salaf were gathered you would find it as though it had come from one heart and spoken by one tongue. So is there any evidence clearer than this to show the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islaamic Faith)&gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason that the people of Hadeeth are united is because they take their Deen and method of narration from the Book and the Sunnah and so, they inherit unity and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Bida’ took the Deen from their intellects so they inherited separation and differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed conveying and narrating from trustworthy, precise narrators ensures that differences are rare and if there were a difference it would be in a single word or the wording of a narration. This differing does not harm the Deen, not does it belittle it. As for following intellects and desires, ideas and opinions, they rarely bring unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have seen that the Companions of Hadeeth, past and present, are those who travelled for these Aathaar. They sought them and took from their sources, they memorized them and became delighted by them, they called to following these narrations and they rebuked those who opposed them. They had numerous narrations between them such that they became famous due to them, just as a craftsman becomes famous because of his skill and what he produces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we saw a people who became disconnected from their memorization and knowledge and deviated from following the well-known, authentic narrations. They absolved themselves from the companionship of its people and attacked the narrations and their people. These people abandoned the rights due to this knowledge, they ascribed evil examples to it and to the people of hadeeth, giving them the vilest of descriptions. So, they called them Nawasib (haters of the family of the Prophet), Mushabiha (those who compare Allaah to the creation), Hashaweeyah (those who busy themselves with things of no benefit) or Mujjassama (those who ascribe a physical body to Allaah). So we came to know, from the correct proofs and supporting evidences, that the people of hadeeth have more right to it (i.e. the knowledge of hadeeth/narrations) than the rest of the sects.’ [Mukhtasir as-Sawaaiq pg 423-429]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The new opponents of the People of Hadeeth continually repeat the attacks that the communist, laymen and Baaith party (a political party with strong socialist tendencies) use against their opponents from amongst the Muslims and other than them, attacking with such statements as, ‘they are spies,’ ‘working for America,’ ‘ scholars of the royal courts’ or ‘scholars who want meals.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for guidance that everyone returns to the truth, turning away from falsehood and departing from the darkness of Bida’.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is well-known about what occurs when people gather together upon some matter, is that any group which becomes strong and has many followers, then you will definitely find in them the pure and the impure, the justly-balanced and the imbalanced, the extreme and the moderate. And a well established fact is that the extremists are more vocal and have greater acceptance, since the ones who are justly-balanced follow a middle course. And those who seek this balanced approach are few in number, in every age and plate. As for extremism, then this is what most people thrive upon, and what the over-whelming majority incline towards &#8211; and this has been the path of the various sects and religions as well. So the extremists try to monopolise their being mention amongst people and to be single in their <i>da&#8217;wah</i>. And they did not find any way to gain a monopoly over people except by extremism, which they achieve by degrading people and belittling them at every possible opportunity; either by their tongues, or other than that. And the first to open this door &#8211; the door of unleashing their tongues against there who oppose them &#8211; were the Khawaarij. And this is the route by which they came to the masses, through the door of <i>takfeer</i> (declaring a Muslim to be an unbeliever), in order that the masses would flee from other than them, so that they could then secure a relationship with the masses for themselves. Then this disease was transmitted to others, such that the extreme elements of each group started unjustly declaring Muslims to be either unbelievers, sinners, innovators or deviants &#8230;&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ERR OR DEVIATE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Imaams of the Sunnah and the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the people of knowledge and <i>eemaan</i> (faith) have in them <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice), <i>&#8216;ilm</i> (knowledge) and <i>rahmah</i> (mercy), and they know the truth which <i>conforms</i> to the Sunnah and which is free from innovations. They do justice to those who depart from the Sunnah and the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, even if they have been wronged, just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who believe!! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be witnesses, and do not let the hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:8]. Likewise, they are merciful to the creation; desiring for them goodness guidance and knowledge. They never intend for them any harm or evil. Rather, when they criticise them and explain to them their error, ignorance or wrong-doing, then their purpose in doing so is only to clarify the truth, and to be merciful to the creation, to enjoin the good and forbid the evil, and to make the word of Allaah uppermost so that the way of life becomes purely for Allaah.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BALANCED APPROACH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When dealing with the people of sin, one must not exceed the limits prescribed by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> &#8211; neither in hating, censuring, preventing, abandoning or chastising them. Rather, the one who does so should be told: Worry about your own self. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided, as Allaah &#8211; the Mort High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not let your hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:8]. And Allaah said: <b>&#8220;And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you, but do not transgress the limits.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:190]. Indeed, many of those who command and forbid overstep the limits set by Allaah, either through <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) or <i>dhulm</i> (injustice). Thus, this issue (of justice) must be firmly maintained, whether it is in regards to censuring the unbelievers, the hypocrites, the sinners or the disobedient ones.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: &#8220;The one commanding the good or forbidding the evil should do so in the way prescribed by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>; with knowledge, gentleness and patience, and with good intentions, and by following a balanced approach. All of this enters into Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Beware of your own selves. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:105) &#8230; There is in this <i>Aayah</i> (Verse) another meaning as well, which is that a person must turn towards that which will be of benefit to him, both in knowledge and action, and he must avoid what does not concern him &#8211; as the conveyer of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (i.e. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<i> &#8220;From the perfection of a person&#8217;s Islaam is to leave alone that which doer not concern him.&#8221;</i>4 This especially applies to a person delving into that which doer not concern him regarding someone&#8217;s religious or worldly affairs. Thus, such a person may speak out of envy or desire for position; or act either with deliberate oppression, or foolish scorn and sarcasm. How often does Shaytaan make such an act appear to be an art of commanding the good or prohibiting the evil, or jihaad in the path of Allaah, whereas it is actually an act of injustice and transgression!&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said: &#8220;And Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah follow the Book and the Sunnah, obey Allaah and His Messenger, they follow the truth and are merciful to the creation.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.2 ,1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DEFENDING THE RELIGION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> (d.241H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who, in every age and intervals between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge, who call the misguided to guidance, patiently bearing ill treatment and harm. With the Book of Allaah they give life to the dead, and by Allaah&#8217;s Light they give sight to the blind. How many a person killed by Iblees (the Devil) have they revived. How many people astray and wandering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They expel from the Book of Allaah the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones &#8211; those who uphold die banner of innovation and let loose the trials and discords; who differ about the Book, oppose the Book, and agree upon opposing the Book. They speak about Allaah and His Book without knowledge, argue about what is ambiguous in the Book, and deceive the ignorant masses with such ambiguities. We seek refuge in Allaah from the trials of the misguided ones.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When some people asked Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal that they felt uneasy about criticizing people, he replied: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;If I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant masses know the truth from falsehood?&#8221;</span> Those who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those who innovate in matters of worship, then it is obligatory that they be exposed and that the Muslims be warned against them &#8211; by unanimous agreement of the Muslims Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked about a person who fasted, preyed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship; if he was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against <i>ahlul-bid&#8217;ah</i> (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that openly opposing the innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the religion of Allaah and defending it from their attacks is a collective obligation &#8211; as is agreed upon by the Scholars. For Allaah did not raise up some people to oppose the innovators, then the religion would suffer harm, corruption and deviation. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater then the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. Since when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts, nor their religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>UNITING THE RANKS UPON THE TRUTH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect, ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not necessitate that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the rope of Allaah necessitates is: to order the good, forbid the evil and also to clarify the truth &#8211; with the clear <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs &#8211; to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221; [Sooratul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who shall be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;-lmraan 3:110]. And when the people of truth withhold from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his opposition. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying: &#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221; The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> have prohibited. Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one. Thus, if the difference involves a particular issue of ijtihaad wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a clear text of the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2] And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8220;</b> [Soorah at-Towbah 9:71]. And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.</b>&#8221; [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125]. And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do this, then with his tongue, and if he is unable to do this, then with his heart. And that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever directs a person to do good, will have a reward similar to the one who does that good.&#8221;</i> 5 And the <i>aayaat</i> (verses) and <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are plenty.&#8221; 6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Asaalah, Issue #21<br />
Translator: isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing the Muslim scholars do not differ about at all is the fact that Islaam is established upon two magnificent and great fundamental principles. Indeed they are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) worshipping only Allaah apart from others and<br />
2) following and taking our example from only the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) apart from others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what I want to discuss here only concerns the principle that states: A Muslim’s Eemaan does not become complete until he believes that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah. And that if any person on the face of this earth were to bear witness to Allaah’s Oneness according to the three categories (of Tawheed), then he will not be a believer until he adds to that his belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is His slave and messenger. So if it is this way, then it is required for every Muslim to learn the meaning of this beautiful statement (of Tawheed): <strong> “So know that Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah (there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah)” [Surah Muhammad: 19]</strong> and to acknowledge the true sense of its meaning in two parts. First, to believe in it and second, to put it into actuality in himself, his worship and his belief in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it is an obligation upon every Muslim to know the meaning of “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” This testimony (of bearing witness that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger) completes the first testimony (of bearing witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So due to this, the testimony (of Faith) does not become complete unless the Muslim believes in this (second) testimony &#8211; understanding, believing and accepting it firstly, and then applying it in the affairs of his life secondly. So our saying: “And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger” requires, among other things, that we believe that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) conveyed the message and that he carried out his task in its complete and perfect form, such that no one that comes after him, however high or elevated he may be, can correct or amend some part of it. Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, indicated this fact in his saying: <strong> &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8221; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is authentically reported on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) from numerous paths of narration that he said: <strong>“I have not left anything that will bring you closer to Allaah and distance you from the Hellfire, except that I have commanded you with it. And I have not left anything that will bring you closer to the Hellfire and distance you from Allaah except that I have forbade you from it.” </strong>So there has not been left any room for amending anything from it, whether it be a simple or a trivial thing being amended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is reported on the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah (Madeenah), Imaam Maalik Ibn Anas, may Allaah have mercy on him, that he said: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, which he deems is good, then he has claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has betrayed (the trust of conveying) the Message. Read the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic: &#8216;This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.&#8217; [Surat-ul-Maa’idah:3] So whatever was not (part of) the Religion on that day, is not (part of) the Religion on this day. And the last part of this ummah (nation) will not be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was from the understanding of Imaam Maalik, the Imaam of Daar-ul-Hijrah, such that he plainly stated in a clear Arabic language that whoever introduces into Islaam just one innovation and then claims that it is something good, he has in fact claimed that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) betrayed the Message. And whoever makes this claim, he does not believe (truly) that “Muhammad is His slave and messenger.” As is very clear in the words of this noble Imaam, it (the innovation) is “not (part of) the Religion on this day.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to implement his Ittibaa’ (following of the Prophet), such that he could be truthful in (his declaration that) Muhammad, Allaah’s Messenger, is His slave and messenger. And that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) brought the complete and pure message, without adding to it or subtracting from it. If this is the case, then every Muslim must acknowledge his extent and stop at the points where his Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has placed limits for him, such as the acts of worship and deeds of obedience (to Allaah). This is because the pen has dried with what was revealed previously (i.e. no more revelation after Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). And there was no room left open to approve of an act of worship that didn’t exist previously in the first days (i.e. of the Prophet). Consequently, our pious predecessors (Salaf As-Saalih) have come and gone all acknowledging the extent of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in that he first fulfilled his mission and conveyed the Message, as you know. And (second) that he was the best worshipper amongst Allaah’s worshippers and the most fearing of Allaah. So there is no room to correct him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the standpoint of legislating (revealed matters) into the Religion, as you have heard the ayah and Imaam Maailk’s comments about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Such that it can be claimed that there is someone who is a better worshipper and more worshipping (of Allaah) than Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever understands these two facts, which are related to one’s belief that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) is Allaah’s slave and messenger, he will limit the worship he performs for Allaah to only that which has been reported on the Prophet (in the ahaadeeth). And he will not put any example or role model before him other than the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). Nor will he ever claim this second point, meaning it is impossible that it can get into the mind of any believer that he is more dutiful to Allaah or more fearing of Allaah or more worshipping of Allaah than him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is something impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will mention what has been reported in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik (raa) that a group of people went to see the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) but asked his wives because they were not able to find him. So they asked his wives about the Prophet’s worship – about his standing in prayer at night, his fasting during the day and about his relations with his wives. So they mentioned to them what they knew about his guidance regarding that &#8211; and his guidance is the best guidance on the face of this earth as is stated in the khutbah al-Haajah: <strong>“And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.”</strong> The wives of the Prophet mentioned to these men that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would fast and break his fast, and that he would pray at night and also sleep and that he would marry women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (raa) said: “When they heard that from the wives of the Prophet, they found his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) worship to be little.&#8221; They thought it to be little because of what had settled in their minds that the Prophet must pray the whole night and that he must fast all the time and that he was a monk and did not go near his wives. So they were shocked to find something that was not in compliance with their notions. So they assumed that the reason for this was because Allaah had forgiven all of the Prophet&#8217;s past and future sins. So it is as if they said: “The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) only minimized in his worship &#8211; which they thought to be little &#8211; because Allaah had forgiven his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there wasn&#8217;t left any obstacle preventing him from increasing in the worship of his Lord.” This was a mistake on their part without a doubt. This is since they didn’t know that this worship which they thought to be little, was in fact worship that could not be fulfilled by even the best worshipper amongst mankind, not even Dawood (as) about whom it is authentically reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong> “Dawood was the best worshipper amongst mankind.” </strong>This group of people did not know that the Prophet was the best worshipper amongst mankind with this worship (of his) and that not even the best worshipper amongst mankind was able to perform his worship, as I have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was from the things that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) was asked about when some people – who were well aware of his habits not like that group of people that was ignorant of his habits – found him, and they felt compassion for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), because they saw him standing in prayer until his feet had become swollen. So they said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins.” They meant by this: “Have pity on yourself, O Messenger of Allaah! Be easy in the worship, for your feet have become swollen.&#8221; And his response was: <strong> &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the false reasoning employed by that small band of people, who said the reason for the Prophet&#8217;s little worship was because Allaah had forgiven his past and future sins. They were not aware that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would stand in night prayer until his feet would become swollen. So when it was said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah! Allaah has forgiven your past and future sins”, he responded: &#8220;Should I not then be a grateful servant?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Basing on what they imagined was little worship on the part of the Prophet and what they knew of Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins, each person in this small group assumed that they were obligated to exceed in worship and that they must surpass what they heard about the Prophet&#8217;s worship with regard to his fasting, praying at night and relations with women. So they made the following pledges to themselves: The first person said &#8220;I will pray all night and won&#8217;t sleep.&#8221; The second one said: &#8220;As for me, I will fast all the time and never go a day without fasting.&#8221; And the third person said: &#8220;I will not marry women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why? Because they assumed that marriage was a distraction and turned one away from perfecting one&#8217;s worship to Allaah. But they did not know &#8211; and Allaah knows best but it seem to me that they were new (reverts) to Islaam who did not learn yet of the Commands and Rulings of Islaam &#8211; that marriage was itself worship, as is found in the famous hadeeth, when a group of poor people came to the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The people with much wealth and income have surpassed us &#8211; they pray like we pray, they fast like we fast, and they make Hajj like we make Hajj. And they give money in charity but we don&#8217;t give away anything in charity!&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Shall I not direct you to something, which if you do, you will surpass those in front of you and those behind you will never be able catch up to you (in reward), except for those who do the same as you?&#8221; So the representative of the poor people went back to his companions among the poor folk and related to them the good news that came from the Prophet. So they became very happy at hearing it. However, it was not long before their representative went to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger again to tell him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! What you told us was conveyed to the rich folk and so they have begun to do what we are doing.&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;That is the bounty of Allaah, which He gives to whom He pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the narration of Imaam Muslim found in his Saheeh. In another narration of the hadeeth, it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said to them: &#8220;Verily in every tasbeehah (saying SubhanAllaah) there is charity for you. And in every tahmeedah (saying Al-Hamdulillaah) there is charity. And in every takbeerah (saying Allaahu Akbar) there is charity. And in every tahleelah (saying Bismillaah) there is charity. Commanding good is charity and forbidding evil is charity. And removing a harmful obstacle from the road is charity.&#8221; Then the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) continued to mention many noble characteristics. Then he said at the end of the hadeeth: <strong> &#8220;And in your having relations with your wife, there is charity.&#8221;</strong> They said in amazement: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, will one of us fulfill his desire (with his wife) and get rewarded for that?&#8221; So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;Don’t you see that if one fulfills it in a forbidden way, that he will have a burden (of sin) for it?&#8221; They said: &#8220;Of course, O Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So he said: <strong> &#8220;Then likewise, if he fulfills it in a lawful way he will be rewarded for it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were not aware of the likes of this hadeeth and other hadeeths in which there is found an incitement to get married and especially in producing children and progeny, as is reported in the authentic hadeeth: &#8220;Marry the fertile and loving woman, for indeed I will compete with other nations by you, as regards to who has the most followers, on the Day of Judgement.&#8221; So the one who marries and keeps himself chaste and keeps his wife chaste, he will be rewarded for that. This group was ignorant about this, so there was one among them who made a pledge binding on himself that he would not marry, saying: &#8220;As for me, I will not marry women.&#8221; Then that group left and when the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) returned home, his wives informed him of what they heard from that group of people and the pledges they made to themselves. So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) gave a khutbah about this in his masjid, saying: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; (?) &#8211; repeating to the audience what these individuals who came to his house had said. &#8220;This last person will not marry women. The second said he would fast everyday and not go a day without fasting. And the other one said that he will pray all night and not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it was from the Prophet&#8217;s etiquettes when admonishing, reprimanding and teaching the people that he would hide the faults of those who committed errors or sinned (by not mentioning their names). So he would not expose them but rather make such statements like the one you just read above: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with these people who say such and such?&#8221; This is because there is no benefit in mentioning the (name of the) person who erred, unless his error involves a large group of people and he is present (for the reminder). But if the people leave and he leaves, the opportunity for reminding them goes away. So in this situation, one must mention that to the people publicly. And it is not like that which is thought by some people who know about wisdom and gentleness when commanding good and forbidding evil, for they do not realize that gentleness does not nullify manifesting the criticism of one who errs if his error involves a group of people. The stories of our Salaf (predecessors), all praise be to Allaah, are filled with reports bearing witness to this fact. It is sufficient for me to just mention what the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) reported in their Saheehs from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, rady Allaahu &#8216;anhu, was giving the Friday khutbah &#8211; naturally in the Prophet&#8217;s masjid &#8211; when a man from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger entered &#8211; and in one narration it states that it was &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan. So &#8216;Umar stopped his khutbah and turned towards this person that had come late and had missed coming early to hear the dhikr and to hear the Jumu&#8217;ah khutah. So the man responded, saying: &#8216;O Commander of the Believers, I did not do anything except hear the Adhaan, make wudoo and then come to the masjid.&#8217; So he said to him reprimanding him in a disapproving interrogating manner: &#8216;The wudoo also, for I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) say: Whoever goes to (pray) Jumu&#8217;ah, then he should take ghusl (bath).'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we derive from this report is that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) reprimanded &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan publicly in front of a large gathering of witnesses because he came late to the Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah and prayer. So therefore: The principle of teaching and reminding someone is based on the foundation of: Hiding the faults of people, unless there is a benefit that requires that it be done in public. This is the principle that the Messenger of Allaah implemented when he gave the khutbah regarding that group of people that had come to his house. So he said: &#8220;What is wrong with these people who say such and such&#8221; making an indication of them but not naming anyone of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;As for me…&#8221;, which is a refutation of the essence of what was stated by those people who claimed the reason that the Prophet, had little worship was due to Allaah having forgiven his past and future sins. So he said: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast&#8221; &#8211; meaning I don&#8217;t fast all the time. &#8220;And I pray at night and I also sleep&#8221; &#8211; meaning I do not stay up the whole night, as is done by those extremists amongst worshippers who increase and try to surpass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This is why &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said, as is recorded in Saheeh Muslim: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) never stayed up a whole night in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, reminding us that the Religion is moderation and that worhsip is moderation &#8211; neither exaggeration nor negligence: &#8220;As for me, then I am the most fearing amongst you of Allaah, and the most dutiful amongst you towards Allaah. As for me, then indeed I fast and I don&#8217;t fast. And I pray at night and I also sleep. And I marry women. So whoever turns away from my Sunnah then he is not from me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as it came to us from Islaam, is that which all the Muslims are obligated to adhere to. And I guarantee that if Dawood, who was the best worshipper amongst mankind according to the testimony of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, came after the Prophet&#8217;s being sent with this complete and perfect Islaam, he would not be able to encompass doing all of the Prophet&#8217;s acts of worship. This means all of the acts of worship that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger brought whether through speech, actions or silent approval. Due to this, there remain no grounds for any Muslim to add an act of worship after Allaah completed His Religion by sending His Prophet with this perfect Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after realizing that the Prophet is the best worshipper amongst mankind and the most dutiful and fearing of Allaah amongst them, there should not be anything but following of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). We are upon certainty that we will never be able to encompass the worship of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, except for occasionally or at brief periods of time. So we are completely incapable of following and tracing the footsteps of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in his worship. This is impossible &#8211; with respect to every individual amongst mankind after the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there remains nothing before us except that we all strive for two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To learn the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger in all matters that came to us from Islaam &#8211; whether in Creed or in Worship or in characteristics and manners. And as I said before, we will never be able to do more than just imitate him, as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So imitate (them) if you are not like them,<br />
Verily, imitating the righteous ones is success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not for us to imitate anyone amongst mankind except him, because he is the most perfect of humans according to unanimous agreement. And everyone that imitates him after he has gone will be overwhelmed by his ocean of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. This is the first thing &#8211; that we must know the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger according to the wide and extensive meaning. This is since the Prophet&#8217;s saying concerning that group of people: &#8220;So whoever turns away from my Sunnah, then he is not from me&#8221;, this sentence in this general hadeeth does not refer to the abandonment of the recommended sunnah acts, for example, that this person is not from the Prophet. This is not what is meant by the hadeeth. Rather, the meaning of the hadeeth is: &#8220;Whoever turns away from my Sunnah&#8221; meaning from my Way and from my Methodology in all affairs of my religious life. This is the kind of person that is not from him. And this kind of person varies with regard to his remoteness from following the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah has two meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A religious Arabic language-based one, and it is that which the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and those who followed his way were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That which has occurred in the custom of the Fuqahaa in dividing the worship into two types &#8211; Fard (Obligation) and Sunnah (Recommended). The Sunnah here according to their definition of it is: &#8220;That which the one who does it will be rewarded for and which the one who abandons it will not be punished for.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person that abandons the Messenger&#8217;s Sunnah, with its first meaning &#8211; i.e. his way and methodology &#8211; then this person is in misguidance. And his deviance can either be large or little depending on his closeness or remoteness to following Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). So based on this, we should find ourselves as having no need for amending and introducing a &#8220;good innovation&#8221; (bid&#8217;ah hasanah) into Islaam, claiming that there is nothing wrong with this innovation. This is because we should find ourselves as falling short and being incapable of following the noble Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) in everything that has been reported to us concerning his worship, whether it is related to supplications, remembrances or prayers. So it is sufficient for us to just follow him, according to our abilities. Here, I would like to mention a story reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh so that you can realize the worth of Allaah&#8217;s saying: ”This day I have completed your Religion for you, and I have perfected My favor upon you, and I am pleased with Islaam as a Religion for you.” [Surat-ul-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree reported that one of the Jewish Rabbis went to &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab during the time of his Khilaafah and said to him: &#8220;O Commander of the Believers! There is an ayah in the Book of Allaah that if it had been revealed unto us &#8211; a gathering of Jews &#8211; we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid (holiday).&#8221; So he asked: &#8220;Which ayah is it?&#8221; So the Rabbi mentioned the ayah: &#8220;This day I have completed your Religion for you…&#8221; So &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;This ayah was indeed revealed on a day of &#8216;Eid, on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah while the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was in &#8216;Arafaat (meaning in his farewell pilgrimage). So this ayah was indeed sent down on a very great day in which there is a combination of two virtues and two &#8216;Eids &#8211; the &#8216;Eid of Jumu&#8217;ah and the &#8216;Eid of &#8216;Arafaat.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did this Jew say: &#8220;Had it been revealed unto us, we would have taken the day it was revealed as a day of &#8216;Eid?&#8221; It is because he was aware of the greatness of this blessing, which Allaah bestowed upon His servants. But what about us Muslims today? Unfortunately, we do not give this great blessing its due weight in worth. This is why you find many people in the past &#8211; in previous generations &#8211; who have filled the Muslims with prayers, words of remembrance and supplications that the Prophet did not come with. What has come to us from the Prophet is truly sufficient and adequate, in fact it is more than our human capabilities can grasp. However, each one of us takes from this worship what he is able to and what conforms to his capability and capacity.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Innovations of Hajj, Umrah and visiting Medina</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I decided to add an appendix, setting forth the innovations regarding Hajj and visiting Madinat-ul-Munawwara, and Bait-ul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) (118) as many people do not know these things and so fall into them &#8211; so I wished to advise them by explaining and warning them against these things &#8211; as Allaah the Blessed and Exalted does not accept any action unless it fulfils two conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: That it done sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Honored, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: That it is correct &#8211; and it is not correct until it is in accordance with the Sunnah, not at variance with it &#8211; and as the people of knowledge have agreed &#8211; everything claimed by the people to be part of worship which Rasoolullah did not prescribe by his saying, nor drew nearer to Allaah by performing it &#8211; then that is at variance with his Sunnah as his Sunnah is of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Sunnah of action (Sunnah Fi&#8217;liyyah &#8211; actions which he did) and<br />
(b) Sunnah of neglect (Sunnah Tarkiyyah) &#8211; acts which he did not do)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those things pertain to worship, the Prophet did not do &#8211; then it is from the Sunnah to leave them &#8211; for example: calling Adhaan for the &#8216;Eid prayers and for burying the dead, even though it is a means of making mentioning of Allaah and glorifying Him, it is not permissible do it as a means of drawing nearer to Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious &#8211; and that is only because it is something which Rasoolullah refrained from doing &#8211; and this point was understood by his companions &#8211; so they often warred against innovation in general &#8211; as is mentioned in its proper place &#8211; and Hudhaufah ibn al Yamaan (ra) said: &#8220;Every worship that has not been done by the companions of Rasoolullah, then do not do it.&#8221; And Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (ra)said: &#8220;Follow (the Sunnah) and do not innovate, and that is enough for you &#8211; stick to the old way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how fortunate is the one to whom Allaah gives the good fortune of making his worship sincerely for Him and following of the Sunnah of His Prophet (sas) in it &#8211; not mixing it with innovation &#8211; for such a one then let him have good tidings of Allaah&#8217;s acceptance of his obedience &#8211; and his admission to His Paradise. May Allah make us those who bear the word and follow the best of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should know that these innovations are traceable to the following factors:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Weak (da&#8217;eef) Ahaadith &#8211; which are not permitted to be used as evidence, nor is it, according to your saying, permissible to act on them &#8211; as I have explained in the introduction of &#8216;Sifat-Salaat un-Nabee&#8217; (The Prophet&#8217;s Manner of Prayer) &#8211; and this is the position of a group of the people of knowledge &#8211; from them Ibn Taimiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Fabricated (maudoo&#8217;) Ahaadith &#8211; or narrations which have no basis &#8211; some scholars remaining unaware of their true nature &#8211; and therefore basing religious verdicts upon them &#8211; their being the core of innovation and novelties!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The decisions of some scholars or their regarding certain things to be commendable &#8211; especially the later scholars &#8211; not basing these on any proofs (from the Qur&#8217;an of Sunnah), rather treating them as indisputable matters &#8211; until they become Sunnahs adhered to and followed. And it will not remain hidden from one who has insight into his religion &#8211; that it is not correct to follow such things -as nothing is part of the Sharee&#8217;ah except what Allaah has prescribed &#8211; and it is enough for the one who makes something desirable &#8211; if he is mujtahid &#8211; that it is permissible for him to act according to what he sees as desirable &#8211; and that Allaah will not punish him for that &#8211; But as for other people taking that as something prescribed and as Sunnah &#8211; then not definitely not! And how can that be when some of these things conflict with the Sunnah &#8211; as will be noted later of Allaah wills?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) Customs and superstitions which have no evidence from the Sharee&#8217;ah, and are not even supported by the intellect &#8211; even if some ignorant people act upon them and take them to be part of the sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; sometimes finding support from others &#8211; sometimes from some people claiming to be from the people of knowledge &#8211; and actually having their appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you should know that the danger of these innovations is not of one level &#8211; rather they are of different degrees. Some of them being clear shirk and kufr &#8211; as you will see, and some of them are less than that &#8211; however, you must be aware that the slightest innovation that someone brings into the religion is haraam (forbidden) after it is exposed as an innovation &#8211; as there is no innovation that is only makrooh (disapproved), as some people think &#8211; and how can that be when Rasoolullah (sas) said: &#8220;Every innovation is a going astray. And every going astray is in the Fire&#8221;. That is the one who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam ash-Shaatibee has fully explained this point in his important book &#8216;Al I&#8217;tisaam&#8217; &#8211; and because of this the innovation is something very dangerous &#8211; and most people remain heedless of this, except for a small group of the people of knowledge and enough as a proof of the seriousness of innovation is the saying of the Prophet : &#8220;Verily Allah has refused to admit the repentance of anyone committing an innovation, until he gives up the innovation&#8221;. Narrated by Tabraanee and ad-Diyaa-ul-Maqdisee in &#8216;al Ahaadith ul-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others &#8211; with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and was declared by al-Mundharee to be hasan. (119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I complete this with word of advice which I convey to the readers from a great Imaam from the first scholars of the Muslims &#8211; Shaikh Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali al Barbahaaree &#8211; one of the companions of Imaam Ahmad &#8211; and died in the year 329 H, he &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: &#8220;And beware of the smallest of the newly-invented matters, as the small innovations due to repetition become large innovations, and in that way every innovation introduced in this Ummah began as a small innovation &#8211; resembling something correct and thus is the one who falls into it enticed &#8211; then he is not able to leave it &#8211; some of it grows and becomes part of the religion, practiced as such. So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; everything that people of your time say and do not made haste (in accepting it) until you ask and find out: Did any of the companions of the Prophet or any of the people of knowledge speak about it? So if you find a narration from the, then accept it and do not leave it for anything &#8211; and do not prefer anything- and do not prefer anything over it and thus fall into the Fire. And you should know &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; that a worshipper&#8217;s Islaam is not complete until he is follower (of proof), consenting and submitting (to the Truth). So whoever claims that anything remains of Islaam which the companions of Rasoolullah did not fully explain to us &#8211; then he has invented a lie against them, and that is enough for him that he has reviled them &#8211; so he is an innovator, misguided and misguiding, introducing into Islaam what does not belong to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Al-Albaani) say : And may Allah have mercy upon Imaam Maalik who said : &#8220;The last part of this Ummah will not be corrected except by that which corrected its beginning, so that which was not part of the religion then &#8211; is not part of the religion today.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allah send blessing upon our Prophet (sas) who said : &#8220;I have not left any thing that will draw you nearer to Allah &#8211; except that I have enjoined it upon you. And I have not left anything that will take you away from Allah and draw you to the Fire except that I have forbidden it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah by Whose blessing Good actions are completed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is included as undertaking journey to the Prophet&#8217;s mosque and Masjid ul-Aqsaa &#8211; may Allah return it to the Muslims soon &#8211; is from the Sunnah and because of the benefits and rewards for this, and people usually visit them before or after making Hajj &#8211; and many of them fall into numerous innovations well-known to the scholars, while doing that &#8211; so I saw it beneficial to include what I have across from these as a notification and warning and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">132. Journeying to visit the Prophet&#8217;s grave. (129)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">144. Ibn al-Hajj&#8217;s saying in &#8220;al-Madkhal&#8221; (1/259) that: &#8220;One should not mention with his tongues his needs or need forgiveness of sins when visiting the grave of the Prophet&#8221; because he knows his needs already and what is of benefit to him!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">145. His saying also (1/364): &#8220;There is no difference between his death and life &#8211; as regards his watching over his Ummah and their affairs and intentions, and their regrets and their thoughts&#8221;!!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">148. Adopting a particular way for visiting the Prophet and his two companions &#8211; and a particular way of giving salaam and making du&#8217;aa, like the saying of Al-Ghazzali: &#8220;He should stand next to the face of the Prophet with his back to the Qiblah, and face the wall of the tomb &#8230; and say.. &#8220;mentioning a long salaam then a long salaat and du&#8217;aa reaching about three pages.

<p style="text-align:justify;">172. They claim that the Siraat (Bridge) and the Scales (meezan) are there, and that the wall that will be placed between the people of Pradise and the people of the Fire is the wall built to the east of the mosque.</p>

I ask Allaah the Blessed and Most High to make it an aid to the Muslims in giving preference to and following the example of the best of the Messengers and accepting his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">2. As is the case with most pilgrims these days &#8211; and it is very rare for one of them to bring the sacrificial animal along with him as the Prophet did. So he who does so, then there is no blame upon him &#8211; however one who does not bring it with him and still does Hajj Qaarin or Faarid &#8211; then he has gone against the Prophet&#8217;s action and his command &#8211; even though the people may be averse to this point. As Ibn Abbas said- reported by Muslim(4/58) and AHmad(1/278,342).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">4. And his basis for saying that is the saying of the Prophet: Verily Allaah has entered the &#8216;Umrah into this Hajj of yours, so when you come &#8211; then he who has made tawaaf of the House and between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; then he has become Halaal(left iHraam) except he who had the sacrificial animal with him.(Sahih A.D., nos.1573,1580).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">5. And that does not negate what is narrated from &#8216;Umar and others that Hajj Muffrad is better because of what I have stated in the Original.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">8. It is the face-cover worn upon the tip of the nose. And it is of different types. If she pulls it up to her eyes then it is called &#8216;Al-Waswasah&#8217; or &#8216;Al-Burqa&#8217;. If she pulls it down to below the eye socket then it is &#8216;Al-Niqaab&#8217;, and if it is upon the end of her nose it is &#8216;Al-Lukfaam&#8217;. It is called the woman&#8217;s niqaab because it hides her colour of the niqaab (Lisaan ul &#8216;Arab 2/265-266).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">10. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in his &#8216;Mansik&#8217;: &#8220;And he should not cut them down to below the ankle, as the Prophet ordered with this to begin with, then made allowance for not doing do in &#8216;Arafaat, when allowed one not finding an izaar to wear trousers, and allowing one who does not find sandals to wear leather socks(khuff).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">42. Al-Idtibaa&#8217; is bid&#8217;ah before this tawaaf, and after it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">43. Abu Dawud and others. Authenticated by many scholars. See Saheeh Abi Dawud,(no.1653).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">44. Shaikh ul Islaam ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;As for the other parts of the House, and the Place of Ibraheem, and whatever is in the rest of the world mosques and their walls, and the graves of the prophets and good people &#8211; like the room of our Prophet, and cave of Ibraheem, and the place where our Prophet used to pray &#8211; and all other such places, and the rock at Jerusalem, then none of these are to be touched at all or kissed &#8211; by total agreement of the scholars. And as for tawaaf of these things &#8211; then it is one of the greatest and most forbidden bid&#8217;ahs &#8211; and he who takes that as part of his religion should be asked to repent &#8211; and if he refuses he killed&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">And &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (no.8945) and AHmad and al-Baihaqi port from Ya&#8217;laa ibn Umayyah who said: &#8220;I made tawaaf with Umar ibn ul-Khattaab ( and in a narration: with &#8216;Uthuzza) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; so when I came to the corner of the Door I started to touch it so he said &#8216;Have you not made tawaaf with Rasoolullaah?&#8217; I said: Yes. He said: &#8216;Then did you see him touch it?&#8217; I said: No. He said: &#8216;Then do likewise for there is for you in Rasoolullah a good example'&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">45. This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138. And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">46. At-Tirmidhee and others, and the other narration is Tabraanis. And it is Saheeh: See also &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.21). Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;And there is no particular dhikr narrated from the Prophet, not by his order, or his saying, or by his teaching, rather he should make du&#8217;aa with any authentic du&#8217;aas &#8211; and the particular du&#8217;aas which many people mention like that for below the water-spout, etc. &#8211; there is no basis for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">47. Bukharee and Muslim from Abu Hurairah, and Tirmidhee from &#8216;Alee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1102)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">48. Bukharee and Muslim from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, and Bukharee from Jaabir &#8211; and the addition is his. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.191).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">49. See the Introduction and the Original Book, (pp.21,23 and 135).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">50. Saheeh hadith &#8211; as a number of scholars have said. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1123) and &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">51. Saheeh hadith narrated by at-Tayaalisee and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">52. Narrated by &#8216;ad-Diyaa&#8217; in &#8216;Al-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">53. It is not easy these days to see the Ka&#8217;bah except from certain points on as-Safa; it can be seen from the pillar which supports the second storey of the mosque, so he who is able to do so has attained the Sunnah, and if not then let him try his best and there is no harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">54. (An-Nawawi) adds in &#8216;Al-Adhkaar&#8217;: Laa ilaaha illallaahu walaa na&#8217;budu illaa iyyaahu, and I do not find this addition in any narration of the hadith- either Muslim or anyone else who records the hadith&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">55. That is after the tahleels &#8211; making du&#8217;aa for whatever he wishes from the good of this world and the Hereafter &#8211; and the best thing is that it should be something reported from the Prophet or the pious predecessors (ssalaf ul-Saalih).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">56. And contrary to what some mistakenly say it is a sahih hadith. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1072).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">57. Reported by an-Nasaa&#8217;ee and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Hajj ul-Kabeer. Note:The following text appears in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;of Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee (3/394): &#8220;And all the woman&#8217;s tawaaf and sa&#8217;ee is done walking, Ibn al-Mundhir says: Scholars are agreed that there is no reaml(walking quickly) upon the women around the Ka&#8217;bah or between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; nor uncovering the right shoulder (idtibaa&#8217;). And that is because the principle of it is uncovering the skin &#8211; and that is not desired from women &#8211; what is required from them is to cover &#8211; and in walking quickly (raml) and idtibaa&#8217; uncovering occurs.&#8221; And in &#8216;Al-Majmoo&#8217; of an-Nawawee(8/75) there appears what shows that there is difference of opinion in the matter between the Shafi&#8217;i scholars, he says:&#8221; There are two sayings in that. Firstly, and this is correct upon which the Jumhoor (majority) of scholars agree: That she should not run at all &#8211; but walk whether in the night or day. Secondly, that it is mutahabb for her to run at night when there is no one around (to see her) in the place of running &#8211; just as for men.&#8221; I (Al-Albanee) say: &#8220;And perhaps that is more cprrect &#8211; as the origin of sa&#8217;ee (running) is the sa&#8217;ee of Haajar mother of Imaa&#8217;eel &#8211; seeking water for her thirsty son as occurs in the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas: &#8220;And she found as-Safaa to be the nearest hill to her so she stood upon it, then turned towards the river-bed to see if she could see anyone &#8211; so she went down from as-Safaa till she reached the river-bed, raising up the border of her dress &#8211; and running fast till she crossed the river-bed then she came to Marwah and stood upon it to see if she could see anyone, and she could not see anyone &#8211; and she did that seven times. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: The Prophet said:&#8217;And that is the sa&#8217;ee of the people between these two'&#8221;. (Narrated by Bukharee in the Book of the Prophets)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">58. As for seeing the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it is not possible now because of the building between it and the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; so should try his best to face the Ka&#8217;bah and not do as the confused people do, who raise up their eyes and hands to the sky!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">59. Narrated by Abu Nu&#8217;aim in his &#8216;Mustakhraj of Sahih Muslim&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">60. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaibah(4/68.69) from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; May Allah be pleased with them &#8211; with two sahih isnaads. And from Al-Musayyib ibn Raafi&#8217; al-Kaahilee and &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair. And at-Tabraani narrates it from the Prophet but its isnaad is da&#8217;eef (weak) &#8211; &#8216;Al-Mujmi'(3/248).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">61. Or shaves it if there is sufficient time between his &#8216;Umrah and Hajj for his hair to grow enough (see Fath ul Baari,3/444).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">62. Narrated by Bukharee and Muslim</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">63. 64. 63,64. This stopping and that after it may be difficult to perform these days due to the crowd of people, so if he goes past it to &#8216;Arafah then it is alright insh&#8217;allah. Shaikh ul Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in &#8216;al-Fataawaa&#8217; (26:128): As for that which is from the sunnah of Rasoolullah &#8211; staying in Minaa on Yaum -ut-Tarwiyyah and for that night, then stopping at &#8216;Urahah&#8217;, which is between the Mash&#8217;ar ul Haraam and going from there to &#8216;Arafah, and the giving of Khutbah and the two prayers on the way in the middle of &#8216;Uranah&#8217;- then this is as agreed upon by scholars &#8211; whereas many writers do not bring it to notice &#8211; and most people do not know due to the prevalence of invented practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">65. I say: &#8220;And also it is not reported that the Prophet prayed anything before Zuhr or after &#8216;Asr in this place &#8211; or in any of his journeys &#8211; and it is not established that he prayed any supplementary prayers in any of his journeys except the two sunnahs of Fajr and the Witr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">66. Bukharee narrates it from Ibn &#8216;Umar with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. See &#8216;Mukhtasar-al-Bukhari'(3/89/25).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">67. Hasan or Sahih hadith. With more than one isnaad &#8211; refer to &#8216;As-Saheehah,(no.1503)&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">68. As that is established from the Prophet &#8211; as is explained in the Original.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">69. Narrated by Muslim and others. See &#8216;At-Targheeb'(2/129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">70. Narrated by AHmad and others &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;Takhreej ut-Targheeb&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">71. This was said ny Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, its being established from the Prophet and his companions, in al-Bukhari (25/94/801) (Mukhtasar al-Bukhari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">72. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And when he reaches Muzdalifah he prays Maghrib before making the camels kneel down if possible, then after making them kneel they pray &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; and if they delay the &#8216;Ishaa somewhat then there is no harm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">73. As for the addition &#8220;Allahummaj&#8217;alhu Hajjan mabrooran&#8230;.&#8221; which some writers mention &#8211; it is not established from the Prophet as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Daee&#8217;fah&#8217; (no.1107).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">74. Narrated in Ibn Khuzaimah&#8217;s &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; &#8211; where he says: Hadith saheeh, and explaining with this narration what is unclear in others and that what is intended by &#8216;until he stoned Jamrat ul &#8216;Aqabah&#8217; is &#8216;finished stoning it&#8217; (Fath ul Baaree, no.1426).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">75. And this point has been fully explained in the Original &#8211; so refer to that if you wish to receive the proof of the matter (p.30).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">76. And this hadith is sahih and has been authenticated by a number of scholars, from among them Ibn ul Qayyim, as I have explained in &#8216;Sahih Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1745). And when some of the distinguished scholars came upon this hadith before the spread of this treatise- they regarded it as something strange &#8211; some of them quickly declaring it to be weak &#8211; as I myself did in some of my earlier works &#8211; based upon Abu Dawud&#8217;s isnaad &#8211; eventhough Ibn ul Qayyim strengthened it in his &#8216;Tahdheeb&#8217; of Abi Dawud, and as did Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) in &#8216;At-Talkhees&#8217; &#8211; by keeping silent about it. And I have found other chains of narration for it which will convince anyone looking into the matter of its being raised from the level of da&#8217;eef to level of its being saheeh. However due to there being in a reference work not in common use by the large majority &#8211; and that is Imaam at-Tahaawis &#8216;Sharh Ma&#8217;aanee ul &#8216;Athaar&#8217;- these people quickly declared its something strange or being da&#8217;eef and they were encouraged in this by the fact that they found that some of the earlier scholars had said: &#8216;And I do not know any scholar who has ruled according to that.&#8217; And that is a negation of something &#8211; it is not a piece of definite known amongst the scholars that lack of knowledge of something does not mean absence of knowledge of it. So when a hadith is established to have come from Rasoolullah and is a relevant proof &#8211; as this is &#8211; then it is obligatory to act upon it straight away, not waiting to see if the scholars know of it or not, just as Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee said &#8220;A narration is to be accepted as soon as it is confirmed even if none of the scholars are acting upon it like the narrations which they accept &#8211; for the hadith of Rasoolullah is confirmed on its own not by anyone&#8217;s acting on it afterwards.&#8221; I say: So the hadith of Rasoolullah is above needing to be attested to by the actions of scholars according to it, as it is a source (of knowledge) by itself, judging not being judged. And along with that, indeed, some of the scholars have acted upon this particular hadith &#8211; from them &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair &#8211; the greatest Taabi&#8217;ee &#8211; so can there remain any excuse for anyone to leave action according to this hadith: So verily therein is a warning for any who have a perceptive heart or listens attentively. And this is more fully explained in the Original. And you should be aware that the stoning of the Jamrah is for the pilgrims as the &#8216;Eid prayer for the rest of the people, therefore, Imaam AHmad liked that the time for the &#8216;Eid prayer in different parts should be that of the time of sacrifice in Minaa, And the Prophet gave Khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice after the stoning just as he used to give the Khutbah in Madinah after &#8216;Eid prayer &#8211; so some people holding it as being desirable to offer &#8216;Eid prayer in Minaa, taking as their evidence the word of general profs or analogy &#8211; is a mistake and neglect of the Sunnah &#8211; As neither the Prophet nor the khulafaa after him ever prayed the &#8216;Eid prayer at Minaa. See &#8216;Fatawaa Ibn Taimiyyah'(26:180).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">77. I say: And there is in this hadith two great allowancesfor the pilgrims &#8211; and a solution for most of the problems of the piling up of slaughtered animals in the slaughter- house &#8211; which has led to those in control there to have to bury some in the earth &#8211; and he who wishes to see the matter more fully laid out should return to the Original (pp.82-988).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">78. And there is a hadith from the Prophet narrated by Jaabir &#8211; reported by Abu Dawud and others &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa'(no.1138) and another by Baihaqee (9/289). And it is narrated from Ibn &#8216;Umar that he liked the animal to be made to face the Qiblah when slaughtered. And Abdur-Razzaaq(no.8585) narrates with sahih isnaad from ibn &#8216;Umar, that he disliked to eat from an animal slaughtered facing other than the Qiblah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">79. Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) says (10/16): &#8220;That it will be easier for the one slaughtering to take the knife in his right hand, and to hold its head with his left.&#8221; I say: And causing it to die down and placing the foot on its side is what is narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">80. Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1550). And there is after it a supporting hadith from Ibn&#8217;Umar like it &#8211; narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">81. Narrated by Maalik with sahih isnaad reaching Ibn &#8216;Umar and Bukharee brings it in a chapter heading while signifying its authenticity Mukhtasar of Bukharee no.330).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">82. Reported by Abu Dawud and others narrated by Jaabir &#8211; and it has support from the hadith of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al Khudnee reported by Abu Ya&#8217;laa &#8211; as occurs in &#8216;al-Majma&#8217; (4/22) &#8211; see &#8220;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1118).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">83. Reported by Muslim and others from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa&#8217; &#8211; and Ibn Taimiyyah in his book &#8216;Al-Mansik&#8217; added: &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..(As You accepted from Ibrahim whom You took as a chosen friend)&#8221;, and I cannot find it in any of the books of Sunnah which are with me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">84. Reported by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad (see Glossary). Its isnaad is joined by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1700,1701).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">85. Reported by AHmad, authenticated by Ibn Hibbaan, and I hold it to be authentic due to its multiple lines of transmission. See &#8216;As-Saheehah'(no.2476).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">86. Al Qaani&#8217; is the one who asks. And Al Mu&#8217;tarr is the one who begs by displaying the weakness of his body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">87. Narrated by Bukharee and others. See &#8216;Irwa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.964). As for Ibn Taimiyyah&#8217;s saying (p.388) &#8220;And the Mutamatti&#8217; must fast part of the three days before putting of the iHraam for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyya&#8221; &#8211; I do not know any proof for it. Rather it seems to go against the clear meaning of the ayah and hadith, and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">88. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1084).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">89. Reported by Muslim and others, see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1089), and Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1730). And this is one of those matters in which Ibn al Hammaam the Hanaafi scholar agrees that the Hanaafi scholars have gone against the Sunnah. So what have the blind followers to say of that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">90. Sahih hadith &#8211; &#8216;Al Ahaadith us-Saheehah&#8217; (no.605), Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1732).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">91. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And if he shortens it he draws it together and shortens it up to the length of a finger joint or less &#8211; or more, and the woman does not shorten in excess of that &#8211; as for the man he may shorten it as much as he pleases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">92. Report by Bukharee and Abu Dawud from a number of the companions &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1705,1707,1709,1710) and &#8216;Mukhtasar ul-Bukharee&#8217; (no.847).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">93. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad &#8211; connected by Abu Dawud. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1700) and &#8216;Irwaa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.1064).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">94. 95. 94,95. Narrated by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1710)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">96. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Ibn Abi Shaibah and others. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee&#8217; (no.319,1/p.386).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">97. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Abdur-Razzaaq. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee'(no.318).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">98. Narrated by &#8216;Abd ur-Razzaaq (no.9012) with sahih isnaad from Ibn &#8216;Umar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">99. I say: And Allaah knows better which of them Rasoolullah did &#8211; and it may be that he prayed twice with them &#8211; the first being Fard and the second nafl as he did in some of his battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">100. 101. 102. 100,101,102. All of this is established in the hadith of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; and as for what occurs in some Hajj books that he should face the Qiblah upon stoning Jamrat-ul-Aqabah, then that contradicts this authentic hadith &#8211; and whatever contradicts it is shaadh (Glossary), or rather munkar (Glossary) as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah'(no.4864).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">103. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;So if the sun sets and he is still in Minaa &#8211; then he must remain for the stoning on the third day&#8221;. I say: And the great majority of scholars agree on that &#8211; contrary to what Ibn Hazm says in &#8216;Al-Muhallaa&#8217; (7.185). And An-Nawaawi drives proof for them(the majority) from what is understood from Allaah ta&#8217;alas saying: faman ta&#8217;ajjala fee yaumaini falaa ithma &#8216;alaihi (8:283): &#8220;And the day (al-Yaum) is a name for the daytime not including the night&#8221;. And using what is confirmed from &#8216;Umar and his son &#8216;Abdullah who both said : &#8220;Whoever is at Minaa on the second day and the evening comes upon him &#8211; then let him stay until the next day and leave together with the people.&#8221; And the wording of &#8216;Al-Muwatta&#8217; from Ibn &#8216;Umar is: &#8220;Then let him not leave until he has stoned the Jamaraat on the next day.&#8221; And Imaam Muhamad in his Muwatta (p.233) narrates it from Imaam Maalik and says: &#8220;And that is what we accept, and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah and people in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">104. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1097). And I have pointed out there that my narrating it as being from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in the Original is a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">105. Reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah &#8211; and authenticated by a group of the scholars. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1080).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">106. Hadith hasan reported by Al-Bazzaar and Al-Baihaqi and others from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; Ibn Hajr declaring its isnaad to be hasan, and it has supporting narrations which I have quoted in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (No.2477).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">107. Reported with Mu&#8217;allaq isnaad by Bukharee (Mukhtasar al Bukharee, no.287) joined by a number of scolars whom I have named in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (no.803).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">108. Reported by Tabraani and Diyaa-al-Maqdisee in &#8216;Al-Mukhtara&#8217; and &#8216;Al-Mundhari&#8217; declares its isnaad to be hasan. And it is as he said as it has another chain of transmission as I have shown in &#8216;Tahdheer us-Saajid&#8230;&#8217; (pp.106-107 2nd edition).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">109. Reported by AHmad and others from the hadith of Jaabir from the Prophet with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars whom I have mentioned in &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1129).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">114. Reported by AHmad with a sahih isnaad to the standard of Bukharee and Muslim &#8211; who also both narrate a similar hadith &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1086). And they also narrate a witness to it from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1748).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">115.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">116. Reported by Baihaqi with a good sahih isnaad from Jaabir &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. And it has an authentic mursal narration as a witness to it reported by &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq in his &#8216;Musannaf'(no.9127). And Ibn Taimiyyah narrates that the salaf used to transport it.</span></p>

And this innovation was stopped many years ago-al-hamdulillah-however the one after it remains in its place and in Al-Baajoorees explanation of Ibn ul-Qaasim (1/41) there occurs: &#8220;And it is forbidden to go for a pleasure trip to see the carrying of the Ka&#8217;bahs covering and the coverings of the Station of Ibrahim,etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">121. And this and the one after it are some of the most wicked innovations because of what they contain regarding use of tricks to get around the shaaree&#8217;ah and the risk of falling into shameful actions as is obvious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">122. see 121.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">123. And it is authentically reported from &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; that he saw some people while on the way to Hajj going to a certain place, so he said: What is this? So it was said: A place where Rasoolullah prayed. So he said: In this way where the People of the Book destroyed. They took the places connected with there Prophets as a place of prayer. Whomsoever of you reaches such a place at the time of prayer then let him pray, otherwise he should not do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">124. This appears to refer to wiping the face and chest with the two hands resembling a cross.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">125. For the greeting for the Haraam Mosque is tawaaf, then the praying behind the Station of Ibrahim and has preceded from the Prophet, from his action. And see &#8216;Al-Qawaa&#8217;id an-Nooraneeyah&#8217; of Ibn Taimiyyah (pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">126. What has been authentically reported as a practice of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar is the same that has preceded (see point no.55).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">127. This du&#8217;aa besides being a novelty also contains that which contradicts the sunnah and that is using as a means of approach to Allaah the &#8216;right of the Mush&#8217;ar-ul-Haraam and the ka&#8217;bah &#8230;&#8217;but rather than one should use Allaahs names and attributes as a means of approach (wasilah) to Him. And the Hanafi scholars have declared that is hated to say: &#8220;Allaah I ask You by the right of the Mash&#8217;aral Haraam&#8230;etc&#8221; As occurs in &#8216;Haashiyat Ibn &#8216;Aa-bideen&#8217; and other books. see &#8216;at-Tawassul&#8217; Anwa&#8217;uhu wa ah-kaamuhu&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">128. And this is one of the worst innovations because of what it involves regarding twisting the shari&#8217;ah which is clearly shown in the Book and Sunnah merely on account of opinion. And the chief responsibility for the lack of total use of the meat lies upon the pilgrims themselves, because they do not when sacrificing take account of the directions of the Wise Legislator &#8211; as is shown in the Original (pg.87-88)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">129. And the Sunnah is to go to visit the mosqe as the Prophet said: do not journey accept to three mosques&#8230;so when he reaches it and prays upon entering then he may go to the grave. And it should be known that traveling to visit his grave &#8211; peace and blessings be upon him &#8211; and other graves is one thing, and visiting without traveling is something else &#8211; contrary to what has become widespread amongst the later people &#8211; among them holders of doctorates who have confused the two &#8211; and have further declared that Ibn Taimiyyah in particular and the salafis in general deny the authenticity of visiting the Prophets graves &#8211; and this is a clear untruth. See the matter fully explained in our refutation of Doctor Bootee who produced a succession of such sayings in the magazine &#8216;Islamic civilization&#8217;. Then I produced a particular treatise called &#8216;in defense of the Prophetic hadith&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">130. And al-Ghazali-may Allaah have mercy upon him-did well in speaking against this kissing (1/244) and said: &#8220;it is a habit of Christians and Jews&#8221; So is there anyone to take heed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">131. And what is correct is to say: &#8220;assalaamu&#8217;alaika yaa rasoolullaahi wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika yaa abaa bakr &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika ya &#8216;umar&#8221; as Ibn &#8216;Umar used to. And if he adds something slight as he feels at the time &#8211; not always doing it &#8211; then it is alright insha&#8217;Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">132. And this is in addition to its being an innovation and exaggeration in religion, and in contradiction to the Prophet&#8217;s saying: Do not take my grave as a festival, and send blessings upon me and it is a reason for many Sunnahs being lost and many benefits &#8211; and that it is the dhikr after the prayer recited after giving salaam &#8211; for they leave all of these and hurry to this innovation So may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: &#8220;No innovation is brought to life except that a Sunnah is killed off &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">133. And there is absolutely no benefit in these two as they were only put there for decoration and to charm the people &#8211; and they have lately been removed &#8211; alhamdulillaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">134. And the hadith about that id da&#8217;eef &#8211; and cannot be an evidence for it is as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8217; (no.364). So it is not permissible to act on it as it is Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; especially as it may cause trouble to some pilgrims as I myself once found &#8211; thinking that the hadith about it was authentic &#8211; and he might miss some prayers and thus be a hardship &#8211; which Allaah has delivered him from. And one honorable person holds this hadith to be strong &#8211; based upon the attestation of Ibn Hibbaan in favour of one of its unknown narrators &#8211; and the scholars of Hadith criticism do not accept this type of attestation. Among them the aforementioned honorable person as he himself has stated in his refutation of Shaikh al-Ghumaaree in the &#8216;Journal of the Salafi University&#8217; which comes from India. See the Book of Shaikh &#8216;Abd-ul-Rabee&#8217;aan in reply to him, as he has written well and is of benefit and explains the mistakes regarding supporting this hadith and the contradictions involved.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Fataawaa al-Jaliyyah ‘anil-Manaahij Ad-Da’wiyyah (pg. 51-55)<br />
Compiled by Hasan Ibn Mahmood Ibn Mansoor ad-Daghreeri.<br />
Taken from Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> &#8220;Noble Shaikh Ahmad Ibn Yahyaa An-Najmee, may Allaah give you tawfeeq, there are found some books that include talk about these hizbee groups, which have incorporated a methodology that opposes the methodology of the Salaf in the fields of knowledge and action. And these books fall in between that which is large and difficult for the beginner to grasp of its content and between that which is short and contains little benefit. So O Shaikh, we hope that you can give us a clear but brief image of the most prominent of some of these methodologies’ founders and some of the issues they are criticized in. This is so that the Muslims can beware of falling into any part of that. And if you would be so kind O Shaikh as to direct the last of your talk to focusing on the true methodology, which every Muslim is obligated to follow&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> All praise be to Allaah, and may His peace and blessings be upon the most honorable of all creation, our prophet Muhammad, and on his family and Companions. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa&#8217;at-ul-Ikhwaan al-Muslimoon</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Definition of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the followers of Hasan Al-Bannaa. There are several points to be noted about their methodology, the most important of which are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They show a lack of importance to Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah [1], which is the most important matter in Islaam, since the Islaam of an individual is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They remain silent and concede to the people in their performance of major Shirk, supplication to other than Allaah, performance of tawaaf around graves, making oaths to the dead in the graves, sacrificing in their names and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this methodology was a Sufi. He had a connection with Sufism to the point that he gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Al-Khusaafee upon (following) his Khusaafee Shadh-lee order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The presence of innovations amongst them and their worshipping Allaah through them &#8211; even to the point that the founder of this methodology acknowledged that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would attend their gatherings of dhikr and that he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would forgive what past sins they had committed, as is found in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;May Allaah bless the one who upon light in which he appeared<br />
To the worlds, and so he surpassed the sun and the moon<br />
This habeeb (i.e. Muhammad) along with his beloved has gathered<br />
And pardoned everyone in what sins they did in the past.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They call to establishing the Khilaafah and this is an innovation because the Messengers and their followers were not entrusted with anything except to call to Tawheed. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger, (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah and avoid the taaghoot (false deities).’&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They have a lack of Walaa and Baraa (loyalty and disavowment) or a weak form of it. This is made clear in their call to bring closeness between the Sunnis and the Shee’ah. And their founder was quoted as saying: &#8220;We will cooperate with one another in what we agree on and pardon one another in what we disagree on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. They hate and despise the people of Tawheed and those who adhere to the Salafee Way. This is made clear in their talk concerning the Saudi state, which is founded upon Tawheed and which teaches Tawheed in its schools, institutes and universities. And it was made clear in their killing of Jameel Ar-Rahmaan Al-Afghaanee just because he called to Tawheed and because he had schools in which he would teach Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. They pursue the mistakes of the leaders and expose their faults &#8211; whether true or false &#8211; spreading them amongst the youth in order to make the leaders appear hateful to them and so that they can fill their hearts with contempt against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. They hold detestable partisanship to the party they ascribe themselves to. So they show friendship based on this party and they show enmity based on this party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They give their oath of allegiance to work for the Ikhwaani Manhaj according to the ten conditions that the founder has set forth. And there are other issues of concern, which perhaps can be dealt with at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Qutubees</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that have read the books of Sayyid Qutb and accepted what is in them from truth and falsehood. So you will find them defending Sayyid Qutb when someone criticizes him, even if the truth is with the one criticizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known that Sayyid Qutb was not from the men of religious knowledge. His original status was that he was an author. Then he adopted the beliefs of the Ash&#8217;arees &#8211; the belief of ta&#8217;weel (misinterpretation of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes), as did others among the learned people from Egypt. He has serious and vile errors, which the people of knowledge have refuted and exposed. But when they expose these errors, this results in the rage of the Qutubees befalling them by way of their criticizing, speaking ill and discrediting them. So Allaah is sufficient for us and He is the Best of Guardians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the basic principle is that: Men are known by way of the Haqq (truth) and the Haqq is not known by way of men. So it is obligatory on us to accept the truth and to worship Allaah, Lord of all worlds, by it, and to abandon everyone that treads an innovated methodology. And we must place as our role model, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), his Khulafaa, his Companions, and those who followed them amongst the Imaams of guidance. And Allaah is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Suroorees</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims &#8211; all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers. Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa&#8217;at-ut-Tableegh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that follow Muhammad Ilyaas, the founder of this Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A biography of the founder: Muhammad Ilyaas was born in 1302H. He memorized the Qur’aan and read the Six Collections of Hadeeth. [2] He was upon the Deobandi methodology, taking the Hanafee madh-hab, the Ash’aree and Matureedee Creed and the Sufi way. They have four Sufi orders amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Naqshabandees<br />
2. The Sahroordees<br />
3. The Qaadirees, and<br />
4. The Jishtees</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyaas gave the Sufi bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to Shaikh Rasheed Al-Kankoohee, who later became Shaikh Rasheed As-Saharanpuree. Then he renewed it with Shaikh Ahmad As-Saharanpuree who certified him to take oaths of allegiance. Muhammad Ilyaas would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee, in what is known as the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation). And he would go out to the grave of ‘Abdul-Qudoos Al-Kankoohee, the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood [3] on him. He resided and taught in Delhi and passed away in 1363H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Circumstances that brought about the start of the movement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Abul-Hasan An-Nadwee saw that Muhammad Ilyaas took refuge in this way of giving Da’wah when the ways of blind-following failed to rectify the people of his region. Shaikh Miyaan Muhammad Aslam quotes one of Ilyaas’ sayings that he received kashf (mystic disclosure) to follow this way through a dream in which he was inspired with a new tafseer (interpretation) of Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8220;You were the best nation brought out for mankind, commanding good and forbidding evil and believing in Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] And it was that going out (khurooj) to call people to the way of Allaah cannot be realized by staying in one place based on Allaah’s word <b>&#8220;brought out&#8221;</b> and that one’s Eemaan increases by going out in this khurooj based on Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8220;and believing in Allaah&#8221;</b> after having said: <b>&#8220;brought out for mankind.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following can be noted from what has just been mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Qur’aan is not interpreted by makshoofaat (mystical disclosures), and by Sufi dreams, of which the majority of them, rather all of them come from the inspirations of the Devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is apparent from what was stated previously that the founder of this Jamaa’ah was engrossed in Sufism from head to toe. This is because he gave two oaths of allegiance on it and was tested by its false beliefs and because he would spend his time sitting by the graves of Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a qubooree (grave worshipper) and a khuraafee. This is clear from his saying: &#8220;&#8230;and he would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee.&#8221; And concerning the second person, he mentioned that he forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him. So his being attached to the grave of the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him is without doubt a clear proof that he held that same belief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Those who believe in wahdat-ul-wujood claim that Allaah embodies Himself inside the attractive woman &#8211; and refuge is sought from Allaah! This is a matter that has reached the highest level of repulsiveness. May Allaah give them what they deserve of His curses and wrath!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The methodology of the Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh can be summarized in six issues or six principles or six characteristics:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Actualizing the statement of Tawheed: <i>&#8220;Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah&#8221;</i> (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and Muhammad is His Messenger)<br />
2. Praying with full submissiveness and humility<br />
3. Knowledge of the Virtues (<i>Fadaa’il</i>) and not the Fiqh issues (<i>Masaa’il</i>) along with knowledge of dhikr<br />
4. Showing generosity to the Muslim<br />
5. Correcting the intention<br />
6. Calling to Allaah (i.e. Da’wah) and going out (i.e. khurooj) for that purpose in the Way of Allaah upon the tablighi manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an objective behind each of these six principles or characteristics as well as a virtue to be attained. So for example the objective behind (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>) is to: &#8220;Eradicate the corrupted yaqeen (Certainty) from the heart while placing the correct and valid yaqeen into the Essence (dhaat) of Allaah.&#8221; They really intend the belief of wahdat-ul-wujood with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point to be noted about Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was raised upon Sufism and gave two oaths of allegiance on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He would position himself by graves, waiting to receive Kashf (Sufi mystical disclosure) and meditative ideas from the deceased inside them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He would perform the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation) at the gravesite of ‘Abdul-Quddoos Al-Kankoohee, who used to believe in wahadat-ul-wujood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Jishtee Muraaqabah is to sit by a grave for half an hour of every week, covering the face and reciting this dhikr: &#8220;Allaahu Haadiree, Allaahu Naadhiree.&#8221; [4] This statement or this action if done sincerely for Allaah is an innovation. And if it is done for the person in the grave then it is committing Shirk with Allaah. And the last of the two is what is most evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They have four of their graves located in the masjid from where their Da’wah emerged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The founder of this Jamaa’ah believed in Kashf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a grave worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The Tablighis perform their worship with an innovated form of dhikr, done in the way of the Sufis. This is by splitting up the statement of Tawhheed (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Whoever cuts off the negation part of the Statement of Tawheed from its affirmation part intentionally, by saying &#8220;Laa Ilaaha&#8221; (only), then this necessitates the fact that he has committed disbelief. Shaikh Hamood At-Tuwayjiree stated this, quoting it from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They make it permissible to wear amulets that have on them mystical writings and names of unknown people, which probably are names of devils! And this is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p>[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This is the category of Tawheed related to the Oneness of Allaah in the worship that is performed to Him, i.e. that we worship only Allaah and no one else.</p>
<p>[2] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> The hadeeth Collections of Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhee, Ibn Maajah and Ahmad.</p>
<p>[3] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> Wahdatul-Wujood is the belief that Creator (Allaah) and the Creation is one existence.</p>
<p>[4] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This has something with the meaning of &#8220;Allaah is my ever-Present Accompanier, Allaah is my Watcher&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Al-Ajwibat-ul-Mufeedah &#8216;an As&#8217;ilat-il-Manaahij-il-Jadeedah</i> (pg. 33-37) [2nd Edition]<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone might say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Why do you talk about the <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/">Mu’atazliah</a></em>, the <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/">Jahmiyyah</a></em>, the <em>Zanaadiqah</em>, the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/ashariyyah/">Ash<em>’</em>arees</a>, the <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/">Khawaarij</a> </em>and the <em>Murji’ah</em> and always mention them when speaking about the issues of Creed, when these groups have ceased to exist and its adherents have died out?” As the saying goes: “They have been consumed by time.” So there is no reason to mention them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our response is, and with Allaah lies the success: Yes, these sects existed in the past, and their followers and founders have died out ages ago. However, their ideologies still prevail, and their beliefs have not come to an end. Rather, the followers of these ideas and beliefs, who have been influenced by these groups, are still present among us today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their ideologies and beliefs are passed on from generation to generation, and they have people who continue to pass them on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the beliefs of the <em>Mu’tazliah</em>, then it is still in existence today and in fact it is widely spread amongst those who ascribe to Islaam. This is since the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/shia-raafidah/"><em>Shee’ah</em></a>, in all of their various sects and denominations, even the Zaydees among them, adhere to the beliefs of the Mu’tazliah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ash’arees, then it is a sect that exists in groups amongst a majority of the Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the belief of <i>Irjaa,</i> it can be found also in the Hanafees who believe that Eemaan (Faith) is just tasdeeq (affirmation) and <i>qawl</i> (speech). So actions, according to them, do not fall into the fold of Eemaan. Even though this <i>Irjaa</i> is of a lesser nature, it is still from the <i>Irjaa</i> of the well-known people of rhetoric.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the apostates, such as those who believe in <i>wahdat-ul-wujood</i> and other than them, then they exist today as well, since the followers of Ibn ‘Arabee can be found today and they are from the extreme <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/">Sufis</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, when we mention these groups, we are not talking about the actual groups of old, but rather we are talking about the groups that exist among the Muslims today. And this is something that is not hidden from the students of knowledge. So it is only those who are unaware of the realities or those who wish to confuse the people and spread false beliefs that condemn us when we mention these groups. So it is upon such people to ask before they condemn. This is just a short discussion on the matter, but in reality this topic is vast, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will present some examples below that make it clear that the ideologies of these destructive groups are still present today:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Sayyid Qutb said in his book “In the Shade of the Qur’aan” (4/2328): “The Qur’aan is present and in existence just like the earth and the heavens.” This is the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/quran/">belief that the Qur’aan is created</a>, and this is the view of the Jahmiyyah and other deviant groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He also said in the afore-mentioned book (6/4002) while interpreting Allaah’s statement: <b>“Say: He is Allaah, the One”</b> [Surah Al-Ikhlaas: 1]: “This indeed refers to the oneness of existence. So there is no reality except for His reality, nor is there a true existence except for His existence. So everything else that exists, its existence stems from that actual existence.” This is the belief of <i><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/10/18/the-ascendancy-of-allaah-a-refutation-of-wahdatul-wujood-hulool-shaykh-albaanee/">wahdat-ul-wujood</a></i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Muhammad Qutb said: “The matter requires us to call the people to Islaam all over again, not because, this time, they reject saying <i><b>‘Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah’ </b></i>with their mouths, as the people during the first stage of strangeness would do, but because the people during this time reject the main requisite of <i><b>Laa Ilaaha Ilaa Allaah</b></i>, which is: Judging by the Legislation of Allaah.” [Quoted from the book “Our Current Situation” (pg. 29)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: This is declaring the masses to be disbelievers, in the absolute sense. If this is not so, then how can he judge that the people reject Allaah’s Rule. And how can he liken them to the Days of Ignorance prior to Islaam, without going into detail or making exceptions for those who do in fact implement Allaah’s Legislation, and who have no constitution except the Book of Allaah? These kinds of general statements are oft repeated by these writers, as if they don’t acknowledge the existence of the huge Salafee Islamic state located in the heart of Arabia. And it is as if they don’t acknowledge the existence of Muslims in various other regions that are from the followers of Hadeeth, supporters of the Sunnah and adherents to the beliefs of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strange thing is that these people, or some of them, were living in this Islamic state (The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) at the time they made such statements, which contain grave deception for the readers, such that an average person is led to believe that there cannot be found an Islamic state today that professes <i>Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah</i>, implementing its requisites and ruling by Allaah’s Laws. And it leads the reader to believe that there cannot be found any individuals or groups that adhere to Tawheed on the face of this earth. And this is deceiving, misleading and deluding the readers. So let the student of knowledge take note of this phenomenon that is widespread amongst these types of writers, may Allaah guide them to what is correct!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. One of those who ascribes himself to the Da’wah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“From the outward display of sins is when a person boasts about his sins in front of his colleagues. So he begins to speak aloud, saying he did such and such, and he goes into detail about many of his sins. This kind of person will not be forgiven (!!), unless he repents, because the Prophet ruled concerning him that he will not be pardoned: <b>‘Everyone from my ummah will be pardoned except for those who outwardly profess their evil.’</b> And what is worse and viler than this is when some of them say: ‘I have unlawful relations’ or ‘I have girlfriends’ or ‘I go on dates.’ This person is filled with sins. Some of these people even record sins on tapes! There is no honor for these people since they are apostates by doing this!! They record how to beguile a girl and get her to commit lewd acts. <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">This is apostasy from Islaam!</span> This person (who records this) will be in the Fire of Hell forever unless he repents!!”</b> [From the tape “A Gathering on the Platform]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with regard to some of the singers, whose tapes are spread around by the youth – tapes which call to filthiness and which delude the young boys and girls, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“I am certain that the person who does this act, the least that can be said about him, is that he takes sins lightly. And there is no doubt that belittling a sin, especially if it is a major sin and the scholars have unanimously agreed on its prohibition, constitutes disbelief in Allaah. So the likes of these people, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no doubt that their actions are apostasy from Islaam</span>. I say this with a tranquil and calm heart.”</span> <b>[The tape: “The Youth – Questions and Problems]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I say:</strong> Declaring sinners to be disbelievers and interpreting the spread and distribution of sins amongst the people as being a belittlement of sins that leads to disbelief, this shows hastiness in labeling people disbelievers due to major sins and a lack of showing restraint</span>. And this is from the methodology of the Khawaarij, as they declare people to be disbelievers due to major sins. As for the example he gave of a person manifesting his sins and evil relationships with sinners, then this kind of talk shows that these things are probable but do not consist of clear proof. Perhaps the thing that causes the person to do this is ignorance. This is why we must remind them and not declare them disbelievers. And this is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Furthermore, belittling something and taking it lightly does not constitute a mockery of it. In fact, everyone that commits a sin, whether major or minor, doesn’t do so unless he first considers it trivial and belittles it. So someone who takes something lightly doesn’t necessarily ridicule it. And who is the one that is free from sins?! And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another person said, whilst asking a question and then responding to it at the same time: <span style="color:#999999;">“Do you think that the evils that are present in our communities today are just sinful matters? Many people assume today that interest is just a sin or a major sin, and that drugs and alcohol are sins, and that bribery is just a sin or one of the major sins… No doubt O brothers!! I have looked into this matter and it has become clear to me now that: Many people in our societies have made interest lawful, and refuge is sought in Allaah. Did you know that now the interest-based banks in our country has reached two million customers? I swear this to you by Allaah! Does each individual from these millions know that interest is Haraam, but yet still deals with it even though it is a sin?! By Allaah!! So then, from the danger that is present today, due to the vast amount of widespread sins is that many people have made these major sins permissible and lawful, and we seek Allaah’s refuge!</span> <b>[From the tape Tawheed First (!!)]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reply with the same answer I gave in the previous example. However, this example is more dangerous for the one who made this statement, in my understanding, since in his grave exaggeration, he claims that what occurs in this society from interest, alcohol and bribery, all of these are not just disobedience or major sins. And he swears by Allaah to this! Being determined that the one who commits sins is deeming it to be permissible, without hearing from anyone of them that they clearly assert interest to be lawful, or dealing with bribes to be lawful or using drugs and alcohol to be lawful – to positively deem these people to be disbelievers without hearing these statements come from them or having a reliable proof that bears witness that they in fact deem these acts to be permissible, and to instead only have assumptions, is a clear proof of the weak restraint and lack of consideration this individual has. This is the methodology of the Khawaarij and the Mu’tazliah. So my advice to him and those like him is to recant from making such general assertions that are more dangerous for them than for others. Turning back to the truth is better than persisting in falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. A third person, who has a doctorate in ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, said whilst holding in his hand a flyer from a hotel in one of the Gulf states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“In this hotel, it clearly states, that they serve alcoholic drinks, in addition to the other things it has…So this is a clear call to alcohol and to naked and intermingled dancing whilst drinking alcohol. We seek Allaah’s refuge from this disbelief.”</span> <b>[From Cassette No. 272/2 of The Explanation of al-‘Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah] </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said in a book of his:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Disbelief and apostasy has appeared in our newspapers, evil has spread in our circles and we are called to fornication on our radios and television sets. And we have made interest lawful.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was prepared and printed with various different titles. In Pakistan, it went by the title: “Removing the Grief from the Scholars of the Ummah.” In America, it goes by the title: “Kissinger’s Promise.” And in Egypt, the book was titled: “Facts surrounding the Gulf Crisis.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, you have seen how this individual has taken it upon himself to make the statement that we have made interest permissible. But we, all praise be to Allaah, do not deem interest as being permissible, nor does our society. Nor do we consider simply distributing alcoholic drinks to some of the neighboring regions as being open disbelief that expels one from the fold of Islaam. Rather, that which we worship Allaah with, is that those things mentioned by these individuals that ascribe themselves to the Da’wah – all of these things are sins, apart from disbelief. In fact all of these acts are a lesser form of disbelief (i.e. minor disbelief), meaning that they are acts of disobedience and major sins that negate the completeness of Eemaan of the person who commits them, but not the foundation of Eemaan, as the Prophet said: <b>“A fornicator does not fornicate whilst being a believer at the time he fornicates. And a thief does not steal whilst being a believer at the time he is stealing…” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt the Eemaan (Faith) that is being negated here is the completeness of Eemaan (i.e. so the sinner does not have complete Eemaan, meaning his Eemaan is deficient). And there are many more examples of this in our Religion. We ask Allaah to grant us understanding of our Religion and to guide these people and their likes to the truth. My dear brother, O you who strives for this Salafee methodology! After seeing these examples of the ideologies present in some of the callers today, not to mention the youth that are deceived by them, and who sit in front of them, taking their ideas and beliefs, which destroy the Creed of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeing all this, will you still say: “Why do you talk about these groups that have come to an end”, when their deviant and corrupt beliefs and methods still exist and their misguidance is still present?? So reflect, may Allaah guide you, on the importance of Tawheed and of implementing it, and on warning about all of the deviant groups in every time and place, and on returning back to the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih (righteous predecessors), in light of the Book and the Sunnah, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">O Virtuous Shaykh, with what do you advise us during this time (in) which trials (fitan) have increased and the people of innovation have become widespread and the death of the scholars? (are increasing)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you with the first thing (which is) to have<strong> taqwa of Allaah</strong> and <strong>increase in your supplication to Allaah</strong> that He keeps us and you firm upon the religion and that He protects us and you from the evils of trials (fitan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I advise you with <strong>seeking knowledge from the people of knowledge</strong> and the diligence in seeking knowledge, because one will not fall into trial (fitna) with Allaah’s permission (only) if he has the correct knowledge. But if you don’t have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don’t know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and <strong>do not become lazy</strong> upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: The Al-Tijaniyyah sect has their own supplication called Salat Al-Fatih, which they consider to be better than reciting the Qur&#8217;an. Is this true? Moreover, on Friday before Maghrib (Sunset) Salah and after Subh (Dawn) Salah, they circle around a piece of cloth on which, they claim, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Ahmad Al-Tijany sit. During such times they recite the supplication called Salat Al-Fatih. Please, provide evidence and clarify if this practice is proper.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>All their claims are false. Moreover, their deeds are null and void and are considered to be Bid&#8217;ahs (rejected innovation in religion).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For more clarification, I will cite the so-called Salat-ul-Fatih (Remembrance from the Tijaniyyah order).The following is cited in the Simplified Encyclopedia of Contemporary Religions, Doctrines, and Parties &#8211; The World Assembly Of Muslim Youths:<span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;Their leader, Ahmad Al-Tijany, claims that he physically met the Prophet, peace be upon him, talked with him, and learned Salat-ul-Fatih from him- The wording of this Salat reads: &#8220;O Lord, have peace and blessings upon our master Muhammad, the opener of the closed, the last of the prophets, the supporter of right with right, and the guide to Your straight path, his family as high as his standing and rank.&#8221; They have beliefs concerning this Salah, including:The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, told him that the reward for reciting it once is equivalent to that of reciting the Qur&#8217;an six times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, told him once again that the reward for reciting this Salah once is six thousand times as much as that for every Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), Du`a&#8217; (supplication), long or short, and the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an (Jawahir Al-Ma`any Wa Bulugh Al-Amany, vol. 1, p. 136)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The reward for such Salah is gained only if the reciter is authorized to recite it. This means there should be a chain of authorization tracing back to Ahmad Al-Tijany who, according to him, received this Salah from the Messenger of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allegedly being the words of Allah (Exalted be He), this Salah is deemed to be a Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) (Al-Durrah Al-Faridah, vol. 4, p. 128).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8211; He who recites Salat-ul-Fatih ten times will gain a reward that even an `Arif (Sufi who has reached a high station of worship) who had lived for one million years would not get if he had not recited it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8211; He who recites this Salah even once will have his sins forgiven and will have a reward as much as that for six thousand Tasbihs (saying: &#8220;Subhan Allah [Glory be to Allah]&#8221;), Du`a&#8217;s (supplication), and Dhikrs. (See Mushtaha Al-Kharif Al-Jani, pp. 127, 299 and 300.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that the following verse applies to the above: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, &#8216;This is from Allah,&#8217; to purchase with it a little price!&#8221; </span>The Committee elaborated on this sect in the previous Fatwas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A beautiful and comprehensive explanation delivered by <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ramzaan al-Haajiree</em> (May <strong>Allah</strong> Preserve Him) expounding on the guidance of the Companions in dealing with the people of innovation. Herein the <em>Shaykh</em> presents some lofty benefits and salient points of contemplation from the <em>hadith</em> of <em>Ibn Mas’ood</em> and the people in <em>dhikr</em> circles, thus clarifying the approach of <em>Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em> regarding the people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise was translated and compiled by <em>Abu Afnaan Muhammad ‘Abdullah</em> (May <strong>Allah</strong> Preserve him) with the explicit permission and approval of <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ramzaan al-Haajiree.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An excerpt taken from the chapter:</strong> <em>The Person of Innovation in The Religion is Not Granted The Success To Repent</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Can a person of <i>bid’ah</i> come back? (The answer is) he sees himself as being upon the truth and the correct position, and believes that he is getting closer to Allah by practicing these forms of <i>bid’ah</i>. For this reason, the person of <i>bid’ah</i> is not granted success to make repentance.Why is this? This is because he does not consider himself as being wrong in the first place, unlike the person who engages in sins. Because the latter, even while he is engaging in sins or acts of disobedience, he knows within himself that he is doing something wrong, he wants to make repentance. However, the person who is upon <i>bid’ah </i>believes that he is doing a righteous action (bringing him closer to Allah), so how can he make repentance?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout history, the ways of the people of innovation has been apparent to the scholars of <em>Ahl Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah</em>; however, in our time, the ability to distinguish  <em>haqq</em> (truth) from <em>baatil</em> (falsehood) has become unclear to most muslims, especially since many of the innovators and deviant groups use clever ways to penetrate the hearts and minds of the people of the Sunnah, like labeling themselves with praiseworthy descriptions such as <em>salaf</em>i, <em>athari</em> and <em>ahl-hadeeth</em> etc., when they are the furthest from the methodology of the <em>salaf-us-saalih (righteous predecessors)</em>. <em>Alhamdulillah</em> we have the people of knowledge, who have not been deceived by these tactics but have the insight into the tell tale signs of the people of innovation. With the aid of our scholars, who equip us with the necessary tools to recognize these people, we can steer clear of their misguidance and be on guard against their infiltration amongst our ranks. The noble <em>Shaykh Khalid ibn Dhawi adh-Dhufayree</em> (May Allaah preserve him) elaborated on several of their characteristics and exposed some of their deceptive ways. The <em>Shaykh</em> detailed some of the major signs of the people of innovation, as their signs are plenty, with a focus on the more apparent groups and personalities from amongst the people of innovation, like the <em>khawarij</em> and their spokesmen in our recent times <em>&#8216;Abdullaah Azaam</em> and <em>Sayid Qutb</em>. May<strong>Allaah, Al-Haqq </strong>show us the truth and make it easy for us to follow it and show us the falsehood and make it easy for us to distance ourselves from it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A question posed to <em>Ash-Shaykh</em> <em>al-Allaamah Muhammad ibn &#8216;AbdulWahhab </em><em>al-Wasaabee (hafidhahullaah)</em>concerning the distinguishing characteristics and traits of <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Ahl Tamyee&#8217;</em> (people who are laxadasical about the<em>deen</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>[Q]: </strong>What are the distinguishing characteristics and traits of <em>Ahl Tamyee&#8217;</em> (people who are laxadasical about the <em>deen</em>)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[A]:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">From their characteristics is that they do not hold on tenaciously to the <em>Qur&#8217;aan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are not people who have adherence and care for the Book of<strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>, and they do not have a particular focus of the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah.</em> </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They do not return to the major scholars of <em>Islaam</em>. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will find that if one of them is advised, he will not accept the advice, and he will not return to the truth rather he will become stubborn and will remain upon the issues he was advised against. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He will follow his desires and whims, and you will also see that they are not people that are particularily successful in their statements and actions rather the lack of success is seen from them and the lack of guidance. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will see the effects of sins upon them and the effects of transgression are seen upon them. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are also close to other people of <em>tamy&#8217;ee</em> (negligent in the deen), and the people of <em>hizbiyyah</em> (partiisianship and sectarianism), and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">they are close sometimes to the disbelievers. They become close to them and they veer away from the scholars, becasue being close to the scholars is a fear for them. They fear that the scholars will tie them down to the evidences, and the scholars will have them adhere to the rulings of the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>sunnah</em>, so they are not keen in being in touch with the scholars, but rather they are happy to be alone in their own places and their own domains so that no one can link them and tie them down to the evidences from the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>sunnah</em> and they are actually pleased with this, with being loners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are from their signs and their signs are many, and we ask <strong>Allaah</strong> for success</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> commenced his lecture by stating, the fact that the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) </em>frequently warned against <em>bid’ah</em> (innovation in the religion) in all of his sermons is indicative of the extreme danger of innovation, which is from the reasons of annihilation and destruction. The Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> was keen on ensuring the guidance of his <em>ummah</em> and from the care he had for his nation is that he never left a single door that leads to goodness except that he encouraged going to it and never left a door of evil except that he warned us form going towards it. <span style="color:#993300;">From the greatest of those evils that have become widespread in this ummah and have caused great confusion to many people are <em>bid’ah</em> (innovation in the religion) and <em>ahwaa</em> (desires)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> gave us foundational principles on how to deal with the people of innovation, desires, differing and sects with their various waves. Whether they are from the ancient sects that endured like the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, <em>Mu’tazilah</em>, <em>Ash`aris</em> and other than them; or likewise, the modern day groups like the <em>Ikhwaanis</em>, <em>Tableeghis</em>, <em>Takfirees</em> and <em>Qutbis</em>; all of them are innovated sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh adh-Dhufayree (hafidhahullaah)</em> then went on to mention some ahadeeth where the Prophet<em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> warned against <em>bid’ah</em>; and he has shown us the way to escape and survive innovations, which is to beware of them, warn against them, avoid them and their people and to refrain from mingling with the people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So boycotting <em>ahlul bid’ah</em> is from the greatest foundations in the religion that will continue to preserve the deen of a Muslim and protect him from the evil of the people of innovation and misguidance. This principle has been clarified in the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong>, and the <em>Salaf</em> were keen on establishing it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> then proceeded to narrate a wealth of <em>athaar</em> (narrations) from the <em>Salaf</em> concerning intermingling with <em>ahlul bid’ah wal ahwaa</em>. He said that the people of <em>bid’ah</em> actually scheme and plot against <em>Ahlus Sunnah</em>, so they enter into our ranks with the intention of misguiding us and begin by talking about the <em>Sunnah</em> then gradually introduce their innovation. So it behoves a man of the <em>Sunnah</em>, a <em>Salafi</em> to be intelligent and insightful in recognizing these approaches by the people of innovation and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued by stating that there is consensus of the <em>Salaf</em>, in all ages of the <em>ummah</em>, about boycotting and warning against ahlul <em>bid’ah</em><em>wal ahwaa</em> due to the eminent danger in mingling with them. Furthermore, <em>Shaykh adh-Dhufayree (hafidhahullaah)</em> clarified that our <em>Salaf</em> did not only warn against innovations but the innovators as well because surely innovations do not spread on their own; they need marketers. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So if the innovators are warned against, boycotted and refuted, the innovations that they carry will surely weaken and die</strong></span>.<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> However, in our times a people have emerged with a misguided and false principle, which maintains that you can warn against the innovation but not the innovator which is in total opposition to the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and the consensus of the Salaf.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> went on to quote the statements <em>Ahlul ‘Ilm</em> concerning sitting with and keeping the company of the people of innovation and earnestly advised us to flee from them. He continued that one should fear misguidance for himself, so it is obligatory to be as distant from the people of innovation as possible and we must beware of them, warn against them and not praise them. And from the greatest ways of remaining firm is to turn to <strong>Allaah</strong>, asking Him for steadfastness upon the deen and to leave off intermingling with <em>ahlul bid’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In clarifying this pertinent issue of the perils of intermingling with the people of innovation, <em>Shaykh Khalid adh-Dhufayree (hafidhahullaah)</em> went into much detail by abundantly quoting our <em>Salaf</em> regarding this topic. A must listen for the seeker of Truth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Introducing the topic, <em>Shaykh ‘Abdullaah (hafidhahullaah)</em> explained that linguistically, a <em>hawdh</em> is a place where water gathers and it is the place from which the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> will allow his nation to drink on <em>Yawmul Qiyaamah</em> (The Day of Resurrection). There is ijmaa’ (consensus) amongst <em>ahlul haqq</em> (the people of the truth) regarding the <em>hawdh</em> and according to <em>Al-Haafidh As-Suyooti (rahimahullaah)</em>, the mention of the <em>hawdh</em> has come from over fifty companions, including the four rightly guided caliphs, the prolific narrators of <em>ahadeeth</em> from the companions and other than them. He went on to say that despite the wealth of ahadeeth affirming the hawdh, there are those who deny its existence and thus it is befitting that they be prevented from drinking from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, the <em>Shaykh</em> provided us with an abundance of narrations from various books of hadeeth about the<em>hawdh</em>, its description and the events that will take place at it in addition to the statements of the scholars of the past concerning it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">From its description:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#008000;">It is massive</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">It is a noble place to drink from</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">The one who drinks from it will never be thirsty again</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">It is supplied directly from the river Kawthar in Jannah</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">It is whiter than milk, sweeter than honey, cooler than snow and more pleasant to smell than misk</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Its chalices are more numerous than the stars in the sky</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Its length and width is equal</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Every time you drink from it, it will only increase what is in it</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">In it are growing trunks of gold, musk and pearls which will bear fruit of all types of jewels</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh ‘Abdullaah al-Hadaad (hafidhahullaah)</em> further discussed the positions of <em>Ahlul ‘Ilm</em> (The People of Knowledge) on the order in which events will occur regarding the <em>hawdh</em>, the <em>siraat</em> and the <em>mizaan</em>. He then proceeded to narrate numerous <em>ahadeeth</em> about those who will be prevented from drinking from the <em>hawdh</em> of our beloved Prophet <em>Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> on the day of the greatest thirst.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those who will be prevented from drinking from the <em>hawdh</em> include:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Those who lie upon <strong>Allaah</strong> and His Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Those who innovate in the <em>deen</em> from the <em>rawaafidh</em>, <em>khawaarij</em> and the rest of <em>ahlul bid’ah wal ahwaa </em>(the people of innovation and desires)<em><br />
</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Those who are extreme in <em>dhulm </em>(oppression)</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Those who blot out the truth</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Those who are lackadaisical in the amount of sin and transgression they commit</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">Those who sinned publicly</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It was authentically reported that the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>“Certain people will be driven away from my Hawdh (the Prophet&#8217;s Basin in the Hereafter) on the Day of Judgment and I will say: &#8220;O my Lord, my Ummah my Ummah (another version reads: and I will say: My Companions, my Companions). It will be said (to me): &#8220;You do not know what they did after you (died). <strong>They continued deviating from the right path since you left them</strong>.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Related by Al-Bukhaari, Book on Prophets, Chpater on Allaah’s Saying: “And Allaah did take Ibraheem as a Khaleel”, no. 3349]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is merely a brief summary of the immense benefits contained in this highly informative lecture. All are encouraged to listen to it in order to become acquainted with the belief of <em>Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em>concerning this significant affair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to make us from those who drink from the hawdh of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and we seek refuge in Him from being prevented from doing so on that severe day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The People of Innovation are of Two Types</span><a href="http://ittibaa.com/5/post/2013/01/the-people-of-innovation-are-of-two-types.html" rel="nofollow"><br />
</a>Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee</strong> (hafidhahullaah)</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Shaykh <span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>aali<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> ibn Sa`d as-Su<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>aymee <em>hafi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">z</span>ahullaah </em>in  his taped explanation of <strong>Sharhus-Sunnah</strong> with regard to the point that the people who depart from the Truth are one of two people, said,“Yes, this is a precise categorisation from the Shaykh, <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>imahullaah</em>.  The innovators are indeed of two categories, because the Shaykh, as you know, throughout his whole book, his focus is upon the innovators.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>And from them there is a <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>category who actually want the Truth, but he does not attain it</strong></span>.  Just like the people of <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span></em><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em><em>ikr</em><em> </em>who we mentioned a short while ago (the same incident of those people in the masjid who were doing an innovated form of <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span></em><em>ikr </em>which `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood criticised)<em>.  </em>Those who said to Ibn Mas`ood,<em> ra</em><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span></em><em>i</em><em>y</em><em>Allaahu’an</em><em>h</em>, ‘We only intend the Truth.’ However, how many people there are who intend the Truth, but do not attain it.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Whoever intends the Truth, he should seek it from its correct place.  And the Truth does not come about through venerating individuals, nor through flashy words, nor by having a majority.  It only comes about through <em>ittibaa</em><em>`</em>, following the Truth, following the first generations, the generations of the Companions and the <em>Taabi`een</em> and proceeding upon their methodology.  So the like of this person (the first person, he strays into innovation but he only intends the Truth) is destroyed if he does not come back and seek the Truth with its proof from the correct place.</p>
<p>However his danger is less than the danger of the second category of the people.  And perhaps his harm will be restricted to himself, meaning the one who intends the Truth but he seeks it not in the correct way.  So he slips and innovates and falls into innovation, and the judgement upon him will be in the light of how severe his innovations are.   It may be of the level of something less or it may be something major or it may be something which takes him out of Islaam, but his danger will be less.</p>
<p>And your advising him should be between you and him, if you know that he is not a caller to innovation and that he does not propagate innovation.  Then you should come to him privately and you make clear to him the correct path, so that he can follow it.  You make clear to him the methodology of the <em>Ahlus</em><em>&#8211;</em><em>Sunnah wal</em><em>&#8211;</em><em>Jamaa</em><em>`</em><em>ah</em>.  You don’t make his affair open.  You don’t mention him upon the <em>mi</em><em>n</em><em>bar</em>s.  You don’t mention him as being a person with criticism.  Rather you direct him and give him sincere advice.</p>
<p>So if this type of person is how he is, then maybe be one day, by the permission of Allaah, he will turn back.  And even if he stays upon his innovation, then he does not represent a great danger to the people (he doesn’t call to this innovation).  However what is obligatory is that you strive to give him advice and clarify and give him correct, constructive direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>“As for the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>second category of people, those who are obstinate, those who do so deliberately with pride, they commit innovation, obstinately, deliberately</strong></span>.   The more you forbid him, the more he increases in his error until he becomes a caller to innovation.  Therefore the <em>Salaf </em>used to reject the narrations of an innovator, who was a caller to innovation and not accept them, rather they would reject them and warn against him and against his innovation.  So the like of this person, you must make his affair clear and warn against him.  And if he has written a book, he is refuted with a book.  If he has a tape, he is refuted with a tape.  If he gives speeches, he is refuted in speeches.  The people are warned against his evil. ”</p>
<p>Then after some speech the Shaykh said finishing, “<span style="color:#993300;">So this second type, who is indicated by the author here, he is the most dangerous of people for this nation.  Therefore it is obligatory to warn the people against him and to draw attention to their evil and to warn the nation against their evil.</span> ”<em> </em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> started off by saying that the <em>shayateen</em> from mankind and <em>jinn</em> have misguided many of the slaves of <strong>Allaah</strong> by three mighty deviations that are nothing but lies upon <strong>Allaah</strong>.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Taking people away from the texts i.e The Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad</em> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> to the opinions, desires and allegiances.</li>
<li>Glorifying ignorance amongst the people so much so that it became an objective that the majority of the people be upon that mannerism of ignorance.</li>
<li>Glorifying or thinking of some scholars as being holy and infallible.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result, it is necessary to clarify the straight path of <strong>Allaah</strong> and thus the <em>Shaykh</em> outlined some principles needed by the student of knowledge that he/she can use as a light on the path towards his/her <strong>Lord</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These principles include:-</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Allaah</strong> has clarified to the people the path of truth and the way to know the truth.</li>
<li>It is a must to bring the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad</em> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> above and beyond the intellect and analogy of the people.</li>
<li>It a must to understand the book and the <em>Sunnah</em> upon the understanding of the<em> salaf-us-saalih.</em></li>
<li>It is a must to know that the truth is being upon the understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em> or anybody upon that understanding i.e the scholars of this <em>deen</em> that have followed the first generations in <em>ihsaan</em>(perfection).</li>
<li>We must believe that the truth is always present in every time and every generation and it is not possible that you would have a time, generation or century in which there is no person guiding the people to the truth.</li>
<li>It is a must to know that even though the scholars are those who are guiding the people to the truth, it doesn’t mean that they are infallible and cannot or may not go against the truth even in one single matter.</li>
<li>Whoever tries to seek the proof from the book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, he should never ever leave it for the statement of anybody else regardless of who that person may be but rather he must follow the book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>.</li>
<li>The truth is independent of any man but the truth cannot be known except through the men who transmit it.</li>
<li>If the proof contradicts the statements of men, it is <em>waajib</em> upon us to bring forward the proof ahead of the statements of men.</li>
<li>Whoever is ignorant of the proofs of the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> and understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em>must go back to the rulings of the scholars.</li>
<li>Nobody after the Messenger of <strong>Allaah</strong> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> can be obeyed in everything he commands and forbids.</li>
<li>It is not permissible to say that every <em>mujtahid</em> (one who has the tools and strives to derive rulings from the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em>) is correct. The truth is only one and cannot be more than one.</li>
<li>The people of the <em>Sunnah</em> will suspect/accuse the opinions of people but will never accuse/suspect the religion of <strong>Allaah</strong>.</li>
<li>It is not permissible for anybody to delve into <em>ijtihaad</em> during times of calamity except if he is well qualified and has the capacity to be upon <em>ijtihaad</em>.</li>
<li>It is not correct to use as a proof against those who are calling to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> with the understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em> that the four <em>imaams</em> of the four <em>madhahib</em> have more precedence to be followed than the pious predecessors of this <em>Ummah</em>.</li>
<li>The people of the <em>Sunnah</em> will refute and correct whoever goes against the proofs of the Book and the<em>Sunnah</em> even if the one who went against the proofs is a <em>Shaykh</em> of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE</strong>: It is a must to warn against the people of innovation and desires, to warn against their statements, and this is the way of the companions of <em>Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and those who followed them from the <em>Taabi’oon</em> and those who follow them in <em>ihsaan</em> till the Day of Judgment.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> brought an abundance of proofs from the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> as well as the statements of our pious predecessors in explaining the aforementioned points.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A must listen for those who wish to acquaint themselves with the truth!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to make us align ourselves to the truth and the people of truth and rid us of the sickness of blind following anyone, and to make us avid followers of Muhammad <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Reciter: </strong>Imâm al-Barbahârî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Bear in mind that all whims are evil. They all call to the sword.” </span><em>(Sharh-us-Sunnah 147)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> They call to the sword, that is, to the tribulation. The civil wars and splitting has only been caused by Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’ such as Mu’tazilah, Khawârij and others from among Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’. They are the ones who are responsible for the tribulations; Mu’tazilah, Khawârij, Rawâfidh and others. The tribulations have only been caused by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who killed ‘Uthmân (radhiya Allâhu ‘anh)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who killed ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib (radhiya Allâhu ‘anh)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who caused the tribulations between the Muslims after that if not these Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who was it that got al-Ma’mûn and his successors to put Ahl-us-Sunmnah on trial so that they even dragged their Imâm Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullâh), beat him and imprisoned him if not Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who was it that imprisoned Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh) so that he died in the prison if not these Ahl-ul-Ahwâ’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obliged to beware of these people. Their evil leads to the splitting of the Muslims, rebellion against the Muslim ruler and that the Muslims scatter into sects and groups instead of being one single nation (Ummah).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar:</strong> ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: youtube.com/watch?v=B9jK_y4aWpE<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video</strong>: aFatwa.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: We’re wondering about a few principles. We would like to hear with you whether they agree with the confirmed principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah. <span style="color:#993300;">The first principle is “We correct without criticising (Jarh)”</span>. What do you say about that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is baseless. That principle is baseless. People who stick to that which is false have to be criticised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">The second principle is “If you judge, you will be judged, and if you call, you will be rewarded.”</span> What do you say about this principle?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân:</strong> It is innovated. It is unfounded. People who stick to that which is false have to be judged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">The third principle is: “It is from justice to mention the good and bad sides.”</span> The person argued for it with the known Hadîth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He spoke the truth to you whilst he is a liar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do you say about this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: This is also false. This speech is also false. Allâh mentioned the bad sides of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans or idolaters) without mentioning the good sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Does this also apply to Ahl-ul-Bid’ah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: What about Ahl-ul-Bid’ah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: He says that it is from justice to also mention their good and bad sides…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: It’s the same thing. Their bad sides are mentioned unlike their good ones. Allâh mentioned the bad sides of the enemies without mentioning their good sides.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> Are these ‘Ar’ûr’s principles?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Yes, these are his principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: They are all rejected and false. He has been refuted in several books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">The fifth principle is “It is allowed to say that a person is wrong but it is forbidden to slander him.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: This is just as “We correct without criticizing”. They are the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: He gave an example and asked why <strong>Imâm Ahmad</strong> is not condemned when making Takfîr upon the one who does not perform the prayer whilst <strong>Sayyid Qutb</strong> is condemned when he expresses himself in certain ways so that we say that he makes Takfîr upon the societies while Imâm Ahmad is not condemned when he makes Takfîr upon all these multitudes? What do you say about this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: Imâm Ahmad was incredibly learned. He knew the evidence and how they were to be used. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Sayyid Qutb was ignorant and had no knowledge. He had no evidence for what he said. It is unjust to compare Imâm Ahmad with Sayyid Qutb.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: He also says that he does not know of anybody today in the world who has spoken about methodological matters such as Sayyid Qutb and that most of what he has written is correct. When he was put on the spot, he said that he with “methodological matters” meant affairs of elections and assassinations and that he with “today” meant the fifties…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân:</strong> He does not know. He does not know because he is ignorant. We know – and all praise is due to Allâh – that the scholars before and after Sayyid Qutb do not agree with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> He also says that there exists a call that consists of criticizing the people due to some mistake or unclear utterance and [unclear sound]. What do you say about that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân:</strong> It is empty speech. He wants to whitewash the falsehood and defend those who stick to that which is false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: He says that he who follows up the discord of the groups will find that the reason mostly is the character and not the creed or the methodology. Is that true?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: The reasons are due to the creed and not the character. He wants to cover them up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What do you say about him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân:</strong> He is no scholar at all. He came to Saudi Arabia as a craftsman. He thereafter revealed what he stands by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>: Should we refrain from going to his lessons? He is coming to Europe. Do you advise the Salafi-youth to attend his lessons?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Fawzân</strong>: I advise the Salafî-youth to boycott his lessons and that they do not attend them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al-Fawzān: If you know and are sure about the deviation of a group and are able to, you must warn&#8230;…even if there is a scholar who praises the group.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following question was posed to Shaykh <span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>āli<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> b. Fawzān Al-Fawzān – may Allāh preserve and protect him (&#8220;Sahab Salafi Network&#8221; 2012):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I intend to write about some deviated groups and warn against them. However, these groups have not left the fold of Islām, and some scholars have praised them, and I fear that [such scholars] might call against me<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Aj" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span> What is your advice and guidance for me, knowing that this group is deviated?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your duty (wājib) is to clarify the truth; your duty is to clarify the truth. If you are sure about their errors and their deviation, you are one hundred percent sure, and you have the ability and the knowledge to explain, then it is a duty upon you to do this<a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Aj" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>And when Allāh took the covenant from those who were given the scripture that you must explain it to people and not hide it…  </i></span>(Translation of the meaning of Āl-‘Imrān: 187)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>Verily those who hide the clear guidance that We have revealed…<br />
</i></span>(Translation of the meaning of Al-Baqarah: 159, 174)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed to hide knowledge. If you know and are sure about the deviation of some groups or sects, then clarify them and explain them for the people, so that they may be on guard against them. This is part of na<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ī<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ah (sincere concern for others; advice). The Messenger – Allāh’s praise and peace be upon him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The religion is na<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ī<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ah (sincerity). We asked: “to whom?” He replied, “to Allāh, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their masses. </span></em>(<span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ī<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> Muslim, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adīth #55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In doing so,] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>do not fear the people. You must fear Allāh</strong></span> – the exalted and perfect – and explain the truth and refute falsehood, and not fear people, yes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are notes [not verbatim] from a highly beneficial lesson given by student <strong>Abu Dihyah Dawood Adeeb</strong> (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) two years ago:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nuh&#8217;s wife calling Nuh (&#8216;alayhi salaam) &#8216;crazy&#8217; is a direct criticism of Nuh (&#8216;alayhi salaam) and an indirect criticism of Allaah and an indirect criticism of the message of Nuh. &#8230;When Allaah inspired Nuh, his wife would spread namima, calling him &#8216;crazy.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَدُّوا لَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with you.</span> (Al-Qalam, ayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn Katheer (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said about this ayah that it means: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>T</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>hey want you to be quiet about their gods and abandon the truth you are upon</strong></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The disbelievers and Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah wish that those relaying the truth and forbidding falsehood cease doing so.] And this is exactly what happens to the &#8216;ulemma of Ahlus-Sunnah, specifically, and on another level the students and the du&#8217;aat (callers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In regards to the callers dealing with other Muslims, it means [Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah desiring] abandoning talking about their [Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah&#8217;s] deviation, abandoning talking about their extremism, abandoning talking about their heresies, abandoning talking about their misguidance, or not saying the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong> (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said in his tafseer of this ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">لَوْ تُدْهِنُ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you should compromise with them</span> : This is <a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1oY" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>al-Mudahana</em></strong></span></a>, and it is to renounce or compromise something from the Religion to please those people [kufaar or Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah], renouncing or giving up something from the Religion to please those people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; This means [that people of kufr desire that] Ahlul-Islaam making <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> with Ahlul-Kufaar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; (Or) coming down a notch, this means [that people of bid&#8217;ah desire that] Ahlus-Sunnah making <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> with Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; (Or) it could also be the people of Islaam with both the kufaar and Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Fawzaan</strong> said: [Allaah said:]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَدُّوا لَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with you<strong>.</strong></span> (Al-Qalam, ayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Kufaar would like you to compromise, for if you were to incline just a little bit, you would give them what [they] want. So you would compromise with them, and them with you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِيَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَه ُ وَإِذا ً لاَتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلا </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed (the Qur`an) unto you (O Muhammad), to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you a friend! </span>(Al-Isra`, ayah 73)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَلَوْلاَ أَنْ ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدْتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئا ً قَلِيلا</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little. </span>(Al-Isra`, ayah 74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you compromise, it opens the door for more <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong>, so you end up making <strong><em>Tamyee&#8217;</em></strong> (watering down the Religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Fawzaan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">إِذا ً لَأَذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ الْحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ الْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيرا</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span> </strong>(Al-Isra`, ayah 75)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is warning the most pious, righteous, God-fearing man who ever walked on the face of the earth [Prophet Muhammad, salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam], so how much more us, the Salafiyoon of America. Meaning you cannot mix (compromise) or water down this <strong><em>Risala</em></strong> (message).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَلاَ تَرْكَنُوا إِلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا فَتَمَسَّكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَاءَ ثُمَّ لاَ تُنصَرُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And incline not toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire should touch you, and you have no protectors other than Allaah, nor you would then be helped<strong>. </strong>(Hud, ayah 113)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Fawzaan said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Muslim does not haggle or bargain with his Religion ever!</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">ادْعُ إِلَى سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islaam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Inspiration and the Qur`an) and fair preaching&#8230; </span>(An-Nahl, ayah 125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, you should call to Allaah with wisdom and beautiful exhortation, but he [the true Salafee caller] never relinquishes or renounces anything of his religion to please and satisfy the disbelievers (and deviant Muslims). We don&#8217;t compromise <span style="text-decoration:underline;">anything</span> from Salafiyyah, Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And we as Muslims don&#8217;t compromise, lower, relinquish, foregoe anything of the Sunnah and Salafiyyah and its principles for the people of bid&#8217;ah</strong></span>. If we don&#8217;t (remain firm) with Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah, then how in the world are we going to (remain firm) when dealing with disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, you give da&#8217;wah &#8211; <span style="font-size:x-large;">ادْعُ إِلَى سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ</span> &#8211; but the methodology must be correct; he doesn&#8217;t compromise <span style="text-decoration:underline;">anything </span>from the Deen to please the kufaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who doesn&#8217;t come to Islaam, except by relinquishing or foregoing anything of the Religion, he&#8217;s not going to come. We don&#8217;t desire him anyway. We are not to transgress the bounds regards our Deen because our Deen will never accept bargaining or haggling or compromise with something from the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَدُّوا لَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with you<strong>.</strong></span> (Al-Qalam, ayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Fawzaan said: <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> means : relinquishing something from the Deen for the pleasure or consent of the kufaar (or Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Abu Dihyah also relayed from Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan some of the <em><strong>Mudahana</strong></em> that Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah boldly commit today, such as when they call other Muslims to not call the disbelievers &#8220;kufaar&#8221; (disbelievers) or &#8220;mushrikoon&#8221; (polytheists), but instead to call them &#8220;non-Muslim.&#8221; Or even when some of them they seek to change the address of Allaah in the Qur`an, such as Allaah&#8217;s address in Sooratul Kaafiroon. Some of them say, &#8220;Do not say (as Allaah says what means): &#8216;<strong>Oh you disbelievers</strong>,&#8217; but say &#8216;<em>Oh you non-Muslims</em>.'&#8221; [Aoodhubillaah!] Some of them say, &#8220;Do not say (as Allaah says what means): &#8216;<strong>I do not worship what you worship</strong>,&#8217; but say &#8216;<em>I do not pray as you pray,</em>&#8216; or &#8216;<em>I do not give charity as you give charity.</em>&#8216;&#8221; [Aoodhubillaah!]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They call others to change the religious address.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Fawzaan said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the address of Allaah in the Qur`an? This is the address of Allaah, and you want us to change it? This kind of speech is not permissible ever! Never!! Not permissible.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> is haram, because it is relinquishing something of the Religion to please the disbelievers (or Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Mudarat</em>, it is permissible with need to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> is to relinquish or foregoe something from the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Mudarat</em> </strong>is giving them something to repel their evil without relinquishing anything from the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Batal (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: &#8220;<em>Mudarat</em> is from the good characteristics of the believers, to be responsive to people even with a word, without being coarse with them in speech. This is one of the strongest causes of harmony. Some people think that <em>Mudarat</em> is <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong>, and this is an error! As <em>Mudara</em> is regrettable, whereas Mudahana is prohibited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference is <strong>Mudahana</strong> is taken from the word <strong><em>Dahan</em></strong>. A <em>Dahan</em> is a painter, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who glosses over something and covers what is actually there</span>. The scholars have explained it [<strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong>] as: lying with a sinner and openly displaying happiness with what he is doing without forbidding him at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Mudara</em> </strong>is being kind with the ignorant in order to teach him, being kind to the sinner in order to forbid him what he&#8217;s doing without being harsh, so that he does not expose what he does, and forbidding him with gentle speech and action, especially if his comradship is needed and the likes of it.&#8221; [FatHul-Baari by Ibn Hajar, who quoted Ibn Battal]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam al-Qurtubi (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: &#8220;The difference between <em>Mudara</em> and <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> is that Mudara is to surrender the dunya for the benefit of the Deen, and it is permissible and even recommended. And <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> is leaving the Deen (or something of the Deen) for the dunya.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibnul-Qayyim (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: &#8220;Therefore <em>Mudara</em> is praiseworthy, and <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> is censured. So there is a difference between the two. The one who is Mudari uses kindness with a person in order for the truth to manifest from the person or make him retract from falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong><em>Mudahana</em></strong> (the flaterrer and comprimiser) uses kindness in order for the person to remain established upon falsehood and leaves him upon his desires. <strong>Mudara is for the people of Eeman, while <em>Mudahana</em> is for the <span style="color:#c00000;">hypocrites</span>.</strong>&#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If the heretic started mentioning his bid’ah right at the beginning of the sitting, you would be on your guard and flee from him, but what he does is begin by mentioning hadīth from the <span style="color:#008000;">Sunnah</span>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All Major Innovations and Deviations Begin Small and Insignificant Beware of small innovations because they grow until they become large.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the case with every innovation introduced in this Ummah. It began as something small, bearing resemblance to the truth which is why those who entered it were mislead and then were unable to leave it. So it grew and became the religion which they followed and thus deviated from the Straight Path and left Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] A striking example of how small innovations lead a  person into committing major innovations is found in the narration reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hakam bin al-Mubaarak informed us that Amr ibn Yahyaa said my father related from his father who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We used to sit by the door of &#8216;Abdullah ibn Mas&#8217;ood before the Salaatul Ghadaat (morning prayer), so that when he came out we would walk with him to the masjid. (One day) Aboo Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree came to us and said, &#8220;Has Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; Therefore, he sat down with us until he came out. When he came out, we all stood along with him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so Abu Moosaa said to him, &#8220;O Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan I have just seen something in the masjid which I deemed to be evil, but all praise is for Allaah, I did not see anything except good!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He inquired, &#8220;Then what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Aboo Moosaa) replied, &#8220;If you live you will see it. I saw in the masjid people sitting in circles awaiting the Prayer. In each circle they had pebbles in their hands and a man would say &#8216;repeat Allaahu Akbar a hundred times.&#8217; So they would repeat it a hundred times. Then he would say, &#8216;say Laa ilaaha illallaah a hundred times.&#8217; So they would say it a hundred times. Then he would say, &#8216;say Subhaanallaah a hundred times.&#8217; So they would say it a hundred times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) asked, &#8220;What did you say to them?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Aboo Moosaa) said, &#8220;I did not say anything to them. Instead I waited to hear you view or what you declared.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) replied, &#8220;Would that you had ordered them to count up the evil deeds they acquired and assured them that their good deeds would not be lost!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we went along with him (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) until he came to one of these circles and stood and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What is this which I see you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They replied, &#8220;O Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan! These are pebbles upon which we are counting takbeer, tahleel and tasbeeh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;(You should) count your evil deeds and I will assure you that none of your good deeds will be lost. Woe to you, O Ummah of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)! How quickly you are rushing to your destruction! These are the Companions of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and who are widespread (and numerous). There are his clothes which have not yet decayed and his eating utensils which are unbroken. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! Either you are upon a deen better guided than the Deen of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) or that you are opening the door of misguidance (from this bid&#8217;ah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, &#8220;O Aboo Abdur-Rahmaan! By Allaah, we only intended good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;How many there are who intend good but do not achieve it. Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Messenger said to us &#8216;A people will recite the Qur&#8217;aan but it will not pass beyond their throats.&#8217; By Allaah! I do not know, perhaps most of them are from you.&#8221; Then he left them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar ibn Salamah (the sub-narrator) said: &#8220;We saw most of those people fighting against us on the day of Nahrawaan, along with the Khawaarij.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the introduction of ad-Daarimee, volume one, page 73 with an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The scholars differentiate between those innovations which take  a person outside the fold of Islaam (al-Bid&#8217;atul-Mukaffirah) and those which do not. So this is not to be understood unrestrictedly.</p>

by Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT IN AL-QAWL-UL-MUFEED FEE ADILLATIT TAWHEED:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Du’aah Ilaa Bid’atihim (Caller to the innovation).</li>
<li>Ghayr Du’aah Ilayhaa (Those who do not call to it).</li>
</ol>
<p>See Hadee as-Saaree of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (rahimahullaah) page 385.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that the majority of the scholars are upon this division of the people of innovation:</p>
<ol>
<li>those who call to their innovation and</li>
<li>those who do not call to their innovation.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is mandatory upon us that we take caution from both categories. And the first category of people are more hazardous to the general people than the second category. And even the second category, those who do not call to their innovation, then caution must still be taken from them, for verily a person can be fooled by a particular persons’ statements and actions, because even though he may not be calling to his innovation directly and explicitly, but his actions and deeds are calling to his innovation, and this is very harmful to the slaves of Allaah, and they must take caution from this. And from the way of the Salaf was that they used to have complete caution from all types of people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">From Sa’eed ibn ‘Aamir who said: “I heard Ismaa’eel [i.e. Ibn Khaarijah] narrate, saying: ‘Two men from the people of the innovated sects came to Muhammad Ibn Seereen and said: “O Aboo Bakr we want to narrate something to you.” He said: “No.” They said: “Then may we recite an Aayah from Allaah’s book to you?” He said: “No, not even half of an Aayah!” He said: “Either you two get up and leave or I will get up.” So the two men stood up and left. So one of the people said: “What harm would it do to you for him to recite an Aayah?” He said: “I hated that he should recite an Aayah and that they would distort it and then it would enter my heart.”</span> [Reported in Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah of Imaam al-Laalikaa’ee, no. 242.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that Ibn Seereen (rahimahullaah) was scared that something might fall into his heart from the beautiful words of that person of innovation, even though he was not calling to his innovation. So the way of the Salaf is that the people of innovation, the Ahlul-Bid’ah, are not to be sat with, and they are not to be listened to, and Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has made Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in sufficiency, and there is no need for the people of innovation, whether they are calling to their innovation or are not calling to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are those who say concerning the people of innovation that we take from them [i.e. the Ahlul-Bid’ah] that which is good, and we leave off the evil that is with them. And Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned that this is a false statement, and it is an incorrect statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what is correct is that we do not take from the people of innovation in entirety</strong></span>. And there are great dangers in this [i.e. this false statement that we take the good and leave the bad], and the Shaykh mentioned a story that one of the early Salaf wanted to marry a woman who was known to be from a sect of the Khawaarij. And he hoped that by marrying her he might win her over to the Sunnah, but when he did marry her, it turned out that in fact she had pulled him to the beliefs of the Khawaarij.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tirmidhi #76 records on the authority of Nawwas ibn Sam&#8217;an that the messenger of Allah (sallallahu alyhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Allah has set forth the following as a parable:</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is a road that leads straight to the destination. On either side of the road there is a wall in which there are open doors with curtains hanging on them. From the remote end of the road, a voice calls, &#8216;proceed straight and do not turn aside&#8217;. Whenever someone intends to lift a curtain from the door another voice calls from above. &#8216;Beware! Do not lift the curtain; otherwise you will be lured inside&#8217;. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The prophet (sallallahu alyhi wa sallaam) explained the parable by saying that the straight path is Islam. the walls are the limits imposed by Allah, the open doors are the things that He has prohibited, the voice which calls from the end of the road is the Quran and the voice which calls from above is Allah&#8217;s monitor in the heart of every believer&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was declared Hasan Gharib by Tirmidhee and sahih by Hakim #245 with Dhahabi agreeing and Al-Albani , Sahih al-Jami&#8217; #3887</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Who will have a worse punishment (in the Hereafter): The sinners or the innovators?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innovators will have a worse punishment, since innovations are worse than sins. Innovations are more beloved to the Devil than sins because (it is likely that) the sinner may repent &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan Ath-Thawree, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees (the Devil) than sins. This is because sins are repented from whereas innovations are not repented from.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa (11/472))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily Allaah has prevented repentance from every person of innovation.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (1620))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; but as for the innovator, then very rarely does he repent because he thinks that he is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is contrary to the sinner for he knows that he is disobeying Allaah and that he is committing a sinful deed. As for the innovator, he considers himself to be obeying Allaah and to be upon obedience. This is why innovation – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – is worse than sin. And this is why the Salaf warned the people from sitting and gathering with the innovators –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Al-Hasan Al-Basree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do not sit with a person of innovation, for indeed he will put a disease in your heart.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-I’tisaam of Ash-Shaatibee (1/72) verified by Saleem Al-Hilaalee and Al-Bid’a wan-Nahee ‘anhaa of Ibn Waddaah (pg. 54))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaatibee (158) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed the saved sect – and they are Ahl-us-Sunnah – are commanded to disassociate themselves from the people of innovations, to expel them, and to punish severely anyone that follows in their direction, whether by killing them or less than that. And the scholars have warned us against accompanying and gathering with them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (the compiler) say : may Allaah have mercy on the Salaf (predecessors). They did not leave behind any person of innovation except that they subdued him and warned against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; for they would influence those whom they sat with, and their danger is great. There is no doubt that innovation is worse than sin and that the danger of the innovator is worse to the people than the danger of the sinner. &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the danger of the people of innovation, Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the danger of them [meaning the innovators], the Religion would have been corrupted. Their corruption is worse than the corruption caused by the conquering of the enemies at times of war. For indeed, when they conquer, they do not corrupt hearts or the Religion found in them, except for a while. But as for these people [i.e. the innovators], then they corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa: (28/232)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Ibn Taimiyyah) also said (20/103):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The people of innovation are worse than the people of lustful sins, according to the Sunnah and the Ijmaa’ (consensus).”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8211; This is why the Salaf would say:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Being moderate while upon the Sunnah is better than exerting oneself while upon Innovation.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This statement is reported from Ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him. Refer to Al-Laalikaa’ee (1/188, no. 114), Al-Ibaanah (1/320, no. 161) and As-Sunnah of Ibn Nasr (30).]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: : Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.7 &#8211; <a title="# The Beginnings of Deviation (Al Istiqaamah Magazine)" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/17/beginnings_of_deviation/">The Beginnings of Deviation</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That <em>Shirk</em> began during the time of Noah &#8216;alayhis-salaam, due to the excessive love and veneration that the people had for certain dead pious Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.654H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said: &#8220;The initial images that were made of these righteous men were done in order that the people could be reminded about their righteousness and so strive in being righteous; as they strove. So they worshipped Allaah by the graves of these righteous men. Then a people came after them who forgot the intent of their fore-fathers&#8217; actions. So Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these images and held them in great veneration.&#8221;13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: &#8220;That Shaytaan is eager to misguide mankind and to plot against them. He comes from the angle of exploiting man&#8217;s emotions, and lures them into doing acts that are (apparently) good. Thus, when Shaytaan saw amongst the people of Noah their great love and esteem for the righteous, he tricked them into going beyond the bounds in their love, and he got them to make and place statues of these dead pious Muslims in their places of gatherings. The objective of this was to make them swerve away from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: That Shaytaan does not only observe the present generation, and seek to deceive only them; but he also wishes to misguide and deceive future generations. Thus, when he could not plunge the present generation, from the people of Noah, into Shirk, he eagerly awaited the next generation&#8217;s arrival, in order that he could misguide them.&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: That the worshipping of dead pious Muslims continues to be practiced amongst the <em>Ummah</em> even today. The difference being is that the names have changed. Thus, instead of worshipping <em>Wadd</em>, or <em>Yaghooth</em>, or <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>; people have instead directed the same practices of <em>Shirk</em> &#8211; like supplicating directly to the pious dead, and taking them as intercessors between them and Allaah &#8211; to others; such as to Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee in Iraaq, or al-Baydaawee in Eygypt, or Chishtee in India, etc. However, changing the name of a thing, does not change its reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez </strong><strong>Ibn Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> have prohibited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one</strong></span>. Thus, <span style="color:#ff6600;">if the difference involves a particular issue of <strong>ijtihaad</strong> wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a <strong>clear text of the Book and the Sunnah</strong>, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner</span>, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8221; </span>[Soorah at-Towbah 9:71].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do this, then with his tongue, and if he is unable to do this, then with his heart. And that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</em> </span></p>
<p>And he <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Whosoever directs a person to do good, will have a reward similar to the one who does that good.&#8221;</em> </span>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>aayaat</em> (verses) and <em>ahaadeeth</em> with this meaning are plenty.&#8221; [6]</p>
