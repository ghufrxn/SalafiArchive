<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 62 : Point 107</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa salam</em>) and that which his Companions and the Jamaa’ah were upon is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation and his body is relaxed and his religion is safe, if Allah wills, since the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “<span style="color:#800000;">My Ummah will split…</span>” and the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) told us which would be the saved sect, saying, “<span style="color:#800000;">That which I and my Companions are upon</span>” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. This is the cure, the explanation, the clear affair and the straight and distinct road. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of going to extremes and harshness. Beware of exaggeration and cling to the ancient religion” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2643) and others and it is hasan, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is not a hadeeth of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), but is a saying of Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) as reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/50/nos.144. 145), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (10/252) and Ibn Nasr in as-Sunnah (no.85) and others and is saheeh as such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“Beware of exaggeration in the religion for, indeed, those before you were destroyed due to exaggeration in the religion.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, an-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah and it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“ Those who go to extremes are destroyed.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 3/1294/no.4591) and it is saheeh</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 90A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects; all of them shall be in the Fire except one, and it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth.” It was said, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “That which I and my companions are upon today.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/my-ummah-will-divide-into-73-sects-all-of-them-shall-be-in-the-fire-except-one" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects, all of them in the Fire except one and it is <em>al-Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded us to unite; to become <em>ijtimaa</em>` upon the truth.</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling together to the rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who split up their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is just with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do. </strong>(</span>Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>159)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not be like those who split and differed after the clear signs have come to them. And they are the ones for whom will be a tremendous punishment. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He forbade us from splitting and He commanded us with uniting and with clinging on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight way so follow it and do not follow the divergent paths for they will split you and lead you away from His path.</span> </strong>(Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to split and differ on account of desires or on account of <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) fathers and forefathers or as a result of blindly following the Jews and the Christians. Differing is not permissible in the matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) and in the fundamentals of the religion. Rather, it is obligatory to agree and to be united with regard to it. As for differing in issues of <em>fiqh</em> then this occurs. However, it is obligatory to return and refer back to those sayings which the proof establishes. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you dispute about anything then refer it back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and finer in its outcome.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <em>ikhtilaaf</em> (differing) in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is not permissible because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon text). It is not a place for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deduction). But as for the issues of <em>fiqh</em> and <em>istinbaat</em> (deduction of rulings) then in that case, each one of the People of Knowledge in that matter who are suitable to promote <em>ijtihaad</em> can strive to deduce rulings and they may differ in their outlooks. However, they should not just remain upon their differing. Rather, they should refer back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So, whoever has proof then they should follow him and take his saying and leave their own opinions. This is the position of the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and this is what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> directed us to. As for our saying, leave the people and let everyone have his own opinion and the differing of the nation is a mercy as they say then we say <em>haathaa baatil </em>(this is false and futile). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will continue to disagree except for those who your Lord has mercy upon.</span> </strong>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>118-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, <strong>“Except for those who your Lord has mercy upon,” </strong>indicates that those whom Allaah has mercy upon do not differ and that differing is a punishment (<em>a<u>th</u>aab)</em> and is not a mercy (a <em>ra<u>h</u>mah)</em>. Mercy is for those who do not differ and if they do differ then they refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and they take what is correct and they leave what is wrong. This is the way of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for each one remaining upon his own opinion and what so and so said and so and so then this is not the way of the Muslims. This is the way of the <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa</em> (innovated sects) and the People of <em>Shahawaat</em> (followers of desires). They search for whatever saying will conform to their desires and whatever will conform to what they want and whatever differs with their desires, they abandon it even if the Imaam whom they say that they take his saying says it. Meaning, they do not accept from the sayings of the Imaams and the scholars except what is in accordance with their desires. As for what contradicts their desires then they reject it. So, this is a proof that they are just following their own desires, whatever conforms with their desires they accept it and whatever is contrary to their desires they abandon it. <em>Wa laa <u>h</u>awla wa laa quwatta illaa billaah</em> (and there is no movement and no ability except with the aid of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is called to nowadays in the newspapers and magazines and meetings and conferences mostly and upon the channels. They promote disagreement and they say we are just making things open and easy for the people. With what are we making things open and easy for the people? With abandonment of the Book and the Sunnah and with going along with sayings whose people are not secure from error; those who make errors sometimes and are correct sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they; meaning the Imaams of the past, they forbade us from taking their sayings except what accords with the proof. They forbade us from taking their sayings, which are in contrary to the proof. So, this is a matter, which it is obligatory to be aware of because the people today have been put to trial on account of those people who confuse things for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one,” </strong></span>This <u>h</u>adeeth is authentic, when its chains of narration are gathered and its many narrations and the Imaams reported in their works and speak in praise of it and actual circumstances testify to its truth. So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that this nation of Muhammad will split into 73 sects and these are the major fundamental sects and there are actually more than these sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said all of them will be in the Fire, meaning the 72, all of them will be in the Fire except for one and it is the 73<sup>rd</sup> one, which is that which is upon the like of what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon. So it is what will be saved from the Fire. And therefore, they are called <strong><em>al-Firqatun Naajiyah</em></strong> (the saved sect) and they are called <strong><em>Ahl-us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em></strong> (the People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>); the united body upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is beside them then they are opposers to the truth under the threat of the Hellfire. So from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>fisq</em> (evil doing) and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>ma`<u>s</u>iyyah</em> (sin, disobedience). They are not all the same with regard to entering the Fire. So it is not to be taken from this <u>h</u>adeeth that these sects, all of them are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body,”</span> </strong><em>Al-Jamaa`ah</em> (united body) is whoever is upon the truth even if it is a single person. This is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the united body). As for <em>Al-Kathrah</em> (being numerous on its own); a group being numerous then this on its own does not indicate the truth. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to obey most of those upon the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of mankind even if you eagerly wish will not be believers.</span> </strong>(Soorah Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِن وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have not found most of them to be true to their covenant, We have found most of them to be disobedient ones. </strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being numerous is not what is counted. What is counted is those who are upon the truth even if they are few in number, even if it is a single person then he will be the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the body upon the truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>It was said, “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah? He said, “That which is upon that which I and my companions are upon today.” </strong></span>This is the correct path, those who are upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, they are the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> (the united body upon the truth).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The author rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established all of the Religion, and it has become clear to the people. So it is upon the people to comply and to follow.”</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-sunnah-the-jamaaah-have-firmly-established-all-of-the-religion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, <strong>“That is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah have firmly established all of the Religion.”</strong> “That” indicating what has preceded with regard to the encouragement upon adhering to the way of the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has preceded that what is meant by Ahlus-Sunnah (the People of the Sunnah), are those who adhere to the Sunnah of the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and to his way. They are the people of the Sunnah. And the Jamaa&#8217;ah, they are those who come together upon the Truth and they do not split.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the evidence for this:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling all of you together to the Rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aal `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they gathered upon the Truth and they do not separate away from it. And they do not disagree and differ concerning it. They are the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for: <strong>Those who split up their religion, and they are sects&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah the Majestic and Most High says to His Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;then you have nothing to do with them at all. Their affair is for Allaah; then He will inform them of what they used to do.”</span></strong> (Sooratul- An&#8217;aam (6), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established (ahkamaa),”</strong> meaning they have precisely established; so ihkaam means precision; they have precisely established the whole of the affair of the Religion. All of it is contained within the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah. Just as He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever lives long from amongst you, then he will see very great differing so adhere to my Sunnah.”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing will protect from the evil of this differing except adherence to/clinging onto the Sunnah of the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. And it is what the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon in `aqeedah (creed and belief) and in `ibaadah (worship) and in dealings and in behaviour and in manners. And they are the Saved Sect, from amongst the 73 sects; all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Which it is, O Messenger of Allaah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this one which is exempted from amongst these sects, it is a distinctive group; who is it? He sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said in explanation of it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever is upon the like of what I am upon and my Companions.”</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon is the Sunnah. So whoever adheres to it will be saved; and therefore they are called ‘The Saved Sect’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it has become clear to the people. So therefore it is upon the people to do ittibaa` (to comply and follow).”</strong> It has become clear to the people, that the affair of the Religion, all of it, lies in adherence to the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah. So no one will oppose what the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah were upon except for the people of misguidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So what is there after the Truth, except for misguidance. </span></strong>(Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever leaves off the Truth he will fall into misguidance; and the Truth is what the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah are upon to the exclusion of others besides them.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[01]</strong> This is a part of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah, radiyAllaahu`anhu and its checking has already preceded (page 46).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It is a hadeeth which is declared saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[02]</strong> Reported by at-Tirmithee in his Sunan and Ibn Nasr al-Marwazee in as-Sunnah and al-Haakim in alMustadrak and al-Aajurree in ash-Sharee`ah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah&#8230; (and many others). At-Tirmithee said the hadeeth is hasan ghareeb mufassar, a hadeeth which is hasan with a singular chain which explains the other narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee discussed this hadeeth and declared (it) hasan. It has enough supporting witnesses to support the hadeeth, that it is declared hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[03]</strong> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said on this point (point 3), “He, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, “And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established the whole affair of the Religion, and it has become clear to the people. So what is upon the people is to follow/comply”. I say, the `aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is clear in its source references and it is tied to the Sunnah and its people. So whomever Allaah wishes good for, then he guides him to those source books. And he makes easy for him to be a companion of the carriers of this `aqeedah, and I mean by it, carriers upon the way of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa`ah. And whoever Allaah wishes evil for then He makes easy for him whatever he was created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the Soofees and the people of <strong>Soofism</strong> then he will think that that is right guidance and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the `aqeedah of the <strong>Jahmiyyah</strong> and he lives upon it and accompanies its people, he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the ideas of the <strong>Mu`tazilah</strong>, he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the `aqeedah of the <strong>Ash`arees</strong> he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of <strong>rafd (the Raafidah)</strong>, and the <strong>Shee`ah</strong>, those who curse and abuse the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and belittle them, he will think that that is the Truth he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the <strong>Khawaarij</strong> those who declare the Muslims to be kaafirs (disbelievers), he will think that that is the Truth he will go astray and lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“However the people of these deviant sects they must necessarily find certain gaps/flaws/faults in their `aqeedah, which should make clear to them the deficiencies in the methodology which they are upon in belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise the people of irjaa· (the <strong>Murji·ah</strong>), and likewise the people who are upon the present day calls which give attention just to virtuous acts, and they treat (matters of) `aqeedah lightly, so that the people think that they are upon the Truth, because they see them outwardly adhering; whilst they actually stay away themselves from the very foundation of `aqeedah (creed and belief) and they incite others to avoid it, which is tawheed, the tawheed of worship, (Towheed al-Uloohiyyah). They have nothing to do with it, and they keep other people away from it as well; and they treat lightly whatever infringes it or diminishes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So what is important is that whoever wishes salvation, should adhere to the Book of Allah, then to the books of the Sunnah; and they are well known such as the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree,and the Saheeh of Muslim and the Sunan al-Arba&#8217; (The four Sunan), the Musnad of Imam Ahmad. And what follow from that, from the books of hadeeth, and those books that gather the narrations of the Salaf such as: the Musannaf of Ibn Abee Shaybah, and the Musannaf of `Abdur-Razzaaq, and the Musannaf of Sa&#8217;eed ibn Mansoor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the books of `aqeedah (creed and belief) such as: At-Towheed of Ibn Khuzaymah, and such as ArRadd `alal-Jahmiyyah, (The refutation of the Jahmiyyah) of Imaam Ahmad, Kitaabus-Sunnah (the Book of the Sunnah) of `Abdullaah the son of (Imaam) Ahmad, Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah (Refutation of the Jahmiyyah) by `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed Ad-Daarimee, Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah of al-Laalikaa·ee, al-Ibaanatul-Kubraa of Ibn Battah, and the books of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, and of IbnulQayyim, and of Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab and other than that from the books. These are the books which make the Truth clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of slipping away with the hizbiyyeen, (the sectarians, the people of partisanship) of taking their books and then following their restricted path, and proceeding upon their crooked methodology. “Beware, O my brother Muslim, of taking the books of those people, because their truth is mixed with falsehood and the Sunnah which they have is mixed with bid`ah (innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you want the pure fountain with no pollution in it, then adhere to the Book of Allaah, and to the books of the Sunnah and to the books of the narrations. And follow the way of the people of the narrations (Ahlul-Athar), those who take knowledge with its chain of narration going all the way back to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam from their Prophet salawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh. Whatever they said does not contradict the Truth which they were upon. So here you will know the saying of the author, “And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have clearly/precisely established the affair of the Religion, all of it, and the Truth has become clear to the people, so it is upon the people to follow and to leave off innovating.” Therefore you will know that this is speech which is fully appropriate, and it is binding upon you also to abandon the books of the people of innovation if you want salvation for yourself. May Allaah guide and grant me and you that we take on board the Truth and that we abandon every falsehood; and Allaah grants success.” (Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lilBarbahaaree)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam Allaama Shaykh Rabee bin Hadi al-Madkhali -hafidhullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We advise the Salafis to have harmony/solidarity and to adhere to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To have brotherhood upon what is contained in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam of Aqeedah, worship and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having brotherhood for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal and to have Eemaan in these principles and these foundations and to love each other for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If a person makes a mistake whether it is a minor one or a major one, advice is given with wisdom and good admonition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are people who make a claim of Salafeeyah, they are hard and forceful with falsehood, with slander and oppression. They are harsh and hard when being harsh is not required and they have no wisdom whatsoever, nor mercy or any of these things!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">With sadness some people accuse the established Salafis with this exaggeration! This is extreme oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah we wage war against this harshness, the harshness of the Khawarij, we criticize these people who are extreme and delve too deeply and also the harsh ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize those who water-down, belittle and wage war against the principles of Islaam who originate, derive and produce false, unintelligent principles and statements to protect the people of Bida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize this extremist and we call to the straight path and to that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon of beliefs, actions and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are extremists in watering-down, belittling and warring against the principles of Islam and the others are extremists in declaring people innovators and making Takfeer of people, so both of these types deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah ordered us to have moderation and justice and to be steadfast upon the straight path.&#8217;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and <strong>solid proof</strong> and <strong>beneficial wisdom</strong> in your <em>Dawa’</em>. You should have all the noble and <strong>beautiful manners</strong> encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>knowledge</strong> more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah’s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now – O brothers – I advise you with two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘<strong>Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia</strong>.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country – whether in the university or other than it – or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding – entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> – but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa’</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a unanimous agreement amongst Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah that it is an obligation to stick to the <strong>Jamaa&#8217;ah </strong>[1] and that it is forbidden to break away from it, and that sticking to it is a virtue while separating oneself away from it is a vice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many evidences from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, reaching the level of tawaatur, have been reported concerning this, and likewise there are many narrations from the Salaf with this regard. Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim [2] said: &#8220;My father narrated to me saying: &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Alee As-Sairafee informed me, saying: &#8216;Abdu Rabbihi Ibn Baariq Al-Hanafee &#8211; and he praised him with good &#8211; narrated to me, saying: Simaak Ibn Al-Waleed Al-Hanafee narrated to me that he met Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in Madeenah and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What do you say about a ruler who governs us, yet oppresses and abuses us, shall we not prevent him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8216;No, obey him, O Hanafee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8216;O Hanafee, the Jamaa&#8217;ah, the Jamaa&#8217;ah! Indeed, the nations that came before you were only destroyed because of their splitting up. Did you not hear Allaah say: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;'&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah said in his Tafseer:[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The expressions of the scholars of Tafseer have varied with regard to the meaning of this (part of the) ayah <b>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah.&#8217;</b> So Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas Ibn Maalik narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Indeed, the tribe of Israa&#8217;eel split up into seventy-one sects. And my ummah (nation) will split up into seventy-two sects &#8211; all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it was said to him: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which is this (saved) one?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) clenched his fist and said: <b>&#8216;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited the ayah: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together.&#8217;</b>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said in one of his khutbahs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;All of you together, adhere to obedience (of Allaah) and the Jamaa&#8217;ah, for indeed it is the Rope of Allaah that He has commanded us with.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah that He commanded us to hold onto is the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah refers to the Book of Allaah.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ad-Dahhaak also said this. And other things have been said, all of which are similar to what has been mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b><i>jamee&#8217;an</i></b> (all of you together) is connected to the command &#8216;Itasimoo (Hold onto), so the meaning becomes: <b>&#8216;Be united upon your mutual holding of it (the Rope of Allaah).&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;And be not divided&#8217;</b> refers to the kind of division that leads to not uniting for Jihaad and for protecting the Religion and the Word of Allaah. This is the dividing that comes from tribulations (fitan) and dividing in matters of Creed.&#8221; [End of Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah&#8217;s words, rahimahullaah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that their differing on the tafseer of the part of the verse: <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> is a differing indicating variety in meaning, not a contradiction in meaning, as has been indicated here by Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah, Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr and other muhaqqiqeen. And his interpreting it to be the Book of Allaah combines all of the mentioned statements (of the Salaf). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubee mentioned in his Tafseer[6] the opinion of those who say that the <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> means the Qur&#8217;aan and the opinion of those who say it means the Jamaa&#8217;ah. Then he said: &#8220;The intended meanings are all close and similar for indeed Allaah commands unity and forbids division. This is since division is destruction while the Jamaa&#8217;ah is salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The <b>&#8216;Rope of Allaah&#8217;</b> has been interpreted as Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan), His Religion, Islaam, Sincerity, His Command, His covenant, Obedience to Him and as the Jamaa&#8217;ah. All of these sayings have been stated by the Companions and those who followed them in goodness until the Day of Judgement. And all of it is correct, for the Qur&#8217;aan commands towards the Religion of Islaam &#8211; and this is Allaah&#8217;s Command, His covenant and obedience to Him. And adhering to it <i>jamee&#8217;an</i> (in a unified group) can only be done with the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And the Religion of Islaam in reality is Sincerity to Allaah.&#8221; [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it is understood that their sayings (i.e. of the Salaf) in their interpretation of <b>&#8220;The Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> are not contradictory of one another but rather each saying compliments the other such that Allaah&#8217;s intended meaning becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree reported in his Tafseer [8] that Qataadah said concerning the ayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not be divided &#8211; and remember Allaah&#8217;s blessing on you.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Allaah hates that you be divided &#8211; and He forbade you from it. And He loves that you hear and obey and (stick to) the Jamaa&#8217;ah. So love for yourselves what Allaah loves for you &#8211; if you are able. And there is no might except by (the leave of) Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih ibn Abdul-Azeez Aal us-Shaykh<br />
</strong><strong>Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="715" height="403" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiqNApZ2AHM?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Shaykh Saalih ibn Abdul-Azeez Aal us-Shaykh:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em>, this word was coined at the end of the second generation after <em>Hijri</em> by the followers of the narrations [<em>Aathaar</em>], and the opponents to the various sects that left the way of the companions [<em>Sahaabah</em>] and their students [<em>Taabi&#8217;een</em>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And the first to use it [terminology] were some of the teachers of Al Bukharee – <em>rahimahumuAllaah</em> – and they joined the two words <strong>as-Sunnah</strong> and <strong>al-Jamaa’ah</strong> because there are those who call towards following <em>Sunnah</em> but they might not be with the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>. And there are those who call towards <em>Jamaa’ah</em> without following the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So the differentiation of the way of the people of <em>Hadeeth</em> and narrations [<em>Athar</em>] and the followers of the pious predecessors [<em>Salaf-us-Saalih</em>] is based upon two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>“Following the Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And each from both of these is bound to the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So following the <em>Sunnah</em> is following the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> and following the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> is following the <em>Sunnah</em>; because it has been authentically reported from the Prophet – <em>sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> – the narration which is in the <em>‘Sunan’</em>, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>“And this nation will split into seventy three sects. All of them are in the hell fire except one and that is the Jamaa’ah.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And [speech unclear] sects in the hell fire – meaning – that are promised with entering into the hell fire, and the victorious is only one sect and that is the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>. And they are the followers of the <em>Sunnah</em>, exemplifying the saying of the Prophet – <em>sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>“Upon you is my Sunnah and Sunnah of the rightly guided Caliphs, those who guide to righteousness, after me. Hold on to it and bite upon it with your molars”</strong> – The Hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(Translation source: <a href="http://www.islaam.ae" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.islaam.ae</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>2) Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>Question:</em> Is Salafiyyah a hizb (party) amongst the parties? And is ascribing to them (the Salafis) a blameworthy thing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan:</em> As-Salafiyyah is the Saved Sect and they are Ahl us-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. It is not a hizb (party) from amongst the various parties, those which are called parties today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Rather they are the Jamaa’ah, the Jamaa’ah upon the Sunnah and upon the Deen (Religion). They are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">The Prophet – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – said, “There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah (nation) manifest and upon the truth, not being harmed by those who forsake them neither by those who oppose them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And he – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – also said, “And this Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Hell-Fire except one.” They said, “Which one is this O Messenger of Allaah?” He replied, “They are those who are upon what I and my companions are upon today.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Hence, Salafiyyah is a group of people (the Salafis) upon the madhab of the Salaf, upon what the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And it is not a hizb from amongst the contemporary groups present today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Rather it is the very old Jamaa’ah, from the time of the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – which inherits (this way) and continues, and which never ceases to be upon the manifest truth until the establishment of the Hour, as he (Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam) has informed us.</p>
