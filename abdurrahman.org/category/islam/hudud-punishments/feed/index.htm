Chapter 350<br />
Undesirability of Intercession in Hudud</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>The woman and the man guilty of illegal sexual intercourse, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day.</b></span><b>&#8221; (24:2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1770.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Quraish were anxious about a woman from Banu Makhzum who had committed theft and asked : &#8220;Who will speak to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about her?&#8221; Then they said: &#8220;No one will be bold enough to do so except Usamah bin Zaid, the (Companion who was) dearly loved by the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; So Usamah (May Allah be pleased with him) spoke to him and the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) (angrily) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Are you interceding regarding one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?</span>&#8221; He then got up and delivered an address in which he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Indeed what destroyed the people before you was just that when a person of high rank among them committed a theft, they spared him; but if the same crime was done by a poor person they inflicted the prescribed punishment on him. I swear by Allah that if Fatimah daughter of Muhammad should steal, I would have her hand cut off.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     In another narration `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: (Upon hearing the intercession of Usamah), the face of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) changed color (because of anger) and he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you dare to intercede in matters prescribed by Allah?</span>&#8221; Usamah pleaded: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Pray for my forgiveness.&#8221; `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) added: Thereafter the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) gave orders to have that woman&#8217;s hand cut off.</p>

Chapter 283<br />
Prohibition of Chastisement with Fire</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1609.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent us on an expedition and said to us, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you find so-and-so (he named two persons belonging to the Quraish) commit them to the fire.</span>&#8221; When we were on the verge of departure, he said to us, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I ordered you to burn so-and-so, but it is Allah Alone Who punishes with the fire. So if you find them put them to death</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1610.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a journey when he drew apart (to relieve nature). In his absence, we saw a red bird which had two young ones with it. We caught them and the red mother bird came, beating the earth with its wings. In the meantime the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) returned and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Who has put this bird to distress on account of its young? Return them to her</span>.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) also noticed a mound of ants which we had burnt up. He asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Who has set fire to this?</span>&#8221; We replied: &#8220;We have done so.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">None can chastise with fire except the Rubb of the fire</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 17:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book Pertaining to Punishments Prescribed by Islam (Kitab Al-Hudud) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The penal laws of Islam are called Hudud in the Hadith and Fiqh. This word is the plural of Hadd, which means prevention, hindrance, restraint, prohibition, and hence a restrictive ordinance or statute of God, respecting things lawful and unlawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments are divided into two classes, one of which is called Hadd and the other Ta&#8217;zir. The Hadd is a measure of punishment defined by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In Ta&#8217;zir, the court, is allowed to use its discretion in regard to the form and measure in which such punishment is to be inflicted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments by way of Hadd are of the following forms: death by stoning, amputation of a limb or limbs, flogging by one hundred or eighty strokes. They are prescribed respectively for the following offences: adultery committed by married persons, theft, highway robbery, drunkenness and slander imputing unchastity to women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishments described above are the maximum punishments for the above mentioned crimes. These can be reduced keeping in view the circumstances in which the crimes were committed, the nature of the evidence, and the motive of the criminal with which he committed the crime.</p>

This (injustice) destroyed those before you that when any one of (high) rank committed theft among them, they spared him, and when any weak one among them committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, even if Fatima daughter of Muhammad were to commit theft, I would have cut off her hand. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded about that woman who had committed theft, and her hand was cut off. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) said: Hers was a good respentance, and she later on married and used to come to me after that, and I conveyed her needs (and problems) to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).</p>

The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b. Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the morning, and if she makes a confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went to her in the morning and she made a confession. And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to the Jews and said: What do you find in Torah for one who commits adultery?

He said: Bring Torah if you are truthful. They brought it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salim who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) called them (the Jews) and said: Is this the punishment that you find in your Book (Torah) as a prescribed punishment for adultery? They said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) called one of the scholars amongst them and said: I ask you in the name of Allah Who sent down the Torah on Moses if that is the prescribed punishment for adultery that you find in your Book. He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I would not have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as punishment prescribed in the Torah). But this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us argree (on a punishment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor. So We decided to blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, I am the first to revive Thy command when they had made it dead. He then commanded and he (the offender) was stoned to death. Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, sent down (this verse):&#8221; O Messenger, (the behaviour of) those who vie with one another in denying the truth should not grieve you&#8230;&#8221; up to&#8221; is vouchsafed unto you, accept it&#8221; (v. 41) 2176 It was said (by the Jews): Go to Muhammad; it he commands you to blacken the face and award flogging (as punishment for adultery), then accept it, but it he gives verdict for stoning, then avoid it. It was (then) that Allah, the Majestic and Great, sent down (these verses):&#8221; And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed are, indeed, deniers of the truth&#8221; (v. 44) ;&#8221; And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed-they, they indeed are the wrongdoers&#8221; (v. 45) ;&#8221; And they who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed-they are the iniquitous (v. 47).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubida b. as-Samit reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took (a pledge) from us as he took from the women that we will not associate anything with Allah and we will not steal, and we will not commit adultery, and we will not kill our children, and we will not bring calumny upon one another. And he who amongst you fulfils (this pledge), his reward rests with Allah, and he upon whom amongst you is imposed the prescribed punishment and that is carried out, that is his expiation (for that sin), and he whose (sins) were covered by Allah, his matter rests with Allah. He may punish him if He likes or may forgive him if He so likes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from the tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to the Prophet and  embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go  to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine (as a  medicine). They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy)  they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took  the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught  and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and  that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and  legs should not be cauterized, till they die. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 795: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet cut off the hands and feet of the men belonging  to the tribe of &#8216;Uraina and did not cauterise (their bleeding limbs) till they died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 796: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (tribe) came to the Prophet and  they were living with the people of As-Suffa, but they became ill as the climate of Medina  did not suit them, so they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Provide us with milk.&#8221; The  Prophet said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;  So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy  and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought  before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their  eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized.  Then they were put at a place called Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they  were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Those people committed theft and  murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 797: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (or &#8216;Uraina) tribe &#8212;-but I  think he said that they were from &#8216;Ukl came to Medina and (they became ill, so) the  Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) she-camels and told them to go out and  drink the camels&#8217; urine and milk (as a medicine). So they went and drank it, and when they  became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This news reached the  Prophet early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they were  captured and brought to the Prophet before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and  legs and their eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at  Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba  said, &#8220;Those were the people who committed theft and murder and reverted to disbelief  after being believers (Muslims), and fought against Allah and His Apostle&#8221;). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 798: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Seven (people) will be shaded by  Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when there will be no shade except His  Shade. (They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of  Allah, a man who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a  man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in  the mosque), two men who love each other for Allah&#8217;s Sake, a man who is called by a  charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says,  &#8216;I am afraid of Allah,&#8217; and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his  left hand does not know what his right hand has given.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever guarantees me (the chastity  of) what is between his legs (i.e. his private parts), and what is between his jaws (i.e.,  his tongue), I guarantee him Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 800i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will narrate to you a narration which nobody will narrate  to you after me. I heard that form the Prophet. I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;The Hour  sill not be established&#8221; or said: &#8220;From among the portents of the Hour is that  the religious knowledge will betaken away (by the death of religious Scholars) and general  ignorance (of religion) will appear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very  common, and (open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decrease in  number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty women there will only be one  man to look after them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ikrima from Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostles said, &#8220;When a slave (of Allah)  commits illegal sexual intercourse, he is not a believer at the time of committing it; and  if he steals, he is not a believer at the time of stealing; and if he drinks an alcoholic  drink, when he is not a believer at the time of drinking it; and he is not a believer when  he commits a murder,&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said: I asked Ibn Abbas, &#8220;How is faith taken away  from him?&#8221; He said, Like this,&#8221; by clasping his hands and then separating them,  and added, &#8220;But if he repents, faith returns to him like this, by clasping his hands  again. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who commits an illegal  sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse  and a thief is not a believer at the time of committing theft and a drinker of alcoholic  drink is not a believer at the time of drinking. Yet, (the gate of) repentance is open  thereafter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Which is the biggest  sin?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To set up rivals to Allah by worshipping others though He alone  has created you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your  child lest it should share your food.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew and a Jewess were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a  charge of committing an illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet asked them. &#8220;What is  the legal punishment (for this sin) in your Book (Torah)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Our  priests have innovated the punishment of blackening the faces with charcoal and  Tajbiya.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, tell them to bring the  Torah.&#8221; The Torah was brought, and then one of the Jews put his hand over the Divine  Verse of the Rajam (stoning to death) and started reading what preceded and what followed  it. On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Behold! The Divine  Verse of the Rajam was under his hand. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that the two (sinners)  be stoned to death, and so they were stoned.

(The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdur  Rahman added: I do not know what kind of food it was). On that the Prophet said,  &#8220;Where is the burnt person?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; The Prophet  said to him, &#8220;Take this (food) and give it in charity (to someone).&#8221; The man  said, &#8220;To a poorer person than l? My family has nothing to eat.&#8221; Then the  Prophet said to him, &#8220;Then eat it yourselves.&#8221; </font></p>

The man came to that side to which the Prophet had turned his face, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have committed an illegal intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet  turned his face to the other side, and the man came to that side, and when he confessed  four times, the Prophet called him and said, &#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes,  O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said (to the people), &#8220;Take him away and stone  him to death.&#8221; Ibn Shihab added, &#8220;I was told by one who heard Jabir, that Jabir  said, &#8216;I was among those who stoned the man, and we stoned him at the Musalla (&#8216;Id praying  Place), and when the stones troubled him, he jumped quickly and ran away, but we overtook  him at Al-Harra and stoned him to death (there).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

Then I asked a learned  man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and  be exiled for one year, and the man&#8217;s wife should be stoned to death.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of  Allah. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to  receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 817: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to teach (the Qur&#8217;an to) some people of the  Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Auf. While I was in his  house at Mina, and he was with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &#8216;Umar&#8217;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman  came to me and said, &#8220;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of  the Believers (&#8216;Umar), saying, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about  so-and-so who says, &#8216;If &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to  such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a  prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&#8217; &#8216;Umar became angry and then said,  &#8216;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people  who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Chief of the  believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble,  and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I  am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your  statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning,  and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the  place of emigration and the place of Prophet&#8217;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch  with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the  learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&#8217; On that,  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver  before the people in Medina.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month  of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun  had declined, and I saw Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the  pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a  short while &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to  Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail &#8220;Today &#8216;Umar will say such a thing as he has never  said since he was chosen as Caliph.&#8221; Said denied my statement with astonishment and  said, &#8220;What thing do you expect &#8216;Umar to say the like of which he has never said  before?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the meantime, &#8216;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the  callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &#8216;Umar stood up, and having glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then, I am going to tell you  something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my  death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his  mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is  unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed  the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the  stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and  we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did carry out  the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody  will say, &#8216;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&#8217;s Book,&#8217; and thus they  will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of  the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits  illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception  or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&#8217;s Book: &#8216;O people! Do  not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief  (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real  father.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry  was praised, but call me Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostles.&#8217; (O people!) I have been informed  that a speaker amongst you says, &#8216;By Allah, if &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of  allegiance to such-and-such person.&#8217; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the  pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt,  it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you  who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to  anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the  person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both  should be killed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were  informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da. &#8216;Ali and  Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr.  I said to Abu Bakr, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; So we set out seeking  them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the  final decision of the Ansar, and said, &#8216;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you  going?&#8217; We replied, &#8216;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; They said to us, &#8216;You  shouldn&#8217;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, we  will go to them.&#8217; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da.  Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &#8216;Who is  that man?&#8217; They said, &#8216;He is Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is wrong with him?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;He is sick.&#8217; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&#8217;s speaker said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8217; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &#8216;To  proceed, we are Allah&#8217;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you,  the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of  preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had  prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr,  and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Wait a  while.&#8217; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser  and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own  prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause  he said, &#8216;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves,  but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs  as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these  two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr  held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&#8217;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing  of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck  chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members  is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&#8217;t feel at  present.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And then one of the Ansar said, &#8216;I am the pillar on which  the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a  noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us  and one from you.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their  voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &#8216;O Abu  Bakr! Hold your hand out.&#8217; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then  all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we  became victorious over Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the  Ansar said, &#8216;You have killed Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah has killed Sa&#8217;d bin  Ubada.&#8217; Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us  (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged  to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge  of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our  consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great  trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted  allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Decide his case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. My son was a laborer working  for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people  told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave  girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that  my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah&#8217;s  Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais!

One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before  and after it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Where he  lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, &#8220;O Muhammad! He has  said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death,  and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her  from the stones. </font></p>

Verily, I have more sense of  ghira than Sa&#8217;d, and Allah has more sense of ghira than I.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed the case of Lian (the case of a man who charged  his wife for committing illegal sexual intercourse when I was fifteen years old. The  Prophet ordered that they be divorced, and the husband said, &#8220;If I kept her, I would  be a liar.&#8221; I remember that Az-Zubair also said, &#8220;(It was said) that if that  woman brought forth the child with such-and-such description, her husband would prove  truthful, but if she brought it with such-and-such description looking like a Wahra (a red  insect), he would prove untruthful.&#8221; I heard Az-Zubair also saying, &#8220;Finally she  gave birth to a child of description which her husband disliked . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Lian was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet, Asim bin  Adi said a statement about it, and when he left, a man from his tribe came to him  complaining that he had seen a man with his wife. Asim said, &#8220;I have been put to  trial only because of my statement.&#8221; So he took the man to the Prophet and the man  told him about the incident. The man (husband) was of yellow complexion, thin, and of lank  hair, while the man whom he had accused of having been with his wife, was reddish brown  with fat thick legs and fat body. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&#8221;  Later on the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom the husband had accused of  having been with her. So the Prophet made them take the oath of Lian. A man said to Ibn  Abbas in the gathering, &#8220;Was that the same lady about whom the Prophet said, &#8220;If  I were to stone any lady (for committing illegal sexual intercourse) to death without  witnesses, I would have stoned that lade to death?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;No, that  was another lady who used to behave in such a suspicious way among the Muslims that one  might accuse her of committing illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

What are they?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to practice sorcery; to kill the life  which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law); to eat up  usury (Riba), to eat up the property of an orphan; to give one&#8217;s back to the enemy and  freeing from the battle-field at the time of fighting and to accuse chaste women who never  even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I beseech you to  judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then his opponent who was wiser than he, got up  and said, &#8220;He has spoken the truth. So judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and please  allow me (to speak), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom  (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they  informed me that my son should be flogged one-hundred stripes, and be exiled for one year,  and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death).&#8221;The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The  one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais!

The nations before you went astray because if a noble person committed theft, they used to leave him, but if a weak person among them committed theft, they used to inflict the legal punishment on him.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibbaan (7491) narrated that Aboo Umaamah al-Baahili (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;" align="center">I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: Climb up.’ I said: I cannot do it.’ They said: We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: What are these voices?’ They said: This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: Who are these?’ They said: <strong>These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so</strong>.’</div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Classed as <em>Saheeh</em> by <strong>al-Albaanee</strong> in <em>Saheeh Mawaarid adh-Dham-aan</em>, 1509].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Albaanee (may Allaah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then <strong>deliberately</strong> broke his fast before the time for <em>iftaar</em> had come.<strong> So how about one who does not fast at all?</strong> We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
