<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Introduction to the English Edition</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May His peace and prayers be upon Muhammad and upon those who follow his Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than likely this book shall attract much attention. Perhaps it shall be a gift from a husband to his wife or perhaps those of us awaiting marriage will eagerly study these few pages to better understand what is expected of us and how we can strive towards it. Nevertheless there will be some who shall huff and utter annoyances under their breath claiming that yet again this is targeted at women (not men), censuring and restricting them. Unfortunately such people will rarely study the text but on flicking through these pages shall come to the conclusion that this has been written by a fanatical male Muslim to tyrannise and discredit the role of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In six short, concise chapters Muhammad Shūmān has brought together a collection of authentic ahaadeeth and many <em>Aayaat</em> to aid the Muslimah towards righteousness and advise and encourage her with regards to her husbands rights upon her and how she can attain the pleasure of her Creator by doing so. You may find some of the wording harsh, or even strange, but the fault isn&#8217;t in the text, rather in ourselves due to this society where the &#8216;choices&#8217; are only the western liberal choices and hence we have become accustomed to moulding ourselves in a particular way &#8211; sometimes quite alien from Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our duty above all is to worship Allaah, obedience to Him taking precedence over the rest of creation. If He asks us to do something then that should become an aim we try our hardest to fulfill. With this in mind, when we now approach the issue of marriage then it should be made clear that obedience to one&#8217;s husband is an Islamic duty and hence earns the pleasure of our Lord. It must be pointed out that the author has kept his own words to a minimum and instead has based this book on the Sayings of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (with the explanation of some prominent scholars) &#8211; thus the Believer has no choice but to submit to it wholeheartedly. Allaah, the Most High says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not fitting for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> (Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we read this and digest it with a sincere heart and recognise that there isn&#8217;t hardship imposed on the woman and ease for the man, rather that which is mentioned shall only lead to greater comfort, ease and satisfaction for both parties. A marriage which starts on the right footing where the husband and wife identify their own roles and compliment each other according to what is contained in the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah then theirs shall be the marriage in which there is happiness and joy &#8211; success in both worlds, for they have put their entire trust in Allaah, He who knows what benefits and rectifies the servants and what harms and corrupts them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the pages are few, the lessons are many and even if we were to act on half of them we would feel an immediate change in ourselves and our homes. It is about time that a book of this nature and dealing with such an important topic has become available to the Muslim women in the west where we are in much need of instruction from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah so that we can easily reject western models and replace them with the best of examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this book will not be misused by husbands but rather that it will serve as a reminder to them also and a warning that they are not left to their customary conduct in this affair. There is advise and encouragement for the husband to live with his wife in a good and honourable manner, taking care of her &#8211; highlighting that the success and tranquility of the marriage does not just fall upon his wife, rather it is a shared responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to reward the author for this service and his efforts, and may all the Muslim women who read this try to mould their characteristics upon this noble way and may all the Muslim men help and encourage us towards attaining the rewards and excellence for being a righteous wife.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author&#8217;s Foreword</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, there is no one who can misguide him; and whosoever Allaah misguides, there is no one who can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, who has no partner; and I testify that Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise, &#8220;<strong>The Righteous Wife</strong>&#8221; is concise in its wording, important in its subject and valuable for the points of benefit it contains. We ask Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, to make this treatise of benefit to our Muslim sisters, and to all those who read it, and that He makes it a work done purely and sincerely to seek His Face. Indeed He is the one who gives bounteously and generously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by<br />
Muhammad Shūmān<br />
1st Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1410H.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Seriousness of the Rights of the Husband</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The men have authority over the women due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman, and due to the wealth that they spend upon them.&#8221;</span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer </strong></span>says, &#8220;The man is in charge (<em>qayyim</em>) of the woman, i.e. he is the one in-charge of her, her chief, the one having authority over her and the one who corrects her if she inclines away from what is correct.&#8221; [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa&#8217; dee </span></strong>said (regarding the above mentioned <em>Aayah</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is due to the excellence of men over women, and the eminence which they have been given over them. So the pre-eminence of the men over the women is from many aspects: holding positions of leadership and authority is particular to men, likewise Prophethood and Messengership. They are also particularised by many acts of worship such as <em>jihaad</em> , the <em>eids</em> and the <em>Jum&#8217;ah</em> prayers. Also due to the characteristics given to them by Allaah, the like of which are not possessed by women such as sound intellect, composure, patience and endurance. Likewise they are particularised with having to spend upon their wives, and indeed spending in many ways which are particular to the men &#8211; which distinguish them from the women. So perhaps this is the reason for His saying:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong><strong>وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا</strong> </span> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;due to the wealth that they spend&#8230;</span>&#8221; &#8211; and exactly what they spend is not stated to indicate that the spending referred to is general. So from all this it is known that the man is like a governor and master for his wife, and she is with him like a captive. So his role is to take care of that which Allaah has placed him in-charge of, and her role is to be obedient to her Lord and to obey her husband.&#8221; [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Qaasimee</span></strong> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8221; <strong>الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ &#8221; </strong></span>&#8216;The men have authority (<em>qawwaamoon</em>) over the women&#8217; [04] &#8211; <em>qawwaamoon</em> is the plural of <em>qawwaam</em>. <em>Qawwaam</em> is the one who is responsible for taking care of their welfare, managing their affairs and disciplining them. That is, they are in-charge of and are to take care of the manners and behaviour of the women; ordering them and forbidding them, just as the ruler is responsible for his subjects. This is due to two reasons: (i) Due to the nature which Allaah gave them, and (ii) due to the role which they carry out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is indicated by the Saying of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"> بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman.&#8221;</span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the relation between the men and women, and means that the men have a position of dominance over them due to the superiority which Allaah has given to the men over the women.&#8221; [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Men have a degree over the women.&#8221;</span> [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> </span>said, &#8220;Meaning: in excellence; in the nature given to them; in manners; in status; in the obedience due to them; in their spending and taking care of the (women&#8217;s) welfare; and in excellence in this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Every soul from the children of Aadam is a master; so the man is the master of his family, and the woman is the mistress of her household</em>.</span> &#8221; [09]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If I were to order anyone to prostrate to other than Allaah, I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband. By Him in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the woman will not fulfill the rights of her Lord until she fulfills the rights of her husband; and even if he were to request her for herself (i.e. to have intercourse with her) whilst she was sitting upon a camel&#8217;s saddle </em></span>[10]<span style="color:#808000;"><em>, she should not refuse him.&#8221; </em></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not right that any human being should prostrate to another human being, and if it were right for a human being to prostrate to another human being I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband due to the greatness of his right upon her. By Him in whose Hand is my soul, if from his foot to the crown of his head there was a wound pouring forth pus, and she (the wife) came and licked that, then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right. &#8220;</span></em> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;The right of the husband over the wife is such that if he had a wound, or his nostrils were pouring forth pus or blood, then she were to swallow that down &#8211; then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right.&#8221;</em></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;It is not right for a woman to fast </em></span>[14]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> whilst the husband is present except with his permission; </em></span>[15]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and whatever wealth she spends in charity without his order, then half of the reward is for him. &#8221; </em></span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh al-Albaanee </span></strong>said<strong><span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong> &#8220;Since it is an obligation upon the woman to obey her husband with regard to fulfillment of his desire with her, then it is even more fitting that it is obligatory upon her to obey him with regard to that which is even more important than that &#8211; such as what pertains to bringing up the children, correcting her family and the like &#8211; all such rights and obligations.&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr </strong></span>said, &#8220;The hadeeth shows that the right of the husband upon the wife has priority over her performing optional good deeds, since his right is an obligation, and fulfillment of an obligation takes precedence over carrying out something optional.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</span></strong>, <em>rahimahullaah</em>, was asked about a man who has a wife who fasts during the day and stands in prayer throughout the nights. Whenever he calls her to his bed she refuses and gives precedence to praying in the night and fasting during the day over obedience to the husband. So is this permissible? Shaykhul-Islaam replied, &#8220;That is not permissible for her by agreement of the Muslims. Rather it is obligatory upon her to obey when he calls her to the bed, this is a binding obligation upon her. However standing the night in prayer and fasting during the day is optional, so how can a believing woman give precedence to something optional over an obligation&#8230; and there is no right, after the rights of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) more binding upon the woman than the rights of the husband.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If the woman knew the right of the husband, she would not sit when his morning and evening meals were presented until he finished. &#8220;</span></em> [20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Encouragement of Obedience to the Husband and Seeking to Please Him</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fast her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.'&#8221;</span></em> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Your women from the people of Paradise are the beloved and fertile, the one who is an asset to her husband, who if her husband becomes angry- comes and places her hand in the hand of her husband and says, &#8216;I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me). &#8220;&#8216;</em></span> [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Warning Against Causing the Husband to Become Angry, Disobeying His Orders and Neglecting His Rights</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fadaalah ibn &#8216;Ubayd, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;There are three who are not to be asked about: </em></span>[23]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> A man who abandon s the Jamaa&#8217;ah </em></span>[24] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and disobeys his ruler </em></span>[25]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and dies in a state of disobedience &#8211; so do not ask about him; a female slave or a male slave who flees from his master; and a woman whose husband is away, and he has provided for her worldly needs, yet she adorns and displays herself </em></span>[26] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and roams around freely</em></span> [27] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>without him &#8211; so do not ask about them. &#8221; </em></span>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;There are three whose prayers will not be raised above their ears: the runaway slave until he returns; a woman who spends the night whilst her husband is angry with her; </span></em>[29]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> and one who leads a people in prayer and they dislike him.</span></em>[30] [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not Look at a woman who does not give thanks to her husband and she cannot do without him. &#8220;</span></em> [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses him except that the One who is in the heaven is angry with her until he (her husband) is pleased with her. &#8220;</span></em> [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;When a woman spends the night forsaking the bed of her husband, then the angels curse her until she returns. &#8220;</span></em> [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he spends the night angry with her, then the angels curse her until morning. &#8220;</em></span> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said to a woman, <em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire.&#8221; </span></em>[36] Meaning her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever woman obeys Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to her husband and fulfills his rights, then he will be her Paradise &#8211; meaning he will be a cause for her entering Paradise; and if she is disobedient to her husband &#8211; then the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman does not harm her husband in this world except that his wife from the large eyed hooris (al-Hoorul &#8216;Een) </span></em>[37]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> says, &#8216;Do not harm him, may Allaah kill you,for he is just a passing guest with you and is about to leave you and come to us.&#8217; &#8220;</span></em>[38]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of a Righteous Wife</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;All of this world is a utility and the best utility is a righteous wife. &#8220;</span></em> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d ibn Abee Waqqaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Four things are from prosperity: a righteous woman, a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbour and an agreeable riding beast; and four things are from adversity: an evil neighbour, an evil woman, a bad riding beast and a cramped dwelling. &#8220;</span> </em>[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, nararted, &#8220;When revelation was sent down concerning silver and gold, [41] they said, &#8216;So which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I shall find this out for you.&#8217; So he hastened upon his camel and went to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and I followed him. So he said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;<em>Let one of you possess a heart which is thankful, a tongue which makes mention of(Allaah), and a believing wife who helps one of you upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</em>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous wife is the one whom the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) advised should be obtained right from the beginning. As Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrated from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman is married for four reasons: for her wealth; for her lineage; for her beauty; and for her religion (Deen). So marry the one who is good in her religion (Deen) &#8211; may your hands be covered in dust.&#8221;</span></em> [43]  [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said</span></strong>, &#8220;The meaning is that what is fitting for a person upon the religion and of good manners is that the religion should be the aim which he gives importance to in all of his affairs &#8211; particularly those affairs which he will be involved in for a long period of time. So the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) commanded him to obtain a woman who is good in her practice of the religion &#8211; which is the goal that is desired.&#8221; [45]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Attributes of the Righteous Wife</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">1. Devotion and obedience to Allaah, the Most High</span></strong>, such that she fulfills His rights, such as the prayer, fasting, chastity, covering herself, withholding her gaze and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2. Obedience to her husband</span></strong> in that which does not involve disobedience to Allaah, the Most High, such that she fulfills his rights completely, and fro m them are what has proceeded in the first chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3. That she guards and preserves herself and her honour, in the absence of her husband</span></strong>, from the hand of anyone wishing to touch her, the eye of anyone wishing to look upon her, and the ear of anyone wishing to listen to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise that she preserves her husband&#8217;s children, home and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;dee said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to Allaah, the Most High; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to their husbands even when the husbands are absent, she guards herself and her husband&#8217;s property.&#8221; [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Serving her husband.</span> </strong>First of all by carrying out what is required in his house, such as bringing up and educating the children, preparing the meals and the beds and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Husayn ibn Mihsan who said that my paternal aunt said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) for some need, so he asked, &#8216;You there! Are you married?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He then asked, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;How are you towards your husband?&#8217;</span> She responded, &#8216;I do not fall short in his service except with regard to what I am unable to do. &#8216; He said, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;Then look to your standing with him, for indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire .&#8221;&#8216;</span> </em>[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of how Asmaa&#8217; bint Abee Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</em>, served her husband. She said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Az-Zubayr married me and he did not have any property or slaves or anything upon the earth except for a camel which drew water from the well and his horse. So I used to feed his horse, draw the water, stitch his water bucket, and prepare the dough, but I was not proficient in baking bread &#8211; so ladies from the Ansaar who were my neighbours and were honourable used to bake the bread for me. I also used to carry the date-stones upon my head, from the land given to az-Zubayr by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) &#8211; and it was about two miles away. One day when I was coming with the date-stones on my head, I met Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and a group of the Ansaar were with him. So he called me and said, &#8216;Ikh, ikh.&#8217; [50] in order to carry me behind him upon the camel. But I felt shy to proceed along with the men, and I thought of az-Zubayr and his sense of jealousy, and he was one of the most jealous of the people. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saw my shyness and so passed on. So I came to az-Zubayr and said, &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) met me while I was carrying the date stones upon my head and with him were a group of his Companions. He caused his riding camel to kneel, but I felt shy and remembered your sense of jealousy.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;By Allaah your having to carry the date-stones is harder upon me than that you should ride along with him.&#8221;&#8216; She said, &#8220;Then later on Aboo Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse, so it was as if he had set me free.&#8221; [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differ with regard to the ruling about a woman serving her husband. Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said, &#8220;The scholars differed about whether she has to serve her husband with regard to the like of household bedding, preparing food and drinks, baking the bread, grinding the corn, and providing food for his slaves and cattle &#8211; such as providing fodder for his riding beast and so on. &#8220;Some of them say: It is not obligatory for her to serve him &#8211; and this is a weak saying, like the weakness of the saying that it is not obligatory upon her to live together with him and have intercourse with him! However what is correct is that it is obligatory to serve him, since the husband is her master according to the Book of Allaah, and she is a captive with him according to the Sunnah of the Prophet [52] (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and the captive and the slave have to serve &#8211; and this is something known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the Saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This <em>Aayah</em> shows that it is obligatory upon her to serve her husband unrestrictedly, including: serving him, travelling along with him , making herself available to him, and so on &#8211; just as it is obligatory to obey the parents, since the obedience due from her to the parents transfers to the husband.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">5. Keeping the husbands secrets.</span></strong> Particularly what occurs between him and her in private &#8211; with regard to sexual matters and the private affairs within the marriage. Disclosing the husbands secrets will hurt him and anger him and this contradicts obedience to him and seeking to please him. Furthermore preserving his secrets is one of the duties of the righteous and obedient women, as described in the Saying of Allaah,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Guarding that which (Allaah has commanded them to guard) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of their guarding what they are to guard in the absence of their husbands is that they should not broadcast their secrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa&#8217; bint Yazeed, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhaa</em>, who said that she was in the company of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and men and women were sitting, and he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Perhaps a man mentions that which he did with his wife, and perhaps a woman informs of what she does with her husband?!&#8221; So the people were silent, so I said, &#8220;Yes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah! The women certainly do that, and the men certainly do that.&#8221; He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;Then do not do so, since that is just like a male devil meeting a female devil upon the way, and he has intercourse with her while the people are watching. &#8220;</em></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">6. She should appear before the husband in the best appearance</span></strong>, such that if he looks at her it pleases him. Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrates the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Which of the women is the best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The one who gives him </span></em>[57]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> pleasure when he looks;</span></em>[58]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> obeys him when he orders; and does not go against his wishes with regard to herself or her wealth by doing that which he dislikes. &#8220;</span></em> [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">7. She should not spend any of his wealth or her wealth except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216; Aas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8221; It is not permissible for a woman to give a gift except with the permission of her husband. &#8220;</span> </em>[60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> said, &#8220;However it is not becoming for the husband &#8211; if he is a sincere Muslim &#8211; that he should use this ruling to play the tyrant with his wife and to prevent her from utilizing her wealth in a manner which will not harm either of them. Indeed this right is very similar to the right of the girls guardian &#8211; who is such that she cannot get herself married except with his permission. But if he unjustly prevents her, then the matter is raised to the Islamic judge for justice to be attained. Likewise is the ruling with regard to a woman&#8217;s wealth if her husband oppresses her and prevents her from spending her wealth in a lawful and prescribed manner &#8211; then the judge will also bring about justice for her. So there is no problem with the ruling itself, rather the problem is in how it is misused.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">8. She should not permit anyone to enter her husbands house except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission; nor may she permit anyone to enter his house except with his permission; and whatever she spends in charity without his order &#8211; then half of the reward is for him. &#8220;</span></em> [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>9. She should not ask her husband for divorce without a reason necessitating that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman asks her husband for divorce without a strong reason &#8211; then the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden for her. &#8220;</span></em> [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">10. Avoidance of cursing.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em> &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) went out to the prayer-ground for the (prayer of) Adhaa or Fitr, and he passed by the women and said, &#8216;O women! Give in charity,for I have been shown that you shall be the majority of the people of the Fire .&#8217; So they asked, &#8216;Why is that, 0 Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. &#8216;&#8221;</em> </span>[64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">11. Being thankful to the husband for the good he does and for his good treatment of his wife.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is accomplished by good words, and by her obedience to him in what is good, and by not forgetting his good treatment and avoiding denying this, since that is one of the reasons which brings about entry into the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;I was shown the Fire and found that the majority of its inhabitants were women, due to ingratitude. It was said: &#8220;Is it that they disbelieve in Allaah?&#8221; He said: They are ungrateful to their husbands and deny the good they do. If you were to treat one of them well always, and she then saw something (displeasing) from you she would say: &#8216;I have never seen any good from you. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not look at a woman who is not thankful to her husband and she cannot do without him.&#8221;</span></em> [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">12. She should not remove her clothes outside her husbands house.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman removes her clothes in other than her house, then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her. &#8220;</span> </em>[67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Manaawee said</strong>, &#8216;&#8221;Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her&#8217; since because she has failed to take care of what she has been commanded with regard to covering herself from strangers, then this is the recompense she receives, the recompense being of the type of the action. What is apparent is that removal of her clothing means uncovering herself to strange males, for the purpose of sexual intercourse or that which leads to it. As opposed to the case if she were to remove her clothes amongst women, whilst covering her private parts, since there is no reason for that to enter into this warning.&#8221; [68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">13. Striving to please the husband by every possible means.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth has already preceded containing the saying of the righteous wife, &#8220;<strong>&#8230; I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me)</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in <em>al-Kabaa&#8217;ir</em> of adh-Dhahabee, &#8220;What is obligatory upon the woman is that she seeks the pleasure of her husband, and avoids angering him, and does not refuse him whenever he wants her. The woman must also know that she is like a slave to her husband, so she should not do anything affecting herself or her husbands wealth except with his permission. She should give precedence to his rights over her rights, and the rights of his relatives over the rights of her relatives, and she should keep herself clean and be ready for him to enjoy her. She should not boast at his expense of her beauty, nor rebuke him for any ugliness found in him. The woman must also be always modest and reserved in the presence of her husband, lower her eyes in front of him, obey his commands, remain silent when he speaks, keep far away from everything which angers him, avoid treachery when he is absent, with regard to his bed, his wealth and his house. She should ensure that her aroma is pleasant, be accustomed to using musk and perfume and cleaning her mouth with siwaak. She should be constant in adorning herself in his presence and not when he is absent. She should treat his family and relatives honourably, and consider something small from him as something great.&#8221; [69]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Means to Help the Wife to Attain These Attributes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the greatness and exaltedness of Allaah, the Most High, and that He is the True God, the One who watches over His creation, and that His Religion is the true and straight way, and the laws He had prescribed are the straight path, and to know the perfectness of His Wisdom in whatever He orders and forbids, and whatever He decrees and chooses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore that His knowledge comprehends everything to be known, what is apparent and what is hidden: so He knows what benefits the servants and what harms them. He knows what will rectify them and what will ruin and corrupt them. He, the One free of all imperfections, is also the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy, so He does not order His servants except with that which is good for them in their Religion and their worldly-life, and brings about felicity for them in this world and the Hereafter; and He does not forbid them except from that which will bring misery for them in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whatever He, the One free of all imperfections, has prescribed is a mercy and a blessing; and whoever proceeds upon that way and follows it will be one of those who are happy and successful in both worlds, and will live a fine life filled with happiness and joy, they will not be miserable at all except in those things where they contradict the commandments of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً ۖ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female, and is a true-Believer, we will give him a good life (by granting him contentment) and we will reward them in the Hereafter in accordance with the best of what they used to do.&#8221;</span> [70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever turns away from my reminder, then there is for him a life of hardship and wretchedness.&#8221;</span> [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the wife is aware of the greatness of Allaah, the Most High, and His perfect wisdom, and His all-encompassing knowledge, and His extensive mercy, then she will strive to obey Him, the Majestic and Most High, and to be obedient to her husband as He has commanded her. She will hasten to fulfill his rights without hesitation or laziness, and she will not say: &#8216;why is it the case that the man is in authority over me?!&#8217; &#8216;why do I have to obey him?!&#8217; &#8216;why &#8230; why?!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> [72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So no, by your Lord, they cannot be Believers until they make you, 0 Muhammad, judge in all disputes between them, then they do not find any opposition in themselves against your judgements, and they accept them with full submission.&#8221;</span> [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the means which will help her to attain the attribute of the righteous women is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Desire for that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has prepared for the righteous women in Paradise </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comprehensive good and the huge reward which is such as has been seen by no eye, heard by no ear, nor imagined by any human heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• Fear of the retribution and Anger of Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear of all that He has prepared for the disobedient in the Hereafter with regard to punishment, disgrace, and severe and painful torment, may Allaah save us from that, by His grace and favour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also already brought two chapters: one in encouragement of looking after the rights of the husband, and the other warning against neglecting his rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Seeking the Aid of Allaah, the Most High</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the attainment of the smallest good is not possible unless Allaah, the Most High, guides and sets one straight. Concerning this Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of  <strong>بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ </strong> is:&#8217;by Allaah&#8217;s guarding and protecting them when they become like that.&#8217; This is what at-Tabaree [75] and a group of the scholars of tafseer said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the greatest aids to a wife&#8217;s righteousness is:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• That she keeps company with righteous and pious women, that she listens to them, and seeks to be like them; and that she avoids the company of corrupt women, and avoids sitting with them and listening to them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed she should beware of observing their making a display of themselves, and showing their nakedness, and their evil manners, whether this is seen by means of television, video or whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;The example of the righteous companion and the evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and the blacksmiths bellows. From the musk seller you will either buy some musk or at least enjoy its good smell. But the bellows of the blacksmith will either burn your house or your clothes, or at least you will receive a bad smell from it. &#8220;</span></em> [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An-Nawawee</strong> <strong>said</strong></span>, &#8220;It shows the excellence of sitting with the righteous, and the people of good, and those possessing good character and fine manners and piety, and the people of knowledge and refinement; and the forbiddence of sitting with the people of evil, and the people of innovation, and those who backbite the people, or those who are commonly involved in shamelessness and idleness, and such reprehensible folk.&#8221; [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ar-Raaghib said</span></strong>, &#8220;This hadeeth indicates that it is a duty upon a person to strive to the utmost of his ability to accompany and sit with good people, since this may cause a bad person to become a person of good, just as accompanying evil people may turn a person from good to bad. So just as it is seen that water and air can be corrupted by being next to a rotting corpse, then what do you think will be the effect upon human souls which are such that they accept and take on the good and the evil which they see?!&#8221; [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from that which will make it easier for a woman to attain the attributes of the righteous women: is that she should choose a righteous husband, and the woman should straight away reject any proposal of marriage unless they come from a person who is good in his practice of the Religion and his manners, who is such that he will assist her upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If there comes to you </span></em>[79] <em><span style="color:#808000;">one </span></em>[80]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> whose character and Religion are pleasing to you, then marry (her) to him; if you do not do so it will result in tribulation upon the earth and widespread corruption.&#8221; </span></em>[81]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Epilogue</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is the case that the woman is commanded to be obedient to her husband, and to seek to please him, and to take care of his rights, then it is also the case that the husband is commanded to treat her well, and with kindness, and to have patience with any bad characteristics and the like that may be seen from her. He must give her rights of provision and clothing, and that he lives with her in a good and honourable manner, as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And live with them in a good manner.&#8221;</span> [82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Take care of the women.</em></span>&#8221; [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#808000;">The most complete of the Believers are the best of them in manners, and the best of them are those who are best to their women</span></em>.&#8221; [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Iyaas ibn &#8216; Abdullaah ibn Abee Dhubaab, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> , who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8221;Do not beat the female servants of Allaah. So &#8216;Umar came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The women have become emboldened towards their husbands. </em></span>[85]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> So he gave permission to strike them, so they were struck. Then many women came to the wives of Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (complaining about their husbands), so in the morning he said: Seventy women have this night visited the family of Muhammad, each of them complaining about her husband. So you will not find those </em></span>[86] [87]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> men to be the best amongst you.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This concludes what we wished to draw attention to in this brief treatise, which, if Allaah wills, will be beneficial. &#8220;How free and far removed from all imperfections You are, O Allaah, and all praise is for You. I declare You free of all defects and praise You alone. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn in repentance to You.&#8221; [88]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">AI-Haakim said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of Muslim&#8221; and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and al-Albaanee agreed in Silsilatul-Ahaadeethis-Saheehah (no.8 1).</p>

<p><em><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. After Ishmael’s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael’s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael’s wife about him, she replied, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, ‘We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,’ complaining to him.</strong></span> He said, ‘When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).’ When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, ‘Has anyone visited you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.’ On that Ishmael said, ‘Did he advise you anything?’ She replied, ‘Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.’ Ishmael said, ‘It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.’ So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael’s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Abraham asked her, ‘How are you getting on?’ asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, ‘We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).’ Then she thanked Allah’</strong></span> Abraham said, ‘What kind of food do you eat?’ She said. ‘Meat.’ He said, ‘What do you drink?’ She said, ‘Water.” He said, “O Allah! Bless their meat and water.” The Prophet added, “At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.” The Prophet added, “If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.” The Prophet added,” Then Abraham said Ishmael’s wife, “When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.’ When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, ‘Did anyone call on you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,’ so she praised him and added. ‘He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.’ Ishmael asked her, ‘Did he give you any piece of advice?’ She said, ‘Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.’ On that Ishmael said, ‘It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.’ [<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2009/07/23/the-mother-of-ishmael/">https://abdurrahman.org/2009/07/23/the-mother-of-ishmael/</a>]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of Judgment. O Allah! Have Your <em>Salat</em> (1) and <em>Salam</em> (peace) and blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and upon all of his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extraordinary consideration has been given by the Islamic Law to women&#8217;s affairs, all meant to protect her chastity, to honor her and to secure her position in life. The so called &#8220;restrictions&#8221; placed upon her regarding her dress and the display of her beauty and ornament is only to guard against all ways of corruption arising from such dazzling displays. What Islam has established is not a restriction on the freedom of women but is a firm protection for her from falling down to the lowest levels of humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the means of this protection is the HIJAB. The characteristics of the Hijab are discussed, bringing the glad tidings promised (by Allah) to those women adhering to it. We also point out the danger of dazzling displays of ornaments and beauty as well as the terrible repercussions in this life and in the hereafter for those who practice <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj </em>(display of beauty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It comes at a time when more women are throwing away their revealing clothes, and wearing the Hijab. This comes at a time when Muslim women wearing Hijab are attacked in &#8220;civilized&#8221; Europe (2)! and inFrance (3) Muslim women are prevented from wearing the head scarf / Hijab at school. These are times of trials for Muslims and particularly for Muslim women. We all have to remember the path of the Prophets: endurance, patience, holding on, and aiming high by keeping the way of Allah above everything.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"> (1) The <em>Salat</em> of Allah upon prophet Muhammad is His Praise and mentioning of the Prophet to the angels in the Most High place in Paradise</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(2) Bosnia is a testimony against the &#8220;civility&#8221; of Europe and the West. Civility stops at the word: Muslim or Islam!</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(3) The country that raises the banner of: equality, brotherhood, and freedom.!!!</span></p>
<h2><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF HIJAAB</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) AN ACT OF OBEDIENCE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is an act of obedience to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) (4) and to His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم (5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) a judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed,, Allah ordered that women must put on the Hijab (6)<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their <em>Juyubihinna</em> </span>(7)<span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah considered the dazzling display of beauty an act of ignorance:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of <em>Jahiliyeeyah</em></span>(8)<span style="color:#008000;"> (ignorance). &#8220;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">,</a> Most Glorified, says:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask the Prophet&#8217;s wives for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above Ayah (verse) does not apply only to the Prophet&#8217;s wives but to all of the believing women. Carefully read the following saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (9) (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The woman (i.e. any woman) is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em> (10)&#8221;, that is she must be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(4) <em>Subhanahu Wata&#8217;ala</em>, Most Glorified and Most High is He.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(5) صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم: <em>Salla Allahu Alaihi Wassalam</em>: May the <em>Salat</em> and Salaam (Peace) of Allah be upon His Prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(6)This is not something cultural. It is Allah&#8217;s order. Its conditions are not Arabian, Egyptian, Pakistani, Black or White American, etc. Its conditions are specified in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah to provide a protection and safeguarding of women. No one knows about what is good for men and women more than their Creator, Allah. His laws are Wise as it is the case with all of His actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(7) <em>Juyubihinna</em>: The respected scholars from <em>As-Salaf As-Saleh</em> (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(8) <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>: The days of ignorance prior to the Revelation of the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(9) No one can ignore the molestation of women that exists in the so called &#8220;open&#8221; societies. The question is: why it is happening? The answer begins to shape up when people think about the purpose behind creation. Allah created us for the single purpose of worshipping Him alone. He detailed all the ways to fulfill this purpose in the Last Revelation to all mankind, the Qur&#8217;an. In it we can find how women and men can safeguard their dignity, honor, and morality. The worship of Allah is manifested in the following of His orders. Allah orders that men and women must avoid all the roads that lead to animalistic ways of living. The Hijab is one of Allah&#8217;s commands. It is an honor and protection for women as well as a true freedom for her body from the hands and eyes of aggressors and molesters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(10) This hadeeth is narrated by Abdullah bin Masoud and collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is <em>Hassan-Ghareeb</em> i.e. good and <em>Ghareeb</em> (The <em>Ghareeb</em> is a narration by one narrator either in each level of the levels of the chain of narrators or in some levels of the chain). Also As-Suyouti hinted that it is authentic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB IS <em>IFFAH</em> (MODESTY):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made the adherence to the Hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that it is still better for them to keep their modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ ۖ وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wed-lock, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) in such a way as not to show their adornment; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things provided they do not make a display of their beauty; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about young women? Clearly they must stay modest find not display their beauty.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) THE HIJAB IS TAHARA (PURITY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had shown us the Hikma (Wisdom) behind the legislation of the Hijab:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask them (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the Hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by Hijab) and thus the prevention of <em>fitna</em> (evil actions) is very much manifested. The Hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:</p>
<h3> تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِي فِي قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ وَقُلْنَ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc.) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honorable manner.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:32)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) THE HIJAB IS A SHIELD</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah, Most High, is Ha&#8217;yeii </strong>(11)<strong>, Sit&#8217;teer </strong>(12)<strong>, He loves Haya&#8217; (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)&#8221;</strong>(13).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband&#8217;s home (to show off for unlawful purposes). has broken Allah&#8217;s shield upon her&#8221;</strong> (14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth demonstrates that depending upon the kind of action committed there will be either reward (if good) or punishment (if bad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(11) <strong>Ha&#8217;yeii</strong>: Allah is Bashful: He does not unravel the acts of disobedience by His slaves. They openly disobey Allah while they are in need of Him, yet He (being <em>Ha&#8217;yeii</em>) is ashamed of humiliating them leaving the door of repentance opened for them. If, however, they become arrogant and persist on the spread of evil, and disobedience, Allah certainly is All-Just in His infliction of punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(12) <strong>Sit&#8217;teer</strong>: Allah is <em>Sit&#8217;teer</em>: He provides means that shield against the uncovering of disobedient acts. The slaves commit acts of disobedience while Allah is providing them with many of His favors. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gives the opportunity for each one of us to return to Him in repentance and to seek His forgiveness. He loves those who do not like the spread of sin. He dislikes the Muslim who publicizes his acts of sin and disobedience. He loves the Muslim who does not unravel the sins of his brother in Islam while at the same time calls him to repent. The Hijab is something beloved by Allaah because it is a shield against the spread of evil manifested in the display of beauty to strangers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) THE HIJAB IS TAQWAH (RIGHTEOUSNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widespread forms of dresses in the world today are mostly for show off and hardly taken as a cover and shield of the woman&#8217;s body. To the believing women, however, the purpose is to safeguard their bodies and cover their private parts as a manifestation of the order of Allah. It is an act of <em>Taqwah</em> (righteousness ).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) THE HIJAB IS <em>EEMAN</em>(BELIEF OR FAITH)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not address His Words about the Hijab except to the believing women, Al-Mu&#8217;minat:</p>
<h3>وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And say (O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to the believing women.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Ayah Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَ<span style="color:#008000;">نِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span> يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the believing women&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33: 59).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;isha (<em>Radiya Allahu anha</em>)(15)) the wife of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), addressed some women from the tribe of Banu Tameem who came visiting her and had light clothes on them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If indeed you are believing women, then truly this is not the dress of the believing women, and if you are not believing women, then enjoy it.&#8221;</strong>(16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(15) <em>Radiya Allahu anhu</em> (<em>anha</em> or <em>anhum</em>): May Allah be pleased with him (her or them)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (16) Reported in &#8220;<em>Ma&#8217;alim As-Sunnan</em>&#8221; by Abu Suleiman Al-Khitabi in his explanation of Sunnan An-Nissa&#8217;ee V 4, p.376</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) THE HIJAB IS <em>HAYA</em>&#8216; (BASHFULNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Each religion has a morality and the morality of Islam is haya&#8217; (bashfulness).&#8221;</strong> (17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness is from belief and belief is in Al-Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong>(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness and belief are fully associated together if one is lifted the other follows suit.&#8221;</strong> (19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mother of the believers, A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;I used to enter the room where the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and my father were later buried in without having my garment on me, saying it is only my husband and my father&#8221;. But when Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) was later buried in (the same place), I did not enter the room except that I had my garment on being shy from Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>).&#8221;(20) The Hijab fits the natural bashfulness which is a part of the nature of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(17) Related by Imam Malik in his &#8220;Mu&#8217;wata&#8221; (2: 905-Arabic). The hadeeth chain is Mursal i.e. the chain of narrators is disconnected at one point or another. For example to say: &#8220;On the authority of A, on the authority of B, on the authority of C that the Prophet said &#8220;&#8230;.&#8221; . The hadeeth is Mursal if for example C did not hear directly from the Prophet. In the case of the above hadeeth, Ibin Habban connected the chain by two ways of narrators, both of them are weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(18) collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is: &#8220;a good and authentic hadeeth&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(19) Narrated by Abdul&#8217;lah bin Umar as Related by Al-Hakim in his &#8220;Mustadrak&#8221; (1/22-Arabic) who said: &#8220;it is a good and authentic Hadeeth…..&#8221; and Al-Thahabi confirmed Al-Hakim on this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(20) As-Simt Ath&#8217;ameeen Fee Maniqib Ummahat Ul-Mu&#8217;mineen, p.91:A Book by Ibn As-Sakir that represents a collection of the great attributes of the Mothers of Believers (The wives of the Prophet-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). AlHakim reported a similar narration and said that it is &#8220;good according to the conditions of Imam Bukhari and Imam Mulslim&#8221;, noting that both Imams did not discuss the chain of narration itself. Al- Thahabi had no comment about Al-Hakim&#8217;s narration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(8) THE HIJAB IS <em>GHEERAH</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab fits the natural feeling of <em>Gheerah</em> which is intrinsic in the straight man who does not like people to look at his wife or daughters. <em>Gheerah</em> is a driving emotion that drives the straight man to safeguard women who are related to him from strangers. The straight Muslim man has <em>Gheerah</em> for all Muslim women. Many in the world had lost this great moral aspect. In response to lust and desire men look (with desire) at other women while they do not mind that other men do the same to their wives or daughters! In &#8220;free&#8221; societies you see men sitting with strange women who are half-naked &#8220;enjoying&#8221; the scene! They introduce their wives to other strange men. Mutual looks here and there! Affairs develop and phone calls are exchanged. &#8220;Love affairs&#8221; destroys many families and children suffer most. What kind of &#8220;love&#8221; is this? The mixing of sexes and absence of Hijab kills the <em>Gheerah</em> in men. The eyes &#8220;eat up&#8221; other men and women! The inner &#8220;justification&#8221; is: since I can look they can look. It&#8217;s a &#8221; free choice&#8221;!! Few are those who feel anything when they discover their wives have &#8220;affairs&#8221;. They become numb!! No dignity ! No honor! The bottom line is that in many societies of this modern World the animalistic behaviors are becoming very apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said: &#8220;It was related to me that you women used to crowd the Kuffar (disbelieving men) from the non-Arabs in the markets; don&#8217;t you have <em>Gheerah</em>? There is no good in the one who does not have <em>Gheerah</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam considers <em>Gheerah</em> an integral part of faith .The dignity of the wife or daughter or any other Muslim woman must be highly respected and defended.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) COVERING ALL OF THE BODY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This respected author is in agreement with the position that the face and hands of the woman must be covered as he has detailed this in discussions of the Hijab issues in his book: &#8220;The Return of the Hijab, Part 3&#8221;. Some scholars say it is permissible to uncover the face and the hands of the woman as long as there is no <em>fitna</em> (infatuation) caused by her or inflicted upon her. They see that if: a) she is beautiful and beautifies her face and hands with external substances, and b) the society around her is corrupt where men do not lower their gaze, then it is prohibited for her to uncover her face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE A DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab itself must not be a display. Allah ordained it so as to cover the beauty of women and not for show off. He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And not to show of their adornment except only that which is apparent.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not logical that the Hijab itself be a source of display.(41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(41) Some women put on attractive covers on their heads. This is against the purity of the Hijab and its essence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(3) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE TRANSPARENT</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose must be achieved. In order for the Hijab to be a cover, it must not be made of transparent material making the woman covered only by name(!) while in reality she is naked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;In the latest part of my Ummah (nation of Muslims) there shall be women who would be naked in spite of being dressed, they have hair high like the humps of the <em>Bukht</em> camel, curse them, for they are cursed&#8221;</strong>(42).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added in another hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They will not enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> and would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance</strong>.(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that a woman could cause herself a grave and destructive sin if she puts on a garment that is thin and transparent and which clearly shapes her body&#8217;s features.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(42) At-Tabarani reported it and Al-Albani in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; said it is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(43) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it Saheeh as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibin Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) HIJAB MUST BE ROOMY, FLOWING AND NOT TIGHT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is a safeguard against Fitna. If tight, it will be descriptive of the woman&#8217;s body and this violates the purpose of Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Usaama Bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) dressed me with a thick Qubtyeeyah (cotton dress from Egypt) which was a gift that he received from Duhia Al-Kalbi. So I gave it to my wife to wear. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said : &#8220;What made you not to wear the Qubtyeeyah?&#8221; I said: &#8220;I dressed my wife with it. &#8221; He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &#8221; <strong>Order her to put an undergarment (or gown) under it, because I am afraid it may describe the size of her bones</strong>.(44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(44) Reported by Ad&#8217;Diya&#8217; Al-Maqdissi, Imam Ahmed, At-Tabarani, AlBaihaqi, and Ibn Sa&#8217;d. It is also reported that Al-Haithami said: &#8220;amongst the chain of narrators is Abdullah Ibn Aqeel whose narrations are good; yet according to some scholars there is Da&#8217;eef (weakness) associated with him, and that the rest of narrators are Thuqat (men of confidence regarding reporting). Ad-Dahabi said: &#8221; the level of Abdullah Ibn Aqeel&#8217;s narration is not below the rating of &#8220;good&#8221; (In Meezan AlI&#8217;tidal: Measure of Balanced (verifications); Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(5) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE PERFUMED WITH INCENSE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who perfumes herself and passes by some people that they smell her scent, then she is a Zaniyah (prostitute).&#8221;</strong>(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(45) Related by Imam Ahmed, An-Nissa&#8217;ee, and Al-Hakim who said: &#8220;it has an authentic chain of narration&#8221; and Ad-Dahabi agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(6) THE HIJAB SHOULD NOT RESEMBLE MEN&#8217;S DRESS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Women who assume the manners of men are not from us and also those of men who assume the manners of women.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-Huraira (رضي الله عنه) narrated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The prophet </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong> cursed the man who wears the dress of a woman and the woman who wears the dress of a man.&#8221;</strong> (47)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(46) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Abu Na&#8217;eem. Al-Albani authenticated it in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; (PP 66-67).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(47) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee, Imam Ahmed, Ibn Khuzayemah, Ibn Hab&#8217;ban and authenticated by the scholar Ahmed Shakir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) THE HIJAB MUST NOT RESEMBLE THE GARMENTS OF THE KUFFAR</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who takes the similitude (manner) of a certain people becomes one of them.&#8221; </strong>(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Umar (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saw me wearing two clothes dyed in saffron, whereupon he said: these are the clothes (usually worn) by the Kuffar, so do not wear them.&#8221;</strong> (50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(49) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ahmed (as part of a another hadeeth), Ibn Taymeeyah said that the hadeeth has a good chain of narration (i.e. that reported by Abu Dawoud) and that it is a &#8220;good hadeeth&#8221;; As-Suyouti said :&#8221;it is &#8220;Hassan: Good&#8221; and Ibn Hajar reported it in &#8220;<em>Fath Al-Bari</em>&#8221; and supported it with another evidence (a <em>Murssal</em>) with a good chain of narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(50) Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, hadeeth # 5173</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(8) THE HIJAB IS NOT FOR FAME!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who wears a garment designed for a worldly fame, Allah will make him wear a garment of humiliation on the Day of Resurrection then he will be set ablaze.&#8221;</strong> (51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The garment of fame is any garment a person wears to make him/her look famous. This applies whether the garment is highly precious and shows admiration to the life of this world or if it is chosen of a low quality to show lack of interest to this worldly life. The person may put on clothes with distinct colors so as to draw attention, act proudly and/or arrogantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(51) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ibn Majah, and Al-Munthari said that it is <em>hassan</em> (good) as well as Ibn Muflih. Imam As-Shawkani said: &#8220;The narrators of the chain are <em>Thuqat</em>&#8221; and Al-Alabni reported in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; p. 110 that it is <em>hassan</em> .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) WATCH FOR &#8220;CONCEALED&#8221; WAYS OF DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the various conditions about the Hijab one can clearly recognize that many of the young Muslim women are not fulfilling these conditions. They consider what they put on now, wrongly as &#8220;Hijab&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of the Islamic revival wanted to destroy it in its infancy by oppression and cruelty. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) defeated their plots and held the believing men and women steadfast in their obedience of Him (سبحانه و تعالى). The enemies of Islam realized that they should deal with the Islamic revival in a wicked way in order to sway this revival away from its course towards Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They started to spread innovated forms of &#8220;Hijab&#8221; as a &#8220;midway&#8221; solution by which the Muslim woman can &#8220;please&#8221; Allah (they claim so!) and at the same time &#8220;accommodate&#8221; her society and preserve her &#8220;beauty&#8221; and &#8220;glamour&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern &#8220;boutique&#8221; stores were declining in their trade due to the widespread use of the true Islamic Hijab. Suddenly, the markets were flooded with altered forms of <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj</em> under the name &#8216;modern/contemporary Hijab&#8217;. In the beginning this was protested and women were cautious. A group of &#8220;displaying women&#8221; who were embarrassed with the Islamic Hijab rushed towards the &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221; to &#8220;relief&#8217; themselves from the pressing social realities caused by the spread of Hijab. With time the phenomenon of &#8220;concealed display&#8221; became widespread and known as &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221;. Women friendly to this course think they are the best of girls and best of wives while in fact they are as one poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If they relate to the Hijab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong> It is the relation of an intruder</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So! O women of this kind be mindful to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and do not be deceived by those who may &#8220;bless&#8221; this action of yours and conceal their true intentions. Do not be deceived and let your response be: &#8221; I am better than those who are in a complete state of display!&#8221; There is no excuse to follow the evil. Know that the fire of Hell has different lower levels while Paradise has different higher levels. So it is proper to follow your sisters who truly adhere to the Islamic Hijab and its conditions. Aim high towards the highest levels of Al-Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Look at those who stand at lower levels than you (regarding worldly wealth) and those who stand at higher levels than you in religion (adherence to faith). for this would not make the favors (conferred upon you by Allah) insignificant (in your eyes).&#8221;</strong> (52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zohri reported (53) that Ummar Ibn Al-Khatab (رضي الله عنه) recited the saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily those who say: &#8220;Our Lord is Allah (Alone), and then they stood straight (i.e. they believed in the Oneness of Allah and worshipped none but Him (Alone) and obeyed Him for all that He ordered them) on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying); &#8220;Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of <em>Al-Jannah</em> which you have been Promised!)</span> (Qur&#8217;an 41:30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They, by Allah, followed the straight path of Allah by obeying Him and did not dodge like wolves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hassan Al Basri, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;If Shaytan (Devil) looks and finds you continuously adhering to the obedience of Allah he will seek you (i.e. check you) one time after the other. If he finds that you are still holding, he becomes weary of you and rejects you. But if you adhere one time and you do not another, then he becomes covetous: he wants to have you for himself.&#8221;</span> (54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So come on to a straight path that has no crookedness and a guidance that has no misleading ways in it, and to an honest repentance that has no disobedience in it:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And turn you all together to Allah (and beg Him) to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(52) The origin of this hadeeth was reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhari in the Book of Riqaq and Muslim in the Book of Az-Zuhd V.4, hadeeth # 7070, P 1530, and At-Tirmidhi in the Book of Qiyamah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(53) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Ibn Al-Mubarak. Imam Ahmed reported it in the Book of Az-Zuhd p. 115 and 110, respectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(54) Reported by Ibn Al-Mubarak in his book &#8220;<em>Az-Zuhd</em>&#8221; p. 7 # 20</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE HONEST MUSLIM</strong> receives the order of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and hastens to manifest his love to Islam into action and listens to and obeys the Sunnah of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He does not give attention to the lost and misleading ways of the masses of human beings who do not realize their awaiting destiny. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) negated the existence of belief in those who turn away from Him and from His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saying:</p>
<h3>وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا أُولَٰئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ</h3>
<h3>وَإِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They (hypocrites) say: &#8220;We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger (Muhammad-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and we obey&#8221;, then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers. And when they are called to Allah (i.e. His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuse to come and turn away.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 47-48 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand:</p>
<h3>إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<h3>وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ اللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَائِزُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The saying of the faithful believers when they are called to Allah (His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to judge between them is only that they say: &#8216;We hear and we obey.&#8217; And such are the successful (who will live for ever in <em>Al-Jannah</em>).&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiyyah, the daughter of Shayebah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;While we were at A&#8217;isha&#8217;s (<em>radi Allahu anha</em>) we mentioned the women of Qureish and their good favors, then A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;indeed the women of Qureish have a good favor and by Allah I have not seen better than the women of Al-Ansar in their strength of acceptance of the Book of Allah and in the belief in the Revelation: At the time when Surat An-Nur was sent down (and in it Allah says): &#8220;<strong>Let them (believing women) draw their veils over Juyubihinna</strong>.&#8221; soon their husbands turned to them reciting what Allah had sent down to them (i.e. the above Ayah), the man recites to his wife, his daughter, his sister and to every female relative. Not a single woman of them except that she took up her engraved <em>Mirt</em> (55) (wrapper) and covered her head and face in acceptance and belief in what Allah had sent down from His Book. The next morning they were behind the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), covered as if black crows were on top of their heads.&#8221; (56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is no choice but to submit the order of Allah and no hesitation should exist in following the ruling of Allah. So come for repentance, O My Muslim Sister, and watch for words like &#8220;<strong>I will repent, I will pray, I will cover with Hijab</strong>&#8220;, because delaying the repentance is a sin that you must repent from! Say as Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) said on the tongue of Moosa (May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) :</p>
<h3>عَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I HASTENED TO YOU, O MY LORD, TO PLEASE YOU&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 20:84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And say as the believing men and women said:</p>
<h3> سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;WE HEAR AND WE OBEY. (WE SEEK) YOUR FORGIVENESS, OUR LORD, AND TO YOU IS THE RETURN&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(55) With pictures of houses and dwellings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(56) Reported in The <em>Tafseer</em> of Al-Qur&#8217;an Al-Ath&#8217;eem by Ibn Katheer 5:90 (Arabic)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 78 : Points 133</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whichever woman gives herself away in marriage to a man, then she will not be permissible for him. They are both to be punished if he has violated her, unless the marriage is performed with a guardian (<em>walee</em>), two just witnesses and a dower (<em>sadaaq</em>) </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “ There is no marriage without a guardian (walee).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Ahmad, Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 2/558/no.2080) and at-Tirmidhee.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There is no marriage except with a guardian advising and two just witnesses.” </span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(1) TABARRUJ IS A DISOBEDIENCE TO ALLAH &amp; HIS MESSENGER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who disobeys Allah and his Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) can only harm himself and cannot in any way harm Allah. The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">:</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;All of my followers will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Who will refuse? &#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em>, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</strong> (21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Mu&#8217;awiyah (رضي الله عنه) gave a sermon in Humss (Syria) and mentioned that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prohibited seven things and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) named <em>Tabarruj</em> as one of them (22).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;oud (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8220;Used to dislike ten kinds of behavior and he (Abdullah) mentioned amongst them: &#8220;<strong><em>Tabarruj</em> by means of displaying beautification in an improper place</strong>.&#8221;(23). Imam As- Suyouti, may Allah&#8217;s mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;<em>Tabarruj</em> by displaying beautification is showing off to strangers and this is disliked. This is the explanation of &#8220;an improper place.&#8221; It is not so if the beautification is done for the husband<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(21) Saheeh Al-Bukhari (English-Arabic, Dar Al-Arabia, Publ. Beirut,Lebanon), V.9, hadeeth # 384, p.284</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (22) Related by Imam Ahmed in his Mussnad 4/101-Arabic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (23) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee in his &#8221; Sunan &#8220;Arabic 8/141.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(2) TABARRUJ IS A GRAVE DESTRUCTIVE SIN</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umay&#8217;mah, the daughter of Ruqay&#8217;ah came to the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to acknowledge the message of Islam and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I give my acknowledgment that you must not set partners to worship besides Allah and that you don&#8217;t steal or commit fornication and adultery, that you don&#8217;t kill your child, that you don&#8217;t commit any falsehood before your hands and between your legs, that you don&#8217;t wail, and that you don&#8217;t make <em>Tabarruj</em> like that of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em>&#8220;</strong> (24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) associated <em>Tabarruj</em> with grave destructive sins<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(24) Related by Imam Ahmed in his &#8220;<em>Mussnad</em>&#8221; 2/196. The scholar Ahmed Shaker, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said : &#8220;Its chain of narration is good&#8221;. He also said that Ibn Katheer in his &#8220;<em>Tafseer</em> :Explanation of the Qur&#8217;an 8: 327-328&#8243; mentioned this hadeeth saying, &#8220;its chain of narration is good&#8221; and he related it to At-Tirmidhi, An-Nissa&#8217;ee and Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) TABARRUJ BRINGS THE CURSE AND EXPULSION FROM THE MERCY OF ALLAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There shall be, in the latter part of my nation, women who are dressed but </strong>(in fact)<strong> naked, on their heads are humps like those of <em>Bukht</em> </strong>(one kind of camel)<strong>, curse them for they are surely cursed.&#8221;</strong>(25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(25) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;<em>Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer</em>&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it <em>Saheeh</em> as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibn Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(4) TABARRUJ IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE PEOPLE OF HELL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Of the people of Hell there are two types whom I have never seen, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with them. The second one, women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced </strong>(to wrong paths)<strong> and seduce others with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into <em>Al-Jannah</em> and they would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance.&#8221;</strong> (26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(26) Saheeh Muslim (English-Arabic, Published by Dar Al-Arabia, Beirut. Lebanon) V. 4 hadeeth # 6840 p. 1486.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) TABARRUJ IS DARKNESS ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The parable of a woman who moves with slow sweeping motion, trailing her beautified clothes, performing not for her husband, is like darkness on the Day of Judgment; she has </strong>(or comes with)<strong> no light&#8221;</strong> (27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(27) Related by Imam At-Tirmidhi in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; # 1167. Al-Albani said it is a weak hadeeth (See Al-Albani&#8217;s collection &#8220;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8221; (Collection of Weak Hadeeths) # 1800. Abu Bakr Bin Arabi, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;At-Tirmidhi related this hadeeth and said it is weak but its meaning is correct because the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; in disobedience is in fact torture and suffering……&#8221;. The meaning indicates that this type of women will come on the Day of Judgment Blackened in darkness as if she physically originated from darkness. In contrast, what appears to be difficult and painful in performance of obedient acts, is a true enjoyment because of the reward awaiting those who obey Allah and His Messenger e.g. the odor of the mouth of a fasting Muslim may not be pleasant in this world. To Allah, however, it is better than the odor of Musk because the Muslim had obeyed Allah and performed what is due upon him from fasting. Similarly the woman wearing her Hijab may be looked upon as &#8220;reactionary, old fashioned, a walking tent! etc.&#8221; She is the winner on the Day of Judgment and those who mock her put themselves on a dangerous road. They may be subjected to the wrath of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) TABARRUJ IS NIFAQ (HYPOCRISY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The best of your women is the affectionate , the fertile (in productivity), the propitious (favorable), the consultative if they fear Allah. The Most evil of your women are the <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> (those who do <em>Tabarruj</em>), the <em>Mutakhayelat</em> (who strut/swagger), and they are the hypocrite ones. Those who enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> are like the Cough Crow.&#8221;</strong> (28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Cough Crow has a red beak and red legs. This is an expression of metonymy indicating that few women enter Heaven because this kind of crow is rare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(28) Reported by Al-Baihaqi in &#8220;As-Sunan&#8221; V.7 p.82. Also reported by Abu Na&#8217;eem in &#8220;Al-Hiliyah&#8221; V. 8, p. 376 with a reference to Abdullah bin Masoud (رضي الله عنه) as the narrator. See also Al-Albani&#8217;s &#8220;Chain of Authentic Hadeeths &#8211; Arabic&#8221; # 1849 and 632.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) TABARRUJ IS DISGRACEFUL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home </strong>(to show off for an unlawful purpose)<strong>, has broken the shield between her and Allah.&#8221;</strong> (29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al- Man&#8217;nawi, may Allah have Mercy upon him, said: &#8220;The saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8216; any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home&#8217; means showing off her beauty to strangers by taking off her shield of clothes. She &#8220;has broken the shield between her and Allah&#8221; because Allah had said:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span>(Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a woman does not fear Allah and uncover her private parts then she is breaking the shield between her and Allah, Most High. And because she uncovered and dishonored herself and committed a treason with her husband, Allah will uncover her shield, she will be in a scandal&#8230; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(29) Related by Imam Ahmed and Al-Hakim in his &#8220;<em>Mustadrek</em>&#8221; (Arabic) V.4, p.288 who said it is <em>Saheeh</em> (authentic) according to the conditions of Muslim and Al-Bukhari, and Ad-Dahabi agreed as well as Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(8) TABARRUJ IS AN UNCHASTE AND DISGRACEFUL SIN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em>, All of her body is not to be shown (30). To wear the clothes that show off and shapes her body features is disgraceful and Allah  orders His slaves to stay away from disgraceful sins:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">وَإِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَا آبَاءَنَا وَاللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا<br />
قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When they commit a <em>Fahisha</em> (evil deed, going round the <em>Ka&#8217;ba</em> in naked state as in the times of <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse etc.), they say: &#8216;We found our fathers doing it and Allah has commanded us of it.&#8217; Say: &#8220;Nay, Allah never commands of <em>Fahisha</em>. Do you say of Allah what you know not?&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <em>Shaytan</em> (Satan) who orders such disgraceful sins. Allah  says:</p>
<h3><strong>الشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَاءِ</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<em>Shaytan</em> threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit sins.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 268)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijah</em> is a sinful virus that spreads disgraceful sins amongst the Muslim society. Allah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَاحِشَةُ فِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, those who like, that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you know not.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj is a leading cause for the spread of <em>Zina</em> (illegal sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) See footnote # 7.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) TABARRUJ IS A SATANIC WAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of Adam and his wife demonstrates how the enemy of Allah, Satan, was so covetous to incite them to show their private parts in order to spread evil and disgraceful sins. It also shows that the <em>Tabarruj</em> of women is a primary goal for <em>Shaytan</em> to achieve. Allah says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that Satan is the one who established the call for <em>Tabarruj</em> and show off and that he is the leader of those &#8220;leaders&#8221; who call for the &#8220;liberation of women&#8221;. Satan is the &#8220;Imam&#8221; of everyone who obeys and follows him in disobedience to Allah (The Most Merciful), especially those <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> who harm the Muslims and deceive their youth. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have not left after me any (chance) of turmoil more harmful to men than the harm done to the men because of women</strong>.(31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam forgot, made a mistake, repented and asked forgiveness from Allah and Allah the Oft-Forgiving accepted Adam&#8217;s repentance. The struggle between Adam&#8217;s off-springs and Shaytan continues. The devil still whispers to drive us , men and women, to disobey Allah and follow sin. There is no safeguard except in the return to Allah in good faith and repentance, remembering Allah, asking His help to overcome lust and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(31) Saheeh Muslim (English translation; published by Dar Al-Arabia) V. 4, hadeeth # 6603, p. 1431</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(10) TABARRUJ IS THE WAY OF JEWS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews have an important role in the destruction of nations through the <em>Fitna</em>. (seduction/temptation) of women. The spread of <em>Tabarruj</em> is an effective weapon of their widespread establishments. They have an extensive experience in this field. One should look around only to see who runs Hollywood and famous Houses of &#8220;Fashions&#8221; and &#8220;Magazines&#8221; as well as the world of advertisement!. R-rated, X-rated movies and clothes are widespread. In fact the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Watch out for this worldly life (safeguard yourselves from its temptations); avoid the allurement of women: verily, the first trial for the people of Israel was caused by women.</strong> (32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Books also testify to this fact. In the Third Chapter of Isaiah ( 16, 17):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord said: &#8220;Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with necks outstretched ogling and mincing as they go, their anklets tinkling with every step. The Lord shall cover the scalps of Zion&#8217;s daughters with scabs, and the Lord shall bare their heads.&#8221; Furthermore, &#8220;On that day the Lord will do away with the finery of the anklets, sunbursts, and crescents; the pendants, bracelets, and veils; the headdresses, bangles, cinctures, perfume boxes, and amulets; the signet rings, and the rose rings; the court dresses, wraps, cloaks, and purses; the mirrors,..&#8221; (Isaiah, 3, 18-23; The New American Bible).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) warned against mimicking the <em>Kuffar</em> (non-believers) and their ways, especially the ways of women. Many Muslims do not abide by this warning (33). This is a testimony for the prophecy of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You would tread the same path as was trodden by those before you inch by inch and step by step so that if they had entered into the hole of a <em>Dhab</em> </strong>(a desert lizard)<strong>, you would follow them in this also. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, do you mean Jews and Christians </strong>(by your words)<strong>&#8221; those before you&#8221;? he said: Who else (than those two religious groups).</strong> (34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The similarity of those women who disobey Allah and his Messenger to the Jews is very evident because their response to Allah&#8217;s commands was similar to that of the Jews:</p>
<h3>قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We have heard and disobeyed&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 93)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is unlike the response of the believing women:</p>
<h3>َقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We hear and we obey.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remember the saying of Allah:</p>
<h3>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell; what an evil destination!&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(32) Ibid, footnote # 31; Hadeeth # 6606, p.1432</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(33) It is sad to see many who dislike the Kuffar in certain ways imitate them in their ways of living thinking that their materialistic progress could not be achieved except in acting, dressing, eating, jogging, sleeping ..like them. The true Muslim, however, remembers that any progress must meet the purpose for our presence on earth: all action must be related to the worship of Allah. The Kuffar have taken some of the means which Allah had created and used it for worldly gains. We are ordered to make the means adhere to the purpose of our creation: the worship of Allah Alone and thus uses the means to defend Islam and Muslims and secure the needs of life as well. Why should some of us dress the way Allah ordered and some does not? Should we choose Allah&#8217;s way or the Kuffar way? All the success is measured by one criterion: does it meet the pleasure of Allah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(34) A famous and Saheeh hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others. The text here is as reported in Saheeh Muslim V. 4, hadeeth # 6448, p.1403</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(11) TABARRUJ IS A FILTHY JAHILYEEYAH (IGNORANCE)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described the times of ignorance as filthy and wicked and ordered us to reject it. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) described the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as :</p>
<h3>يُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He allows them as lawful <em>At-Tayyibat</em> (all i.e. good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful <em>Al-Khaba&#8217;ith</em> (all i.e. evil and unlawful as regard things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.)&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call to bring about the times of Jahilyeeyah is similar to the call for Tabarruj, both of which are wicked ways that the Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made unlawful. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! every matter of Jahilyeeyah is under my feet!&#8221;</strong> (35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj and all forms of Jahilyeeyah such as false pride and haughtiness, ill thoughts about Allah, call for falsehood, setting up rivals with Allah, ruling by other than the laws of Islam, usury, etc., are all included.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(35) Related by Abu Dawoud, At-Tirmidhi, Ibin Majah, and Ad-Darime&#8217;i and Imam Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(12) TABARRUJ IS AN ANIMAL ACT, RETARDATION (DECADENCE) AND DECLINE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To reveal and expose are natural behaviors of animals. Whenever man inclines towards such behaviors he starts his decline to a level lower than the level of manhood which Allah had bestowed upon him. Allah bestowed a natural inclination (<em>Fitrah</em>) towards covering, preservation, and safeguarding modesty. To consider the acts of display, exposition, and uncovering as acts of beauty reflects a corruption to the <em>Fitrah</em> and a degeneration in taste and a sign of decadence and decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The progress of man&#8217;s civility is linked to his/her covering of the body. The Hijab cover is fitting to the instinct of <em>Gheerah</em> which draws its strength from the soul. The so called &#8220;liberation from the chains of covering&#8221; is an instinct that draws its strength from lust which incites <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing of the sexes. The one who is satisfied with this latter instinct must sacrifice the first one in order to silence the voice of the innate <em>Gheerah</em> in his heart in return for the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; of <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing. From this we understand that the <em>Tabarruj</em> is a sign of corruption of <em>Fitrah</em>, lack of bashfulness, <em>Gheerah</em>, and insensitivity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(13) TABARRUJ IS A DOOR TO WIDESPREAD EVIL</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who carefully examines the Islamic Texts (Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah) and the lessons of history, becomes convinced about the evils of <em>Tabarruj</em> and its harm, both on religious and worldly matters especially when it is associated with the mixing of sexes. Some of its underlying consequences are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Competition amongst the Displaying Women in Showing Off their Beauty. This is seduction, and it leads to the spoiling of morality and leaves women as merchandise articles exhibited for anyone to look at.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Corruption of the Morality of Men, Especially the Youth and Those in Adolescence. It pushes them to commit various kinds of sins (36).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Destruction of Family Ties and Causing a Lack of Trust Between Family Members and the Spread of Divorce.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Commercial Abuse of Women In The World of Advertisement, Entertainment And Other Areas As Well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Doing Harm to Women by Declaring Their Ill Intentions and Evil Conscience Thus Rendering Her Venerable To Harm By The Wicked And The Insolent.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Spread of Diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn&#8217;t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result, plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong> (37)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Facilitates The Sin of <em>Zina</em> (Fornication) By The Eye.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The adultery of the eyes is the lustful look. .&#8221;</strong> (38)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tabarruj</em> Makes it Difficult to Lower The Gaze.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Justifiably Brings Down Allah&#8217;s Punishment</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishment of Allah is more severe than atomic bombs and earthquakes. Allah  says:</p>
<h3>وَإِذَا أَرَدْنَا أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا فَحَقَّ عَلَيْهَا الْقَوْلُ فَدَمَّرْنَاهَا تَدْمِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when We </span>(39)<span style="color:#008000;"> decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allah and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its Population] who are given the good things in this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When people see wrong </strong>(or evil)<strong> and they don&#8217;t change it, then it is imminent that the punishment of Allah will fall upon them.</strong> (40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(36) You may have seen teen-age kids on the corners of many streets in Europe and in North America rooming around, smoking to get high, half naked, and on drugs looking to engage in sex. Why? What happened? Many try to hide from the hard facts! The drive for lust and materialistic life became the &#8220;god&#8221; of the new generations: the Pepsi-Michael-MTV- Jackson generations. The result: AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(37) Part of a lengthy hadeeth related by Ibin Majah, Abu Na&#8217;eem, and Al- Hakim who said: &#8220;it has a good chain of narrators&#8221;. Ad-Dahabi agreed to Al-Hakim&#8217;s report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(38) Saheeh Muslim V.4, hadeeth # 6421 p. 1397</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(39) &#8220;We&#8221; Plural Pronoun: Is used to stress the Greatness and Power of Allah Who is One. It is common with Semitic languages for any Monarch to use Plural Pronoun. It is also used by members of the Royal Family in England. To Allah, however, belong the Highest and most Perfect Example.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 96</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> and marrying a woman merely to make her lawful for her previous husband (<em>al-Isti<u>h</u>laal)</em> are forbidden till the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F393947286&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/temporary-marriage-of-convenience-al-mutah-is-forbidden-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> (jurisprudence). However, he brought it here because it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). Because <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) is to declare as lawful something which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made forbidden. And what this term <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) means; to marry a woman for a certain set period whether it be long or short and after it, then the marriage ends automatically and does not require divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mut`ah</em>; this temporary marriage, it used to be permissible at the beginning of Islaam and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade it at the Battle of Khaybar.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Then he permitted it on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then he forbade it forever.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to begin with, it was lawful then it was made forbidden. Then it was permitted then it was forbidden forever. And the Muslims are united in consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> that it is forbidden and that it is <em>nikaa<u>h</u>un baa<u>t</u>il</em> (baseless marriage). And there is consensus of this nation that it is forbidden, no-one disagrees with regard to that except for the <strong>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Ja`firee Shee`ah</strong>. They are the ones who contradict with regard to it. And their differing is not counted and has no value. So there is consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) and text to show that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> is forbidden. It is a futile marriage and it has the ruling of <em>zinaa</em> (fornication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><em>“al-Mut`ah tan-nisaa,”</em> </strong>Why did Imaam al-Barbahaaree say <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em>, meaning <em>Mut’ah</em> of the women, excluding by that <em>Mut`ah</em> of Hajj, which is that a person does <em>Tamattu</em>`, performing `Umrah and then performing Hajj. This is not what is meant here, for Hajj <em>Tamattu</em>` is what was supported by the majority of the People of Knowledge and no-one disagrees with regard to it except a small number but as for <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em> of the women meaning temporary marriage, then it’s forbidden by consensus, no-one disagrees about it from those whom disagreement is counted. Whereas, Mut’ah in Hajj is a matter of fiqh but as for Mut’ah, which is temporary marriage, then it is a matter, which has a connection to aqeedah (creed and belief) because it is making permissible that which Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made forbidden.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Khaybar, the well-known battle against the Jews of Khaybar in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (4,261) and also reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,407) from Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade temporary marriage to the women on the day of Khaybar and he forbade eating the meat of domestic donkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <u>H</u>adeeth for that reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,406) from Sabrah al-Juhanee that, He was with Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O people, I have permitted you to take pleasure from the women and Allaah has forbidden that now until the Day of Resurrection. So, whoever has something from them then let that go on its way and do not take from anything that you have given to them.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded us with <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage) in the year of the conquest when we entered Makkah then we did not depart from it until he had forbidden us from it.”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[The following article has been extracted from Al-Ibaanah e-Book :<br />
<a title="Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children : Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/fleshblood/">Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children</a> – Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool ]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that children are a source of trials (<i>fitnah</i>).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that surely, with </b><b>Allaah is a mighty reward.” </b>[Surah Al-Anfaal 8: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is stated in <i>Adwaa-ul-Bayaan</i>: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah ordered the people in this noble ayah to be aware that their properties and children are a trial for them by which they will be tested. Will your wealth and your children be a cause for you to fall into that which Allaah is displeased with?! Elsewhere (in the Qur’aan), He adds to this saying that wives are also a trial just like wealth and children, thus ordering the individual to beware of them putting him into that which Allaah is not pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He orders the individual – if he should see something he dislikes from these enemies who are the closest and most special of people to him, i.e. his children and wives – to forgive them, pardon them and not hold them accountable. So he should beware of them firstly and then pardon them if some thing should occur from them. This is found in His statement in Surah At-Taghaabun:</p>
<p>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَادِكُمْ عَدُوًّا لَّكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ ۚ وَإِن تَعْفُوا وَتَصْفَحُوا وَتَغْفِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ &#8211; 64:14</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ &#8211; 64:15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, verily among your wives and your children are enemies for you, so </b><b>beware of them. But if you pardon (them) and overlook and forgive (their faults), then </b><b>verily, Allaah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful. Your wealth and your children are only a </b><b>trial, whereas Allaah – with Him is a great reward.’ </b>[Surah At-Taghaabun 64: 14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asserts somewhere else (in the Qur’aan) that it is forbidden for the believers to let their wealth and children divert them from His Remembrance, stating that whoever let’s this happen is a loser who has been duped out of his shares. The ayah being referred to is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ &#8211; 63:9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, let not your properties or your children divert you from the </b><b>Remembrance of Allaah. And whosoever does that, they are the losers.’ </b>[Surah AlMunaafiqoon 63: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b>‘fitnah’</b>, as mentioned in these verses, means a trial and a test. This is one of the many meanings this word possesses in the Qur’aan.” [28]</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither the wife nor the children of an individual will pick up the burden of his shortcomings and deficiencies on his behalf. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَامُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ ۚ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ &#8211; 60:3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Neither your relatives nor your children will be of avail to you on the Day of </b><b>Resurrection. He will judge between you. And Allaah is All-Seer of what you do.” </b>[Surah Al-Mumtahanah 60: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So children are a source of <i>fitnah </i>– they are a trial and a test. Allaah will test us by them. So we should fear Allaah with regard to them and give them the proper rights that they deserve. Or should we forfeit these rights, when Allaah will ask us about them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (rahimahullah) reported: ‘Ubaidullaah bin Ziyad went to visit Ma’qil bin Yassaar while he was suffering from the illness that he eventually died from. So Ma’qil said: “I will indeed narrate a hadeeth to you that I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . I heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘There is no servant whom Allaah has granted responsibility over a group of </b><b>people, then fails to look after them in an honest manner, except that he will not </b><b>experience the fragrance of Paradise.’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There is no servant whom Allaah has granted </b><b>responsibility over a group of people, then dies on the day that he dies whilst in a state </b><b>of deceiving his people, except that Allaah makes Paradise forbidden for him.” [</b>29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Children are a source for causing one to divert away from the Remembrance of Allaah. At times, they may even lead you to disobey Him. In these cases, they are an enemy that you should beware of!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has instructed us how to expiate this <i>fitnah</i>. Hudhaifah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported: “We were sitting one day with ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said:‘<b>A man’s trials with regard to his </b><b>family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, </b><b>and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>” [30]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Book on Talaq</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125- Talaq which complies with the Sunnah and ruling on uttering the divorce three times in one session or in case of anger</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to the respected brother; may Allah grant you success! Amen.<br />
As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kindly be informed that I have read your letter which contains some questions. They are answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 1: What is the prescribed way of Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband) in the light of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The prescribed way is that the husband declares the divorce one time when his wife is pregnant or in a state of purity and he has not engaged in any sexual relations with her. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#339966;"><em>O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods)</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the latter divorced his wife when she was menstruating. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about his son’s action to which he replied: Command him to take her back, and keep her till she is purified, then has another period, then is purified. If he wishes he may keep her and if he wishes he may divorce her before having sexual intercourse, for that is the `Iddah (woman&#8217;s prescribed waiting period after divorce or widowhood) which Allah commanded for the divorce of a woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another report narrated by Muslim from the Prophet (peace be upon him) reads: Then he can divorce her when she is pure (not menstruating) or pregnant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 2: Is declaring Talaq three times in the same session regarded as one divorce or three divorces?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Three divorces uttered at the same time is only to be counted as one according to the soundest view of scholars. It was authentically reported in Sahih Muslim on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the (pronouncement) of three divorces during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr and for two years of the caliphate of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) was deemed as one time of divorce. Then, `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;People hasten in a matter in which they are required to observe respite. So, it is recommended to impose it upon them,&#8221; and he imposed it upon them. It is evident that the divorce in this way is counted as a threefold divorce according to Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) made by `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Yet, it is better to follow the authentic Sunnah than following Ijtihad made by `Umar or others for the benefit of the Muslims. This is supported by the report narrated by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad through an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) from Ibn `Abbas that Abu Rukanah made three pronouncements of divorce and later regretted. So, he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) who returned his wife to him, and said: It is one divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 3: In a state of rage, a husband said to his wife: &#8220;I divorce you thrice.&#8221; He later regretted and wants to take her back.What is the ruling on this act?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: According to the most correct opinion of scholars, <strong>Talaq is not effected if it is declared &#8211; once or thrice &#8211; in a fit of anger.</strong> They have to prove the claim that the apparent state which caused divorce is true. On the other hand, when anger is so intense that a person is no longer aware of what he is doing or saying, the divorce is not effected according to Ijma` (consensus of scholars). In this case, he is like one who is insane and one who has lost all power of reason due to unintentional drunkenness. Uttering divorce in a state of intentional drunkenness does not become effective due to loss of reason. `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) issued a Fatwa that supported this view and it was followed by a group of people of knowledge, because it was based on Shar`y (Islamically lawful) evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to guide all Muslims to understanding the religion and holding fast to it, for He is the One Who is capable to do so. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">A FRIDAY SERMON BY: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, there is a certain well known pastime of tribulation and temptation into which many people fall today. Unfortunately, this issue does not negatively affect only the individuals who fall into it. Rather, its consequences affect others as Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Beware of a trial which will not afflict only those who have transgressed among you exclusively, and know that Allah is severe in penalty.</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, the tribulations to which I refer are temptations pertaining to (the unlawful admiration of) women, and it is such trials about which the messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will not leave behind a trial more harmful to men than (the temptations of) women.</span></strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a trial which the shameful ones readily partake in, one that affects their desires, blinds their eyes, and destroys their judgment. This eventually leads them to following women around in the streets and shopping malls, flirting with them, whistling at them and whispering to them. They may even go so far as to touch or grope women in public as if they are completely unconcerned with others around them. Perhaps they see others as insignificant as if they were cattle. This is because such people are immersed in their own lust. They belittle morality and they defy societal norms. They are fearless before Allah (Azza wa Jal) as they choose ways (to support their desires) other than the respectable ways of sensible people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must, as a believing Muslim people, renounce these activities perpetrated by such immoral individuals. We detest these types of behaviors because they contradict the characteristics and qualities of believers in Allah and the last day. We disapprove of such actions because they are means leading one closer to adultery or fornication about which Allah (تعالى)  says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not approach adultery, fornication. Certainly, it has always been immoral and an evil way</span></strong>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We condemn this behavior (of chasing after women, watching them desirously, flirting with them, etc.) because it infringes upon personal safety and security, and it could lead to community fear, panic (among women), and societal disorder. And we criticize it because it may inevitably bring about a swift, overwhelming and inclusive punishment. Allaah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When we intend to destroy a town, we command its affluent ones, but they defiantly disobey. So the word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.</span></strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, <strong>&#8220;We command&#8221;</strong> is a type of universal responsibility befitting those of affluence and power (to enforce change in society). Allah mentions the <strong>&#8220;affluent ones&#8221;</strong> because it is often the rich and powerful who immerse themselves in sin. And if they refuse to change, <strong>&#8220;The word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</strong> After mentioning His punishment for adultery and fornication (among other sins), Allah then speaks about the exception, those who will avoid punishment, the true worshippers of the Most-Merciful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does that incurs sin. The punishment will be multiplied upon him and he will abide therein disgraced, except for those who repent, believe, and do righteous deeds. For them, Allah will replace their bad deeds with good ones and Allah is ever forgiving, merciful.</span></strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, You who try to safeguard your dignity and protect the women in your care, immoral qualities and shameful behaviors such as these to which some people degenerate—and such behavior was not prevalent in our society until recently—weaken your religion, weaken your honorable protectiveness of women, and spread the means leading to tribulations and societal problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Weakening of One’s Religion</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s religion, these people who follow women around, being tested with admiring and flirting with them, had they been strong in religion, they would not dare do the kinds of things they do with women. Such actions result in their sinning against Allah (azza wa jal)  and preoccupying themselves with and giving preference to the creation instead of the creator. Allah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Tell the believing men to lower their gazes and protect their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of everything they do.</span></strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Weakening of One’s Honorable Protectiveness of Women</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s honorable protectiveness – the praiseworthy type of respectful jealousy one should have of women – individuals afflicted with this temptation to “chase women,” had they had the complete respectful honor for women, they would not dare chase after the women of their brothers (in faith), the women (sisters, daughters, mothers) of their fellow citizens, thereby putting those women into the same types of temptations and tribulations. The type of religious brotherhood we have obliges men to respect and honor his brothers’ womenfolk and those of his fellow citizens, having the same kind of commendable jealousy for their honor and chastity as he has for his own female relatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would ask these men: Would you be happy to know that someone chases after your own wife out of desire for her? Or your daughter, your sister, or other female relatives? Would you like people flirting with them? If he would hate such behavior with his own women, why would he allow his own desires to tempt him into doing the same things with other women? I warn these individuals who have been afflicted with such admiration of women from the very actions which would allow another man to gain influence over his own women. I advise them to prevent his relatives from becoming afflicted with such trials.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Spreading of Tribulations &amp; Societal Problems</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations and temptations to admire and chase after women are many. Such behavior (because of its popularity and influence) leads to various forms of widespread media, including audio, visual, and written publications, being placed in the hands of our young men and women. They have newspapers and magazines filled with images and articles that arouse their desires, stimulate their emotions, and kindle the fires of passion. Even worse than this media is that which comes to our land from abroad, or sometimes even from our own citizens. We ask Allah to guide them and to protect us from their evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another way this tribulation may spread is by the very blessings which Allah has bestowed on this land: the comfort of its society, its excess wealth, good food, and the overall security and prosperity of our society. Oftentimes, such luxuries lead one’s heart to become empty and the body to become idle from inactivity or unemployment. This is why you almost always find these young men to be one of two types. They are often unsuccessful men who have no careers to occupy their time or attention. They live off the prosperity of other wealthy, successful men. They neither know a skill, nor try to learn one. They do not work towards a specific occupation or official career. Thus, his desires get the better of him and leave him in a perpetual downfall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or they may often be men who may work but they waste the results of their labor, wasting their earnings, unconcerned with its value or what results from the bad consequences of their actions. But as for a dignified, determined believer, he does not allow his personality to deteriorate to the point of such shallow yet despicable behavior. Other ways these temptations spread is what some women of immoral conduct themselves perpetrate in their choice of clothing, their appearance, and lustful behaviors. By these choices, they are inclined to promote this type of tribulation. Such conduct was foreign to our righteous predecessors. Some women go to shopping centers to flaunt themselves, to exhibit their beauty with the most attractive clothing they own. They may then throw over it a thin cloak but one that might be shortened or raised up so that her attractive clothing underneath is displayed. They are dressed yet still appear naked, wearing the types of garments the women of Hell wear. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of the people of Hell that I have never seen: (1) People with whips like the tails of cattle with which they beat people, and (2) women who are dressed but appear naked, walking with an enticing strut with their heads looking like the humps of camels. They will never enter Paradise, nor even smell its fragrance although its scent can be perceived from such and such a distance. [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some women also frequent shopping centers adorned with gold jewelry or elegant watches, walking in such a manner and revealing her hands (in an attractive, seductive way) to entice those who see her even though Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They (believing women) should not strike their feet in such a manner that the adornment they hide may be known</strong></span>. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women go out perfumed, sometimes choosing to wear the strongest, most fragrant perfume so that almost every man she passes who smells her scent, she allures him with it. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said about this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Any woman who has been around incense should not join us in the last evening prayer.</span></strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A woman, if she wears perfume and then passes by a gathering (of men), she is this and that (meaning: a type of adulterer, fornicator).</strong> </span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women frequent the malls unveiled or wearing a thin veil that barely conceals her face. Perhaps it is even worn as a way of beautifying her face, or just to hide some blemish on her face. Still other women may cover their faces yet they wear the veil so tightly that their nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are shown. These are no doubt temptations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You also find women roaming shopping centers in a strutting, swaying manner and joke and giggle with their girlfriends. Sometimes they visit shops, with or without need, to chat with the salesman, prolonging their conversation. Perhaps she requests an item stored in the back of the shop that she actually does not want; she just wants to keep chatting with the salesman. Yet Allah (Azza wa Jal) told the prophet’s wives and they were considered the “mothers of the believers,” they were the most pure and farthest from any behaviors or situations of temptation – Allah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not be soft in speech (to men) for fear that he in whose heart is a disease should desire (you), but speak in an honorable manner.</strong></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, we have described some things regarding the sickness but is there a cure? The answer is yes and there are several types of medicine thanks to Allah. We are a Muslim nation practicing the religion of Islam, and Allah (Azza wa Jal) has clarified the general responsibilities a man has regarding his family members and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has spoken about this as well. As for Allah (Azza wa Jal) He says in His noble book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You who believe, protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are (appointed) angels, stern and severe. They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do as they are commanded.</strong></span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The leader is a shepherd and responsible for his flock (i.e., citizens). A man is a shepherd over his family and responsible for his flock. A woman is a shepherd in her husband’s home and responsible for her flock. And a servant, worker is a shepherd over the property of his master, boss. So each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.</strong></span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Worshippers of Allah, fear Allah and fulfill your responsibilities. Continuously prevent and discourage the women in your care from visiting shopping centers to behave in manners that contradict religious rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to help us and you with regards to the medicine of integrity and honor, to guide us and guide others with us for He is capable of all things. All thanks are for Allah, the lord of the worlds, and may Allah send peace and prayers on our prophet, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn continues in the second part of his Friday sermon…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslim brothers. You, men who are caretakers of women, men who are responsible for your families, fear Allah with respect to yourselves and families. Cultivate in them respectable manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and discourage them from becoming the very means which lead to temptations and tribulations. You are men and they are women and men have been charged with taking care of women because of what Allah has given one over the other and because men (are obliged to) spend their wealth to support them. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man should neither be (helpless, having no influence) as if he were simply a rock in his house, nor should he be as if he is one of the women. Rather, he must act like a man in every sense of the word. Be shepherds; be responsible and influential so that you live among your families as men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people go to great measures to ensure their financial stability, carefully watching their expenses, their checkbooks and bookkeeping. Yet they neglect their family members for whom they are personally and immediately responsible. Such a man, were he to lose a single sheep from his flock (a single coin, for example), he would search right and left for it until it is found. All the while, he remains unconcerned that his family members, his sons and daughters, are losing their manners and good character.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are protectors and maintainers of women by what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend (to support them) from their wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fulfill the obligations Allah has placed over you. This is my advice I present to you as I remind you that you are responsible for your families because Allah told you this and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has charged you with this. Do you want to waste this trust you have been given? Do you want to be unable to answer when you are made to stand in front of Allah and asked about this trust?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allah and take seriously the obligations Allah has placed on you. Do not neglect and waste your chances at raising your family. If you fail in the upbringing of your family and this man fails his family and that man fails, soon the entire society becomes corrupt. Society is a conglomeration made up of individuals, so when the individuals become corrupt the entire population is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conclude this speech of mine asking Allah (Azza wa Jal) to assist us and you all in fulfilling our responsibilities we have regarding the safeguarding of our families. Oh Allah, help us care for our families, providing the best care for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Islaam has also prohibited a man from being in privacy with a woman – which means that he is alone with her in an isolated area with no one else present – since this leads to the occurrence of fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Beware of entering in the presence of women.”</strong> The Companions said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what about the male in-laws (i.e. the husband’s male relatives)?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <strong>“The male in-laws are death.”</strong> [9] This means: The danger of these family members is greater. Why is this? It’s because a woman is less restrained from her husband’s male relatives as compared to other males. Her refraining from them is minimal. But in spite of this, there must be caution and awareness applied to a husband’s male relatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what we hear about today from some ignoramuses that a husband’s brother, paternal uncle or other male relative can greet his wife, shake her hand, be alone with her and enter into her presence – this is baseless. It is not permissible for a nonmahram to enter into the presence of a woman (without Hijaab), nor to shake her hand, nor to be alone in privacy with her unless there is someone else in the house through which the privacy will be removed. But as for him entering into a house that has no one in it but her, and he is not one of her mahaarim, then this is the forbidden type of privacy and it is dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of this is if he enters an empty room – there being no one in there but him and her. This is not permissible since it is a means that leads to fitnah. This is even the case if the man that is alone with her in this private area is a doctor. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“No man is alone in privacy with a woman except that the Devil is the third party amongst them.”</strong> [10] This means that the Devil is present and makes falling into immorality appear pleasant to them. This is since he is always calling to fitnah and takes advantage of this opportunity to spread immorality between them. In order to cut off the pathway of the Devil and his supporters as well as the path to corruption, the Legislator has restricted men from being alone with women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the new forms of this forbidden type of privacy that has appeared in our times is a <strong>woman riding in a car by herself with a driver that is not mahram to her</strong>. So he takes her to the school, to the market and even to the masjid! This is not permissible. It is not permissible for a woman to ride in her car alone with a driver that is not a mahram to her because this is from the prohibited forms of privacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #008000"><strong>&#8220;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband&#8217;s absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband&#8217;s property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great</strong></span>.&#8221; [Qur&#8217;an 4:34 &#8211; Muhsin Khan Translation]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the sons of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was ailing. Abu Talhah went out and the boy died in his absence. When he came back, he inquired, &#8220;How is the boy?&#8221;. Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, &#8220;Better than before&#8221;. Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: &#8220;Arrange for the burial of the boy&#8221;. In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him of the event. He enquired, &#8220;Did you sleep together last night?&#8221; Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which the Prophet (ﷺ) supplicated, &#8220;O Allah bless them.&#8221; Thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: &#8220;Take up the boy and carry him to the Prophet (ﷺ)&#8221;; and he sent some dates with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) enquired, &#8220;Is there anything with him?&#8221; He said; &#8220;Yes, some dates&#8221;. The Prophet (ﷺ) took a date, chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date around the baby&#8217;s gum and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn &#8216;Uyainah relates that a man from the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this &#8216;Abdullah, every one of whom had committed the Noble Qur&#8217;an to memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of the family: &#8220;Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son until I mention it to him myself.&#8221; Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said, &#8220;O Abu Talhah! If some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. She said, &#8220;Then hope reward for your son&#8221;. Abu Talhah got angry, and said; &#8220;You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. &#8220;He went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him about the matter. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, &#8220;May Allah bless the night you spent together!&#8221; He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. When Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to come back to Al-Madinah from a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people came near Al- Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained with her and Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: &#8220;O Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.&#8221; Umm Sulaim then said: &#8220;O Abu Talhah, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to me: &#8220;O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) tomorrow morning.&#8221; The next morning I carried the baby with me to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and narrated the rest of the story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وعن أنس رضي الله عنه قال‏:‏ كان ابن لأبي طلحة رضي الله عنه يشتكي، فخرج أبو طلحة، فقبض الصبي، فلما رجع أبو طلحة قال‏:‏ ما فعل ابني‏؟‏ قالت أم سليم وهى أم الصبي ‏:‏ هو أسكن ما كان، فقربت إليه العشاء فتعشى، ثم أصاب منها، فلما فرغ قالت‏:‏ واروا الصبي، فلما أصبح أبو طلحة أتى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخبره، فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏أعرستم الليلة ‏؟‏‏&#8221;‏ قال‏:‏ نعم ، قال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏اللهم بارك لهما، فولدت غلاماً، فقال لي أبو طلحة‏:‏ احمله حتى تأتى به النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وبعث معه بتمرات، فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏أمعه شيء‏؟‏‏&#8221;‏ قال‏:‏ نعم، تمرات فأخذها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فمضغها ، ثم أخذها من فيه فجعلها في فيّ الصبي ، ثم حنكه وسماه عبد الله‏.‏ ‏(‏‏(‏متفق عليه‏)‏‏)‏ ‏.‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وفى رواية لمسلم‏:‏ مات ابن لأبي طلحة بن أم سليم ، فقالت لأهلها لا تحدثوا أبا طلحة بابنه حتى أكون أنا أحدثه، فجاء فقربت إليه عشاءً فأكل وشرب، ثم تصنعت له أحسن ما كانت تصنع قبل ذلك، فوقع بها، فلما أن رأت أنه قد شبع وأصاب منها قالت‏:‏ يا أبا طلحة، أرأيت لو أن قوماً أعاروا عاريتهم أهل بيت فطلبوا عاريتهم، ألهم أن يمنعوهم‏؟‏ قال‏:‏ لا، فقالت ‏:‏ فاحتسب ابنك‏.‏ قال‏:‏ فغضب، ثم قال‏:‏ تركتني حتى إذا تلطخت أخبرتني بابني‏؟‏‏!‏ فانطلق حتى أتى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخبره بما كان ، فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ ‏&#8221;‏بارك الله في ليلتكما‏&#8221;‏ قال‏:‏ فحملت، قال وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في سفر وهي معه، وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا أتى المدينة من سفر لا يطرقها طروقاً فدنوا من المدينة، فضربها المخاض، فاحتبس عليها أبو طلحة، وانطلق رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال‏:‏ يقول أبو طلحة‏:‏ إنك لتعلم يارب أنه يعجبني أن أخرج مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا خرج، وأدخل معه إذا دخل، وقد احتبست بما ترى، تقول أم سليم‏:‏ يا أبا طلحة ما أجد الذى كنت أجد، انطلق، فانطلقنا، وضربها المخاض حين قدما فولدت غلاماً‏.‏ فقالت لي أمي ‏:‏ يا أنس لا يرضعه أحد حتى تغدو به على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فلما أصبح احتملته فانطلقت به إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ وذكر تمام الحديث‏.‏</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter Six<br />
Nifass And Its Rulings</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nifass</strong>: is the bleeding due to delivery by a pregnant woman. It may occur with delivery, after delivery (post-natal) or before delivery (by two or three days coupled to contractions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;The blood seen when the woman starts her contractions is Nifass and it is not limited to two or three days. These contractions are followed by delivery or otherwise the released blood is not Nifass&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether there is a limit on its duration. Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Nifass has no limit on the duration of its shorter or longer periods. Assuming that a woman sees a flowing of blood for more than forty, sixty, or seventy days and then the blood flow stops. This kind of bleeding is Nifass. Suppose, however, that the bleeding continues, then a limit of forty days is set as Nifass because this period is the common period encountered by most women&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This author said: &#8220;based upon the above, if the bleeding of a woman continues beyond forty days and if there are signs that indicate that it will come to a stop (based upon previous pregnancies or some other signs), then she should wait until the blood flow stops. If none of these signs are encountered by a woman, then she cleans herself (bath) upon the completion of forty days considering it the reference period for most women. On the other hand, if upon the completion of her forty days she gets her normal menses then she should wait until it ends. If the blood continues after her regular menses ends, then she is a Mustahadah and should apply the rules of Istihadah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Nifass bleeding stops before the forty day-reference period and she becomes clean, then she should take a bath, pray, fast and she may engage in sexual intercourse with her husband. The stopping of the flow of blood for less than a day does not qualify her to be clean (as mentioned in Al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nifass is not confirmed unless the woman delivers a human being with clear features. If a small body is delivered but clearly does not show the developed features of a human being, then the associated bleeding is not Nifass and it is considered as Irq blood (blood from a blood vessel). The least period for which a human form can develop is eighty days starting from the day of conception and most often it is ninety days. Al-Mujid Ibn Taymeeyah [57] said: &#8220;If she sees blood coupled to contractions prior to the 80/90-days she should not give it any consideration (i.e., she continues to pray and fast) but if she sees blood after this period she should then refrain from praying and fasting. If, however, she delivers her load and the new born has developed human features, then her bleeding (prior the 80/90 days) should be considered as Nifass and she should correct for her missed prayers and fasting. If on the other hand the newborn does not show developed human features then her bleeding should still not to be considered as Nifass and does not have to make up for her prayers and fasting.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Laws of Nifass</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The laws of Nifass are the same as the laws governing menses, except in the following cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <strong>The Idda is not related to Nifass, but rather to the rules of divorce</strong>. For example: if Talaq (divorce) was declared prior to delivery, then the Idda ends upon delivery and is not related to the Nifass period. If Talaq was declared after delivery, she waits for the return of her menses and accordingly calculates her Idda as explained earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) <strong>The period of Eelaa&#8217;</strong>. The Eelaa&#8217; is when the husband makes an oath to indefinitely (or for more than four months) not to have sexual intercourse with his wife. If his wife demands sexual intercourse, a period of four months starting from the day he took his oath, will be set. If this period is completed he will be ordered (by a Muslim Judge) either to perform sexual intercourse with his wife or request of separation by his wife will be fulfilled. Nifass will not be counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period. An increment equal to the period needed for the wife&#8217;s Tahara from Nifass will be added towards the Eelaa&#8217; period. This is in contrast with menses (Haid), whereby its period is counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) <strong>Puberty</strong>: It is clear that Nifass is related to pregnancy. A woman cannot get pregnant before she has her own sexual secretions. Haid (and not Nifass) indicates that puberty had been reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) <strong>What if the flow of Nifass blood stops before the forty days period and then resumes on the fortyth day?</strong> In contrast with Haid blood [58], the state of this resumption is considered to be &#8220;doubtful&#8221; according to famous sayings by the Hanabilah scholars. She, according to them, must fast and pray on time . All that which is forbidden on the Haa&#8217;id is forbidden on her, except obligatory acts. She must compensate all that which the Haa&#8217;id must compensate for. This author, however, is with the opinion that: &#8220;If the blood resumes within a period that may be a Nifass period, then her blood is Nifass blood. If not, then it is a Haid blood unless it continues to flow and it will then be an Istihadah blood. This opinion is close to that reported in Al-Mughnee (V.1, P. 349) in which it is mentioned that Imam Malik have said: &#8220;If she sees blood two or three days after its flow had stopped, then it is Nifass blood or otherwise it is a Haid blood.&#8221; This is also the choice of Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realistically, there can be no &#8220;doubt&#8221; about blood. It is, however, a relative matter in which peoples&#8217; opinions may vary depending upon their knowledge and understanding. The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) are sources of clarification for everything. Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not make it mandatory for someone to fast twice or make Tawaff twice except when there is something done wrong during the performance of these acts for the first time and that it cannot be corrected without actually making it up. However, in the case when someone performs a certain act to the best of his/her ability then he/she is relieved from any responsibility as Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { لا يُكَلِّفُ الله نفساً إلاَّ وُسعَها } (البقرة، 286<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 286)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاتَّقوا الله ما استَطَعتُم } (التغابن، 16<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can&#8221;</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 64: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <strong>What about sexual intercourse with a woman who becomes clean prior to the forty days-reference period of Nifass?</strong> In the case of the Haa&#8217;id, sexual intercourse is permissible if she becomes clean prior to her &#8220;normal&#8221; duration of her cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the case of Nifass and in accordance with the well known opinion of the Hanbali school of thought, sexual intercourse is disliked. The right opinion, however, is that it is not disliked and this is also the saying of the majority of Muslim Scholars, because to make something disliked requires a supporting evidence from Islamic Law. In this case there is no evidence except that which Imam Ahmad related: &#8220;the wife of Uthman the son of Abi Al-&#8216;Aass approached him before the end of the forty -day period and he told her: &#8216;do not!'&#8221;. This does not necessitate that he disliked what she did because it is possible that he was acting cautiously being afraid that she was not certain that she was Tahira (clean from Nifass) or that bleeding may be re-activated following intercourse with her or for some other reason- and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] Al-Mujid Ibin Taymeeyah: Is the grandfather of the famous Ibin Taymeeyah. He was also a highly respected scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] If menses blood stops and resumes then it is certainly Haid blood. For example, a woman has her normal monthly cycle for eight days. She says that the blood stops on the fourth day for two days and then it resumes on the seventh and eighth day. This resumed blood is a certainly a Haid blood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very regrettable thing with regard to this matter which is the carelessness of some women concerning travelling by airplane without a Mahram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are very negligent in this matter: One finds women travelling by airplane alone, and their <strong>justification</strong> for doing this is that they say that her Mahram escorted her in the airport from which the airplane took off and the other Mahram will meet her in the airport at which the airplane lands, and that in the airplane she is safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This justification is weak in reality, because the Mahram who accompanies her does not admit her onto the airplane, he only admits her to the departure lounge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may also be that the airplane is delayed in taking off and so this woman remains lost, or the airplane might take off and then be unable to land at the intended airport due to some reason or another, and so it lands at some other place, else and so this woman will be lost. Or, the airplane might land at the intended airport, but the Mahram who is supposed to meet her does not arrive due to one reason or another, such as illness, sleep or a car accident which prevents him from getting there, or something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if all of these things did not happen, and the airplane landed at the correct time of arrival and the Mahram who was supposed to meet her was present, there might be some man sitting next to her on the airplane who does not fear Allah, the Most High and does not respect the worshippers of Allah, and he might be attracted to her and she to him, which might lead to Fitnah (temptation, trial) and unlawful deeds, as is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent upon a woman to fear Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and not to travel except with a Mahram. It is also incumbent upon women&#8217;s male guardians whom Allah has made protectors and maintainers of women to fear Allah, the Almighty, the Ail-Powerful, and to avoid being negligent to those they are Mahrim for, and losing their zeal and their religion, for a person is responsible for his family. Because Allah, the Most High has made them a trust for him; He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <strong>unlawful</strong> for a menstruating woman to perform all types of fasting: obligatory or optional.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, obligatory to <strong>make up for the missed obligatory days</strong> of fasting as explained by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;We passed through this (period of menstruation), and we were ordered to complete (i.e., compensate) the fasts but we were not ordered to complete the prayers&#8221;</strong> </span>(agreed upon Hadeeth) [34]<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9F0" target="_blank">.</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the woman encounters menses while fasting then her fasting is negated even if her blood flow occurs a moment before sunset. If this day is one of the prescribed days of fasting then she must make up for this day once she becomes clean<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9F0" target="_blank">.</a></span> If on her day of fasting she feels she is about to have her menses but no blood flow actually occurs till after sunset, then her fasting is complete and is not negated in accordance with the right opinion about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there is no ruling regarding blood inside the woman&#8217;s body and because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge)?&#8221;<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> he replied: &#8220;Yes, if she notices a discharge.&#8221;</strong></span> [35]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) conditioned the ruling upon the actual seeing of the discharge and not upon its transfer (from inside-out). Similarly in the case of Haid, the ruling applies once there is an actual seeing of discharge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: If a woman&#8217;s period continues till after dawn (Fajr), then no fasting will be acceptable from her on this day even if she becomes clean moments after dawn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: If she becomes clean before Fajr and she fasted, then her fasting is correct even though she may have not taken her cleaning bath till after Fajr time. This is the same as in the case of the person who has Jannabah. If he (she) intends to fast and did not take his (her) bath until after Fajr, then his (her) fasting on this day is correct. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to get up in a state of Jannabah (after sexual relations with his wives) and fast during the month of Ramadan.&#8221;</strong></span> [36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p>[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.<br />
[34] The text is from Saheeh Muslim, V.1, P. 191.<br />
[35] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P. 171-2, Hadeeth # 280.<br />
[36] Aisha (رضي الله عنها) said: &#8220;The dawn broke upon the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) during the Ramadan in a state of Jannabah not becuase of sexual dream</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 10:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Suppose a woman becomes clean from her menses before Salat Al-Fajr but she took her bath after the commencement of the Salat time, and fasted that day. Is her fasting correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman becomes clean during the month of Ramadan one minute before the commencement of the prescribed time of Salat Al-Fajr, then she must fast that day and her fasting is correct and it is not mandatory upon her to make up the fast because she fasted while she was clean even though she did not take her bath till after the rise of Fajr. This is similar to the case when a man has a wet dream or in a state of Jannabah. He can have his Suhor (meal before Fajr), fast and take his bath after Fajr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I want to caution some women who may think that if they get their menses after breaking the fast and before Isha&#8217; then their fasting was incorrect. This understanding is wrong. Their fasting is correct and complete even if they get their respective periods one moment after sunset (Maghrib).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 6:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A woman has reached sixty five years of age. She did not give birth to any child during the last nineteen years. For the past three years she had continuous bleeding. What should she do for fasting and what should women like her do (regarding Salat and Fasting)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of woman should refrain from fasting and Salat during the time of her regular cycle of menses. If for example she used to have her normal period of menses during the first six days of the month, then she should refrain from fasting and praying during the first six days of each month. Once that is done, she should take a bath and perform Salat and fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the how she offers her Salat, she should wash her private part real well and apply a pad to it and make ablution. She does this at the time of the obligatory prayers. She could also do the same for the optional prayers at times other than the times of the obligatory prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the difficulty encountered by such woman, it is allowable for her to combine (but not shorten) the Thuhr with the &#8216;Asr prayer (and pray either at time of Thuhr or at time of &#8216;Asr) and the Maghrib with the Isha&#8217; (and pray either at time of Maghrib or at time of Isha&#8217;). This way she can do this type of preparation for her Salat three times (including one for Fajr prayer) instead of five times a day. She can perform optional prayers based upon her ablution for either of the combined prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 5:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What should a woman do when she does not make up for the days she did not fast in Ramadan due to her menses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is regrettable for something like this to happen amongst the believing women. This is either due to ignorance or laziness and both reasons are wrong! because the cure for ignorance is to ask those who know and the cure for laziness is the fear of Allah and His punishment. So a woman who may have done this should sincerely repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness. She should also try her best to find out the number of days she missed and make up for it. I ask Allah to accept the repentance of such women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second question of Fatwa no. 6495</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on the blood that comes out of a woman outside the menstrual or post-partum period? Should she make up later for the days in which she experiences such blood during the daytime of Ramadan? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the blood referred to above comes out of her during the daytime in Ramadan and it is not menstrual blood or postpartum blood, she is obliged to observe Sawm (Fasting) and Salah (Prayer). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>She must <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> stop observing Sawm or Salah, and she <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not</span> need to make up later for the days in which she observed Sawm and Salah while having Istihadah (abnormal vaginal bleeding outside the menstrual or post-partum period). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q: It is known that the scholars disagree as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) on jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed.What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this issue? Supposing that it is obligatory to pay Zakah on them, is there a Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) for this? If there is a Nisab, it seems from the Hadith that indicate the obligation of giving Zakah on jewelry &#8211; where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) warned against the punishment of Fire awaiting those who do not pay the Zakah &#8211; that there is no Nisab. How is this resolved? [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is a famous controversy among the scholars as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah on gold and silver jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The preponderant opinion is that it is obligatory, according to the general evidence on the obligation of Zakah on gold and silver</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two heavy bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, “Do you pay Zakah on these?” She said, “No.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?” She threw them down and said, &#8220;They are (I have given them away) for the sake of Allah and His Messenger.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically <span style="color:#008000;">reported from Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, “O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?” He (peace be upon him) said, “Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.”</span> [3] The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not tell her that there is no Zakah on jewelry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these Hadith refer to jewelry that reach the Nisab, when they are combined with other evidence, as Hadith explain one another just as Qur’anic Ayahs (verses) explain one another, and also Hadith explain Ayahs and make their generality specific and their absoluteness limited, because all of them are revelation from Allah (Glorified be He). Whatever comes from Allah is not contradictory; in fact they confirm and explain one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary that a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) must be completed (on jewelry) as is the case with other categories of Zakah wealth, such as money, commercial commodities, and livestock. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Inhibitors is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There is no associated harm on the woman. Because Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تُلقُوا بأيديكُم إلى التَّهلُكَة } (البقرة، 195<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not throw yourselves in destruction&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 195).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تَقتُلوا أنفُسَكُم إنَّ الله آانَ بكم رحيماً } (النِّساء، 29<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not kill yourselves surely Allah is Most Merciful to you&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: If its use affects the husband in one way or another, then his permission should be first sought. For example, if a woman is going through her Idda and the husband is obligated to spend upon her, then she is not allowed to prolong her Idda (by using Haid inhibitors) in order that she can receive more of his spending. She should request his permission. Similarly it is not permissible to use such inhibitors without the husband&#8217;s approval if it is known that the inhibitors will prevent her becoming pregnant. It is better not to use these inhibitors except under the above conditions and when there is a real need for that, because leaving the matter as natural as possible is better for the balance of health and safety of the woman.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Stimulants is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There must be no abuse of its use. For example, to excuse herself from certain mandatory acts of worship like using stimulants right before the month of Ramadan so as to be excused from fasting or from prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: The use of stimulants must be permitted by the husband because the presence of Haid prevents him from having full enjoyment with his wife. Also, if she was divorced, then this will quickly drop off the husband&#8217;s right of returning her because it will hasten the end of her Idda. This applies to the case when the declared divorce is of the type known as Revocable Divorce in which the husband has the right to return his wife before the end of her Idda.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Questions &amp; Answers</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Haid Inhibitors</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q1: What is the ruling regarding on the use of Haid-inhibitory pills during the month of Ramadan?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As long as there is no harm in their use and as long as the husband permits this, then it is permissible to use these pills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it came to my knowledge that these measures can harm the woman, especially when it is known that the release of blood by menses is a natural process. To prevent this natural way may cause certain harm to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the use of these pills can effect the regulation of the periodical cycle itself and that leaves her in doubt and confusion regarding the offering of her prayer and whether she is able to have sexual intercourse with her husband or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this and other associated reasons, I cannot say that the use of these pills is unlawful but I do not like it and do not encourage it. I say that the woman should accept what Allah had ordained for her and should consider the answer of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his wife &#8216;Aisha when she had her menses after she made Ihram for Umra. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked &#8216;Aisha: &#8220;May be that you got your menses?&#8221;. &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then said,&#8221;This is the thing which Allah has ordained for all the daughters of Adam&#8221; [62]. The woman should then be patient and seek the reward from Allah. If she is unable to perform Salat and fasting because of her menses, the door is still opened for her to celebrate the praises of Allah, give charity and do good to people and such acts are great acts of worship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five &#8211; ISTIHADAH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ISTIHADAH is the vaginal bleeding of a woman such that it may not stop or it may stop but for a short period of time (a day or two in each month).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) <strong>Bleeding that does not stop:</strong> &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) related that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish said to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I do not become clean (i.e., bleeding is not ending)</span> and in one narration &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and I do not become clean</span>&#8221; [49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>Bleeding that stops for a short period of time</strong>: Humnah bint Jahsh came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">My menstruation was great in quantity and severe</span>&#8220;[50].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Several States of Istihadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE</strong>: The woman has a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. The woman in this case refers to her previously known period of menses and during this period she applies all the rules regarding Salat, Fasting etc. Bleeding in days other than this reference period is considered as Istihadah with all associated rules being applicable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman used to get normal bleeding for six days at the beginning of each month. She then started to have prolonged bleeding. For this woman her <strong>Haid (Menses)</strong> period should be the &#8220;first six days of every month&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following extra vaginal bleeding is her Istihadah. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) who narrated that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers? He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied: No, this is from a blood vessel. <span style="color:#008000;">Give up the prayers only for the days on which you usually get the menses and then take a bath and offer your prayers</span>&#8220;[51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Muslim, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Umm Habeebah bint Jahsh who had a prolonged flow of blood to &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">refrain (from prayer) during your menstrual period, then wash and pray</span>&#8221; [52]. Having done this she should pray and pay attention to any flowing blood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TWO</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. To be able to distinguish between her blood from normal menses and her Istihadah blood, she should watch for some characteristics of these two types of blood. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Haid blood may be characterized by thickness, darkness or certain distinct odor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: a woman sees a continuous blood flow but she sees it dark for the first ten days and red for the rest of the month. Or it looks thick for the first ten days and soft for the rest of the month, or for the first ten days it has the characteristic odor of Haid blood and it becomes odorless for the rest of the month. So her Haid period is the dark blood flow for the first example, the thick blood for the second and the one with the distinct odor for the third. The bleeding that follows is considered Istihadah. It is related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Abi Jahsh: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">When the blood of menses comes, it is black and can be recognized; so when that comes, refrain from prayer, but when a different type of blood comes, perform ablution and pray, for it is (due only to) a vein</span>.&#8221; [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THREE</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of Haid and lacks the distinctive characteristics mentioned above!. Blood flow is continuous carrying the same quality or flowing with abnormal qualities that make it hard to distinguish the Haid bleeding from that of the Istihadah bleeding. In this case, women encountering this prolonged and undetermined type of flow should consider their Haid period to be the period encountered by most women: 6-7 days of Haid flow per month, starting from the time she sees the flowing blood. Other than this period, the blood flowing should be considered as Istihadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman sees her blood for the first time on the fifth day of the month and it continues to flow while she is unable to distinguish any difference in color, odor or thickness of blood. Her Haid period should be six or seven days starting on the fifth day of each month. This is in lieu of the Hadeeth of Hamnah bint Jahsh (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha). She said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Messenger of Allah I am a woman who menstruates in great quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting&#8221;</span>. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, put it on your private part, for it absorbs the blood. She replied: &#8220;It is too copious for that&#8230;&#8221; In this Hadeeth, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash and when you see that you are purified, and quite clean, pray during twenty three or twenty four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you.&#8221;</span> [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8220;for six or seven days&#8221; is not meant to give Hamnah bint Jahsh the choice but just for her to examine and find out who (amongst other women) is closer to her in age, body structure, number of children, etc. the woman that mostly resembles her condition has a Haid period of six days, then she should consider this period as her reference. The same is true if the Haid period was seven days.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The One Who Resembles The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that something (e.g. surgery) may cause the flow of blood through the vagina. There are two types of this case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) It is not possible for her to have menses following surgery e.g. removal of the uterus or its blockage. Under this case, the ruling of Istihadah cannot be applicable. If the woman sees blood, then the laws governing the <strong>yellowish discharge</strong> (see above) apply. Hence she should not refrain from performing prayers or fasting. It is not prohibited for her husband to have sexual intercourse with her and it is not obligatory upon her to have a bath. She must, however, wash, clean, and make ablution at the commencing time of the obligatory prayers and when she intends to offer the optional prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is not certain that her menses will stop following surgery. It is possible that she may have menses. In this case the rulings applicable on a Mustahadah (woman going through Istihadah) are also applicable on this condition in lieu of the Hadeeth of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is from a blood vessel, so when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (have a full shower) and offer your prayers.&#8221;</span>[55] The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;when the real menses begins&#8221; indicates that the rules for the Mustahadah woman are applicable upon the woman who, potentially, may have menses (with a beginning and an end). The woman, however, without a potentially occurring menses, her blood is a vessel blood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Rulings About The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier it was explained when the blood is considered a menses (Haid) blood or Istihadah blood. The rulings applicable for menses and Istihadah depend upon the type of the flowing blood. Rulings about menses were discussed earlier. The rulings about Istihadah are the same as those applicable to a clean woman except for the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) It is obligatory upon the Mustahadah to perform Ablution for each prayer, because of the order of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;Then make Ablution for every Salat&#8221; [56], meaning that she should make ablution only when the prescribed time of Salat begins and not before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Prior to ablution she should wash the traces of blood and covers her private part with a pad of cotton to absorb the blood. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Humnah bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, for it absorbs blood.&#8221; She said: &#8220;it is too copious for that&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said; &#8220;then take a cloth.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;it is too copious for that.&#8221; He said: &#8220;then Talaj&#8217;jami&#8221; i.e., to prepare a holding around the waist that will maintain the cotton pad tightly attached to her private part. Nothing that comes out should then harm her because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Hubaish: &#8220;Refrain from Salat during the days of your normal menses then wash and make ablution for every Salat and then pray &#8220;even if blood drops onto the mat!&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Sexual Intercourse: Scholars disagreed about its permissibility. The correct opinion is that it is permissible because many women (ten or more) had their Istihadah at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allah and His Messenger did not prevent spouses from engaging in sexual intercourse. In fact, the saying of Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساء في المَحيض } الأية (البقرة، 222<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Keep away from women during menses&#8221;</span><br />
(Qur&#8217;an 2: 222),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is an evidence that it is only obligatory to keep away from sexual intercourse with women only during menses. And since offering prayers is allowed while in Istihadah, then there should be no difficulty in having sexual intercourse. To prevent sexual intercourse based upon Qiyass (analogy) with the state of Haid is incorrect, because the two situations are not the same. Deduction of rulings by Qiyass is invalid whenever there are existing variations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: During Menses, it is not unlawful to celebrate Allah&#8217;s Praises (Saying Takbeer, Tasbeeh, and Tahmeed),[29] saying Bismillah before acting upon something (eating, drinking, etc..), reading Hadeeth, Islamic discussions, invocation upon Allah (Dua&#8217;), and listening to the recitation of Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed by &#8216;Aisha (radhi Allaahu anha) that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;lean on my lap and recite Qur&#8217;an while I was in menses&#8221;</span> (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Umm &#8216;Atiyya reported that she heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stayscreened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221;</span> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: The reciting of the Qur&#8217;an by a menstruating woman either via direct looking or silently (in her heart) without the actual uttering by the tongue is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars are with the opinion that it is not prohibited for her to utter the Qur&#8217;anic recitation. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Jareer At- Tabaree and Ibn Al-Munthir, Imam Malik, and Imam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (in one of his earlier sayings) are with the opinion that it is permissible for her to recite the Ayah (verse in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Basically, there is no Sunnah to prevent her from reciting Qur&#8217;an. The &#8220;hadeeth&#8221; that: &#8220;A menstruating woman and the one who is in state of Jannabah [32] should not recite anything of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221;, is a weak hadeeth as agreed upon by the knowledgeable scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact women at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to have their monthly cycles of menses.Had the recitation of Qur&#8217;an been prohibited for them (as it is the case with Salat) then the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have made it clear to his Ummah (Islamic community) and his wives would have known about it and they would have dissipated this knowledge to the people. Because no one had related a prohibition by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about this issue, then it cannot be made unlawful especially when it is known that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not prohibit it at the time when menses was very much present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, recitation by the tongue is not Haram (legally unlawful).[33] This author said: &#8220;having known the dispute between the scholars about this matter, then it is more proper for the menstruating woman not to recite Qur&#8217;an by the tongue except when it is necessary e.g. if she is a teacher or if she is preparing for an exam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Takbeer: saying Allahu Akbar (Allah is The Greatest); Tasbeeh: saying Subhana Allah (Most Glorified is Allah); Tahmeed: saying Al Hamdulil&#8217;lah: All Praise is due to Allah.<br />
[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P.179, Hadeeth # 296.<br />
[31] Agreed upon Hadeeth. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic- English), V. 1, P. 192, Hadeeth # 321.<br />
[32] Jannabah: Is the state in which a man (or a woman) has sexual discharge during sexual intercourse or in a dream, etc. In this state a Muslim is not allowed to pray or do other kinds of worships unless and until he (she) performs Ghusl (have a full shower) or do Tayammum if he/she cannot use water for any reason.<br />
[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.</p>

Translation and Video by  aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#808080;">In our country the means of transport are in groups and mixed and sometimes touching some women might occur accidentally or unwillingly in result to the crowding, so are we sinful upon that? And what do we do when we don&#8217;t have any other way (in transport) and we are in need of it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymîn</strong>: What is obligatory upon the man is to avoid touching women meaning to crowd (women) where his body touches/attaches to their bodies even behind a barrier. As that is a call to fitna and the human is not infallible, as he could see himself to be cautious regarding these matters and not being affected by it however;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Shaytân circulates in the body of a son of Adam as his blood circulates in it</span>.&#8221; (Bukhârî).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps he makes a move that will corrupt his way. Therefore, if the human is compelled into this like a necessity that is inevitable and he is diligent knowing that he will not be affected (by the fitna) then I hope that there&#8217;s no harm upon him. However in my opinion I think that he is not forced into this an inevitable necessity as he can look for a place that is not near a woman even if he stood up . And by that he will get rid of this matter that will bring fitna. And what is an obligation is that he fears Allâh Almighty the best way he can and not belittle these matters. And we also hope from those who organize the means of transportation to make a specific place for women so men cannot reach them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Scholar: Allamah Imam Muhammad bin Salih bin Uthaymin</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: ibnothaimeen.com/all/noor/article_6493.shtml</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Video by: aFatwa.com (site is down)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for the virgin woman who has no wali (guardian) or without his presence to marry herself off or not? And is there in this ruling a difference between a virgin or a previously married whether divorced or widowed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymin</strong>: It is not permissible for the woman to marry herself off or others whether she is a virgin or previously married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is because Allâh, Glorified and Exalted, has made the contract of marriage in the hands of other than the woman as He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not marry polytheistic women</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In men He said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not let marry polytheistic men</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He added that the marriage is for the husband himself but with the women He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not let marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made the marriage in the hands of other than the woman and He, Glorified and Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">Do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:232)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the narration of the Prophet, peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There&#8217;s no marriage without a wali (guardian).</strong></span>&#8221; (Bukhâri)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that is the proof of the narration that there&#8217;s no other option for the woman than with a guardian marrying her off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As from the point of view then the woman is deficient in intellect and religion as she is limited in thinking and she is also weak in religion and I say this from the narration of the Messenger of Allâh, peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I have not seen anyone more deficient in intellect and religion than you. A cautious sensible man can be led astray by some of you</span>.&#8221; (Bukhâri)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the saying of Allâh Almighty:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allâh has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it wasn&#8217;t for the deficiency of the woman then a man would not be in charge of her but rather in the âyah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">by [right of] what Allâh has given one over the other</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the woman was in such description, as the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah indicated, from deficiency of intellect and religion then she is in need of a guiding guardian who knows the appropriate/capable and knows the interests of marriage and knows who the woman is for him until he decides to marry her off or refrain (from such). This is why there should be a guardian for the woman to marry her off within the known requirements to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the woman shall not marry herself off whether she is a virgin or previously married. However, there is an issue that should be noted/addressed which is that a woman must be asked for permission and consent whether she was a virgin or previously married and whether the one who marries her off is her father or anyone else. And the most correct saying is that it is not permissible for the man to marry his daughter off or anyone else until she agrees upon that husband and gives permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if she is a virgin then her permission is enough by being silence and if she stated/uttered to agree then that is better/complete however being silent is enough. And if she is previously married then she must state (speak) to agree and says &#8216;Yes&#8217; that she agrees to marry this man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the guardian whether it is the father or anyone else, he must describe the suitor to the woman with a description that will take her to know him (suitor). So he does not say &#8216;do you want me to marry you to such&#8217; until he clarifies to her the situation of this man and his description because as much as the man wants in a woman in beauty and righteousness, a woman wants this too in a man in beauty and righteousness. Therefore the man must clarify to the woman whose permission is sought (for marriage) in a way which takes her to know him but vagueness will not lead to the goal. Of course if the woman trusts fully her guardian and will suffice with what her guardian sees and she asked for example &#8216;are you happy/convinced with him (the suitor)&#8217; in regards to his religion and to his manners then this would suffice if she trusts him and she is pleased with what he (guardian) is pleased with.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Below is the introduction by the major scholar Ash-Shaykh Muqbil Bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee Rahimahullaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am familiar with what the author, Umm Salamah bint &#8216;Alee Al-&#8216;Abaasee has written entitled <strong>Al-Intisaaru li Huqooqee al- Mu&#8217;minaat (supporting the rights of the believing women)</strong>. I found it to be a beneficial book, as it contains verses from the Book of Allah and traditions from the Messenger of Allaah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. The Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah are beneficial knowledge. Whoever does not seek guidance from then will not find guidance in anything else as our Lord subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221;In what other speech except Allah and His proofs will you believe?&#8221; (sooratul-Jaathiyyah 45:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She performed a great duty in selecting the topic of the believing women&#8217;s rights. Many people are neglectful in this area, or they leave it off altogether. Therefore, she reminded the fathers, close male family members, and husbands about what Allah has made obligatory upon them, as well as what He has strongly suggested for them to do. Allaah subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221;Oh you who believe, save yourselves and your family from a fire which is fueled by men and stones.&#8221;  (sooratut-Tahreem 66:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily in the author are gathered some praiseworthy traits: these include abstaining from worldly pleasures, exemplary character, spreading beneficial knowledge, and not wasting her time. She spends her time by herself in the women&#8217;s library, substitute teaching for Umm &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah when she is absent, and effective lecturing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily the islamic community is in great need of righteous women who can care for their Muslim sisters so that the corrupted and corrupting callers do not lead them astray. The wives of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam as well as the female companions played a major role in spreading the prophetic traditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, I advise the author and her sisters to make a great effort in spreading beneficial knowledge from the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, the prophetic traditions, and the &#8216;Arabic Language, to become knowledgable in Allaah&#8217;s Religion, to place an importance on spreading that knowledge by writing and inviting to Allaah, and teaching the ignorant women. If Allaah guides one woman by your hand, it is better for you than a red camel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah firmly establish us all on what He loves and pleases Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] <strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her own money without the permission of her husband? And what if she knows prior to that, that her husband does not agree with her disposing of her money, even if it is for charity? And also, what about giving away her jewelry which she bought with her own money, without his permission. What is the ruling concerning this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The ruling on this matter is clear from the hadeeth of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to freely dispose of her wealth except with the permission of her husband.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a hasan saheeh hadeeth, hasan by itself and saheeh based on its various routes of narration. And as for all the reports that it is thought present a contradiction to this hadeeth, then it is not correct to rely on that or claim that they contradict the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth in which the women gave their rings and earrings away in charity, as is reported in the Saheeh, then this has been responded to from many different angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is that it was probable that these charitable donations were given with the permission form the husbands of these women. And it is also possible that this event occurred before this ruling that occurs in the hadeeth became firmly established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So due to this, we advise every Muslim woman that adheres to acting on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah to not give away from her wealth without the permission of her husband. This is because it will be a cause and a reason for the occurrence of disputes between the couple, and the end result of that will be very bad.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in the case where a husband is mean and oppressive to his wife (by not granting her permission), she can take her case to the legal jurisdiction. And this is especially the case since today, the legal jurisdictions are in favor of the women. And in a more particular example, in cases like these, all of the judges are in agreement that the woman may freely dispose of her money without the permission of her husband. So if the matter is taken up to the court and the judge rules that this action was a violation on the part of the husband to his wife and he rules that she can give away her money, (she may do so). But if her husband objects and holds that by her doing so, she will be squandering money, at that point the judge can prevent her because, even though he bases it on the rule that it is allowed for her to spend from her wealth, he can not permit her to give away in charity that which is considered excessiveness and a squandering of money. And Allaah knows best.</p>

So if the girl has not reached the proper age and has been forced into marriage, she can look for a way to dissolve this marriage after having reached the age of comprehension and maturity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there was a girl that was forced into marriage during the time of the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. After the marriage, she went to the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! My father has married me to a man that I dislike, in order to raise his own status.&#8221; So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, nullified her marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it is not permissible for a girl’s guardian to force her into marriage, regardless if she is a girl who has reached the legitimate age (of marriage) or she is divorced or she was married and then lost her husband. Rather it is only required of him to direct her towards what is most beneficial for her in her affairs of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no marriage except with (the permission of) a guardian and (the presence of) two trustworthy witnesses.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, also said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not force your women (to get married), but rather get their consent.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Her silence is her consent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are etiquettes and conditions that must be adhered to. However, at times there occurs something that opposes the Divine Legislation, such as when the father prevents his daughter and delays her marriage because of a materialistic ambition. Or because the man proposing marriage to her is poor, and due to this, his status will not be elevated. And so the girl remains without a husband. In this situation, the Divine Legislation has permitted her to marry herself because the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman that marries herself without the permission of her guardian, then her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. But if they differ, then the authoritative figure (sultaan) is the guardian of one who has no guardian.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this girl – whose father has prevented her marriage due to an obvious materialistic reason – she can take her case to a legitimate judge. So he will investigate the guardian of the girl&#8217;s affairs and interrogate him as to the reason why he is preventing her (from getting married). So if he hears a legitimate reason from him, such as that the man intending marriage is an innovator or he doesn&#8217;t pray or that he drinks alcohol, then the judge cannot oppose him in this. But if he hears illegitimate reasons from him, then at that point, the judge can assume guardianship of her marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling concerning putting limitations to the amount of offspring one has?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The person that limits his offspring without having a legitimate reason for doing so, I hold him to be <strong>foolish</strong> if not a disbeliever in the Qadaa and the Qadar (Divine Execution and Preordainment) of Allaah. This is since the individual that limits his progeny to only three children, for example, and he has reached the age of fifty (!), the thought of death does not even cross his mind, or that some violent storm should come and take the lives of his three children, thus leaving him till the end of his life as if he were barren and without offspring. Therefore, those that put limits to the amount of children they have, they do not reflect upon the things that every Muslim reflects on. And it is Al-Qadar (Preordainment), which befalls the people in the way that He wants, not in the way that they want. So this practice that is done in current times, is a severe negligence and a clear deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the ruling on birth control differ from that of family limitation (of offspring)? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Birth control has some detail to it. Therefore, I say that this thing, which has come to be known as &#8220;birth control&#8221; is from that which the Muslims of today are being tested by in the lands of Islaam. However, there are cases from it, which must be referred back to the motive behind it. An example of this is when the motive for this birth control is based on a prescription from Muslim doctors who are advising the couple towards this so-called &#8220;birth control&#8221; to safeguard the health of the woman who has departed from her natural state due to her having delivered many children! So if a skilled Muslim doctor issues these instructions as a form of advice, then that becomes a legitimate excuse for (the allowance of) this birth control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example in which birth control is permissible. As for an example that is contrary to this one, then it is such as when the motive behind it is due to poverty (!) or because of bills, which is always on the minds of the disbelievers!! So you can see one of them say: &#8220;My wife and I are two. And I have two children!! And the fifth member of them is their dog!! So this monthly pay that we receive is just enough for us (to pay our bills), and that&#8217;s all [five]!&#8221; This is not permissible in Islaam because this motive emanates from the logic of the Days of Ignorance, which we were warned to avoid and stay away from. Such is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide you with sustenance as well as them.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ana’aam: 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially the case since the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muslims believe that the child comes with his sustenance (already) with him</strong></span>. This is because, before it comes out into this world, its sustenance is ordained for it while it is in the womb of its mother, as has been clarified to us in the Noble Sunnah. So this example of birth control, with this motive, is not permissible at all. As for the baseless and false reasons that some people have used to justify and allow it, then they have no place in the Religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the best way for women to give da&#8217;wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say to the women: “<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Remain in your homes</em></span>.” [Surah Ahzaab: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should not concern yourselves with da&#8217;wah. I reject the use of the word &#8220;da&#8217;wah&#8221; amongst the male youth by them making it seem like they are from the people of da&#8217;wah – as if the word da&#8217;wah has become the fashion of modern times. So every individual that knows something about the Religion becomes a Da&#8217;ee (caller to Islaam)! And this matter did not stop with the male youth until it was carried over to the female youth and housewives. And in many instances, they have begun to turn away from fulfilling the obligations of their households and their husbands and their children, turning away from these obligations towards something that is not obligatory upon them, such as establishing the da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The general rule concerning the woman is that she is to stay in her home. And it has not been legislated for her to leave it unless she has a dire need. This is based on the statement of the Prophet,sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: &#8220;And (praying in) their homes is better for them&#8221;, i.e. than the (congregational) prayer in the masjid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see a prevalent phenomenon amongst the women in that they go out often to the masjids in order to pray the congregational prayer, not to mention the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. In spite of this, their homes are better for them – unless there is a masjid in which the Imaam is a scholar who teaches those attending some aspects from the sciences of the Religion. So in this case, the woman could go out to pray in the masjid in order to listen to the knowledge. There is nothing preventing her from that. As for the woman preoccupying herself with the da&#8217;wah (!), then let her sit in her home and read from the books that her husband or brother or other male relatives provide for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is nothing preventing her from setting a day in which she calls the women to come to her house or she goes out to attend the house of one of them. That is better than a group of women going out (to her). One woman going out to a group of women is better for them than all of them going out to her. As for her moving about and traveling, perhaps traveling without a mahram, and she justifies that by claiming that she went out for the purpose of da&#8217;wah, then these are from the presentday innovations. And I do not specify the women only with that, rather, even some of the male youth speak excessively about the da&#8217;wah and yet they have very little knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[42] Question: What is the ruling concerning a woman cutting some of her hair?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: With regard to a woman cutting her hair, then one must look into the motive behind her doing it. So if a woman cuts her hair in imitation of the disbelieving or sinful women, then it is not permissible for her to cut it while having this intention. As for cutting only a small portion from her hair or cutting it in accordance to the desires of her husband, then I do not see anything preventing this from being done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim (no. 320) that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet&#8217;s wives used to cut their hair to the point that it would reach the earlobes.&#8221;</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[37] Question: There are some masjids in which the women pray below the actual masjid, such as in the basement or in an upper level (above the masjid). We are women who pray in these masjids, at times following the Imaam from a point where we are not able to see him nor the male followers. And sometimes there is a large empty space left over in the area of prayer for the men. Is our prayer valid if we cannot see the Imaam or any of the (male) followers, and while knowing that sometimes we enter the masjid and don&#8217;t know what rak&#8217;ah he is in. Is it allowed in this situation to follow (the Imaam) by (hearing) the raised voice only? And is it correct for us to follow the Imaam while we are on an upper or lower level knowing that at times there is ample room in the masjid (floor)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The answer is in two parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> is that the prayer and the mentioned scenario is valid so long as the women pray in the masjid, regardless of whether it is in the upper or lower level. And it is so long as they are able to hear the takbeers from the Imaam indicating the change in position, such as from standing to bowing to prostrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second part</strong> is that it is not proper for the women to pray like this unless the area for the men is filled with people and they (the women) cannot find a place behind the rows for them to pray in. In these circumstances, it is permissible for the women to pray in the upper or lower level of the masjid. But if this masjid, where the Imaam and the men behind him pray, has ample room left over, then it is not allowed for the women to go up to the upper level or down to the lower level where they won&#8217;t be able to see the movements of the Imaam or the movements of the men praying behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">The best rows for the men are their first ones and their worst (rows) are their last ones. And the best rows for women are their last ones and the worst (rows) are their first ones</span></em>&#8220;, he meant by it the same ground that the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and his Companions behind him used to pray on. The women were not in upper or lower levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The underlying reason for this is that the speakers at times can be low and at other times they are not working. So the prayer of the women who are following him from an upper or lower level, from which they cannot see the prayer of the Imaam or those behind him, is subject to becoming invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The prayer that is performed while on an upper or lower level is valid. However, it is not permissible to designate those places for prayer when there is enough room in the prayer place (musalla), such that the women are able to pray in the back of it. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A woman went to the hospital and the doctors aborted her four month old fetus, with the argument that the woman had German Measles or measles and if we did not abort it, it would have come out deformed or mentally disabled; what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am asked a lot regarding the likes of this situation, and we hold the opinion that you should not respond to these doctors, since their silent expression says: &lt;&lt;we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).’&gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been informed from more than one source that some women had been informed by some doctors the like of this information [of aborting fetuses], but they did not consent to aborting and to miscarrying, and the new-born was delivered naturally, so this confirms that it is nothing but as conjecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, every command is in the Hand of Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- He has the command and He creates everything, so it is not befitting that some doctors participate in the likes of these matters, of which the reality is hidden from all people. Perhaps some people research into some hidden matters more so than others, so it is not allowed to look into the unknown future for all the people, and no-one knows the unseen except Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a woman … perhaps gives birth to a fetus that is deformed or similar to a deformed child, or like it is said nowadays, that it is disabled etc. . . . so, in respect to us being Muslims believing in Allaah –Azza wa Jal-  and that He is al-Hakeem (The All-Wise) and al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) there is no fault in His creation. So this variance which we generally see between human beings whether it is in skin colour or in height or shortness in stature or in being males or females, or in health and safety, or regarding diseases and illness etc. then all of this is what al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) has pre-destined. Because the Lord –Azza wa Jal- wants to show His slaves that what they regard as good and ugly, then all of that according to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- is good. The way we look at the creation of Allaah – Azza wa Jal- is not the way the Creator Himself –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- views things, because &lt;&lt;there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-knowing and All-Seeing.&gt;&gt; [Shura:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this opportunity it is necessary for me to mention a hadeeth, which I regard as very great concerning this topic and an answer to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a  man from his Companions, walking wearing a long garment and it was trailing below his ankles, so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so, raise your garment since it is closer to piety and better to remain cleaner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah I am bow-legged.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So this person lengthened his garment so that he could cover up this deficiency as he had presumed, and he apologized for this reason for having lengthened his garment so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so – [the shaykh said: ‘and here is the main point’ ] – ‘All of Allaah’s creation is good. All of Allaah’s creation is good.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 1441]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why, what we see with our human physical eyes, has to be judged immediately that this is a deficient sight. We see, as is mentioned in an old Arabic proverb: ‘Not past his rabbit like nose’ (tip of his nose).  They used to say of old, ‘so and so does not see past his rabbit like nose’ (does not look further than the tip of his nose).  As for looking far ahead then no! In addition to this no matter how far a human being can see, no matter how very far, it is still a deficient sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion from the Companions of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>saw himself as defective due to being bow-legged and the disability which was in his calves, so he covered it up by lengthening his garment. Because if he raised his garment slightly then some of the disability would have become exposed, so the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> brought his attention to this. That what you see as a deficiency is not a deficiency because Allaah is the One Who created you like that, and this is not from your own doing. Just like Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said: &lt;&lt;This is the creation of Allaah. So show Me that which those (whom you worship), besides Him have created. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore this child, this fetus, if it is born naturally and it was disabled or was afflicted with an illness which the doctors previously had presumed, then this is the Will of Allaah which is the Destiny that Allaah made so that it can be a lesson for healthy people.  As it has been said: ‘Health is a crown placed upon the head of healthy people which none can see except a person who is ill.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a very great, noble prophetic instruction, which is: ‘Do not look at those above you but look at those below you, since it is more befitting that you do not belittle the blessings of Allaah upon you.’ [Saheeh Lighayrihi: ‘Saheeh Targheeb  wa Tarheeb 2233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps there is a person who has a beautiful form, however there are people who look at themselves and view themselves as ugly and they might say that this person really is beautiful.  So this is the variance in the creation and in beauty and it is the predestination of Allaah al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) al-Hakeem (The All-Wise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah created beauty He also created its opposite, as we have said that it is created for an Infinite Wisdom, we can express this with what has been said a very long time ago: ‘Opposites clarify each other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not for ugliness, beauty would not be known. If it was not for illness, health would not be known. If it was not for males there would not be females. If it was not for females there would not be males.  So all this creation that we see, that Allaah created the people upon, it is from the Wisdom of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- this is why it is not befitting to conform to the opinions of doctors concerning matters which have not yet entered the sphere of life, and when it comes into the sphere of life then comes the saying of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘O slaves of Allaah seek treatment, since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the hadeeth of Usamah bin Shareek <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, it was also narrated by another noble Companion and he is none other than Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>with an extra wording, he said: ‘Seek cure O slaves of Allaah since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure, whoever knew it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it, was ignorant of it.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 451]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing to hinder seeking cure later on, however there is a condition which needs to be taken into consideration, which is, that this seeking cure is due to a matter which the new-born is exposed to, i.e. that it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal, because Allaah –Azza wa Jal- mentions about the accursed Shaytan in the Noble Qur’aan, that the Shaytaan challenged the will of the Lord of the worlds –Azza wa Jal- in respect to Adam and his offspring saying: &lt;&lt; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa’:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and this has examples, very many examples.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Nawawee said in his explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars have said: the reason for the superiority of the mother is due to her becoming tired on your account, her compassion, her serving you, suffering hardship while being pregnant with you, then giving birth to you, then suckling you, then bringing you up, serving you, nursing you and other things.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’<br />
By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>529 </strong>– From Umaymah bint Ruqayqah who said: ‘I came to the Messenger of Allaah  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> along with the women, so that we could pledge an allegiance upon Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said: O Messenger of Allaah we pledge allegiance to you that we will not associate anything with Allaah, nor will we steal, nor commit <em>Zina</em>, nor kill our offspring, nor will we utter slander intentionally forging falsehood, nor will we disobey you in a good action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> added: ‘In that which you have capability and energy to do.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umaymah said: ‘Allaah and His Messenger are more merciful to us than us being merciful to our own selves. Now then, we want to give you, O Messenger of Allaah the oath of allegiance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘<strong>Indeed I do not shake hands with women</strong>, as for what I say for a hundred women is like what I say for one woman.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Malik (2/982/8), by an-Nisa’ee in ‘Ashaarat an-Nisa’ from his book ‘Sunnan al-Kubra’ (2/93/2), Ibn Hibban (14) and Ahmad (6/357). Narrated from Muhammad bin al-Munkadir from Umaymah bint Ruqayqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration collected by an-Nisa’ee in ‘al-Mujtaba’ (2/184), Tirmidhi (1/302), Ibn Majah (2874), Ahmad and al-Humaydi in his Musnad (341) by way of Sufyan bin Uayinah from Muhammad bin al-Munkadir with the same narration, except that al-Humaydi and Tirmidhi summarized the narration but they brought extra wording after the saying: ‘Now then we want to give you allegiance’ that Sufyan said: ‘It means: shake our hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the narration of Ahmad the wording is: ‘We said Messenger of Allaah will you not shake our hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi said: ‘The hadeeth is <em>Hasan Saheeh</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: ‘And its <em>Isnaad</em> is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Ishaaq followed them in the narration and said: Muhammad bin al-Munkadir narrated to me, the rest of the narration with extra wording at the end: ‘Umaymah said: ‘<strong>and the Messenger of Allaah </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong> did not shake the hand of even one woman amongst us</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and al-Hakim, (4/71) with a <em>Hasan Isnaad</em>.  This narration has a brief and similar supporting evidence from the hadeeth of ‘Asmaa bint Yazeed. It was collected by al-Humaydi (368), Ahmad (6/454,459), ad-Dulaabi in ‘al-Kuna’ (2/128), Ibn AbdulBarr in ‘at-Tamheed’ (3/24/1) and Abu Na’eem in ‘Akhbar Asbahaan’ (1/293) by way of Shahr bin Hoshab from ‘Asmaa.  And in the narration by Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Asmaa asked the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: will you not put your hand out for us O Messenger of Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to her: ‘Indeed I do not shake hands with women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator ‘Shahr’ is weak in regards his memory, and by this extra wording, it is perceived that the women used to take the hand of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when giving allegiance, with a garment covering his <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are some other narrations which mention this, however they are all <em>Maraseel</em>(A type of hadeeth which is weak, were a Tabia’ee narrates from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> thereby being a break in the chain), which al-Hafidh mentioned in ‘al-Fath’ (8/488) so none of them can be used as an evidence especially since they oppose that which is more authentic than these narrations, like the main hadeeth under discussion and that which comes after it, likewise the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha concerning when the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would take the allegiance from women and she mentions that: ‘And no, <strong>I swear by Allaah the hand of the Messenger </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong> never ever touched a woman</strong>when they would give him allegiance, except that he would say: ‘I have taken your allegiance upon that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by al-Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the statement of Umm ‘Atteeya <em>–Radhiallaahu anha-</em> : ‘We gave allegiance to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and he recited to us &lt;&lt;that they should not associate anything along with Allaah&gt;&gt; and he forbade us from wailing at a death, so a woman withdrew her hand, she said: such and such woman helped me lament. . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth has been collected by Bukhari and this is not as apparent as it may seem that the women would shake the Messenger’s hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the like of this narration cannot refute the clear text from the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘I do not shake hands with women.’ Also his action which was narrated by Umaymah bint Raqeeaa, Aeysha and Ibn Umar as we will mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said: ‘It is as if ‘Aeysha indicated to this, refuting that which came from Umm ‘Atteeya, from what Ibn Khuzaima collected and Ibn Hibban, al-Bazzar, at-Tabari and Ibn Mardaway from way of Isma’eel bin AbdurRahman from his grandmother Umm ‘Atteeya regarding the story of giving allegiance.  He said: the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stretched out his hand from outside the house and then we [the women] stretched out our hands from inside the house. Then the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘O Allaah bear witness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in the hadeeth which comes after this where she said: ‘A woman from amongst us held her hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed one feels that they would give allegiance with their hands. And it is possible to reply to the first hadeeth that stretching out the hand from behind the <em>Hijaab</em> indicates that allegiance was taken even though the shaking of hands did not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second narration then the meaning of holding/clutching the hand was the delay in submitting allegiance, or that allegiance took place with a garment placed upon the hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Daawood narrated in ‘al-Maraseel’ from ash-Sha’abee that when the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> took an allegiance from the women who came, using a garment from Qatar and he placed it on his hand and said: I do not shake hands with women….’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Hafidh mentioned the rest of the Ahadeeth in meaning and they are all ‘Maraseel’ and cannot be used as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What he (al-Hafidh) mentioned in reply to the two Ahadeeth of Umm ‘Atteeyah, then that is the main proof that her hadeeth are from Isma’eel bin AbdurRahman and he is not a strong narrator, because this Isma’eel is not well-known rather he is used as a supporting narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, it is not authentic from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he ever shook hands with a woman, not even while taking allegiance, more over so shaking hands when meeting each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some people use as an evidence for its permissibility by using the hadeeth of Umm ‘Atteeyah which she mentioned, even though shaking hands is not mentioned. Likewise they turn away from the clear Ahadeeth where the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> refrained from shaking hands, and this is something which does not stem from a sincere believer, especially since there is a severe warning for the one who touches a woman who it is not lawful to touch as is in hadeeth no. 226 [ From the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> : ‘That it is better for a person to be struck on his head with an iron rod than touch a woman whom he is not allowed to touch.’ (See the Shaykh’s comment about this hadeeth at the end of this article.)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a supporting hadeeth for the hadeeth of Umayma bint Ruqayqah  which will follow shortly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After I wrote what has preceded, I saw that Ishaaq bin Mansoor al-Marwazi said in the book ‘Mas’ail Ahmad wa Ishaaq’ (1/211): ‘I said (to Ahmad): Do you dislike to shake hands with women?’ He answered: ‘I dislike it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaaq said: ‘It is as he said it, whether it is an old lady or a young lady, indeed the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> took their allegiance while he had a garment covering his hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I saw in ‘al-Mustadrak’ (2/486) from Ism’aeel bin Abee Owais who said that his brother narrated to him from Sulayman bin Bilal from Ibn ‘Ajlaan from his father from Fatima bint ‘Utbah bin Rabee’ah bin Abd-Shams. ‘That Abu Hudayfah bin ‘Utbah <em>–Radhiallaahu anhu-</em> came with her (Fatima bint ‘Utbah) and Hind bint ‘Utbah to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> to give allegiance to him. She said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He took allegiance from us and he placed conditions upon us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She narrates that she said to him: O my uncle’s son did you ever know of any evil and sickness whatsoever about your people?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hudayfah said: ‘Yes we will give him allegiance, and indeed this is what the allegiance was given about and this is its condition.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima said that Hind said: ‘I do not give allegiance to you upon not stealing rather I steal from my husband’s wealth, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> put out his hand and she put out her hand. Then he sent a message to Abu Sufyan and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> made it permissible for her to take from him. Abu Sufyan said: ‘As for food stuff then she can take it, as for wealth then no and made <em>Dua’</em>against her!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: ‘So we gave allegiance to him then Fatima said: ‘There was no person more hateful to me than yourself and I did not like that Allaah make it permissible for you to have authority and what it contains.  And now I swear by Allaah that there is no person more beloved to me than your person and that Allaah lengthens it and blesses it and gives recompense.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Likewise, I swear by Allaah none of you truly believes until I become more beloved to you than your son and your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim said: Saheeh al-Isnaaad and Dhahabee agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) said: ‘Its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Hasan</em> because there is some talk about Muhammad bin Ajlaan and Isma’eel bin Abee Owais but it is not harmful <em>Inshallaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth supports the point that allegiance took place between the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>and the women by stretching out their hands without actually shaking hands, as was previously mentioned by al-Hafidh, since if it did take place the narrator would have mentioned it, as is apparent. So there is no difference between this hadeeth and the main hadeeth under discussion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.2  hadeeth no.529  p.63-67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Hadeeth No. 530</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abdullaah bin Amr’: ‘that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em><strong>never used to shake hands with women</strong> in taking allegiance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad, Albaani said its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Hasan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol. 2  hadeeth no.530  p.67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Hadeeth no. 226</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ma’aqal bin Yassar from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> : ‘That it is better for a person to be struck on his head with an iron rod than touch a woman whom he is not allowed to touch.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by ar-Rooyaani in his ‘Musnad’ Albani said the <em>Isnaad</em> is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth is a severe warning to the one who touches a woman who it is not allowed for him to touch. In this hadeeth is an evidence that it is prohibited to shake hands with women because no doubt shaking hands includes touching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of the Muslims nowadays have been trialed by this and amongst them some of the people of knowledge, even if some of them showed disapproval in their hearts then the situation would have become minimized a little.  However<strong>, </strong>they try to regard it as permissible by using many different techniques and interpretations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It reached us that a very big personality in al-Azhar (University in Egypt) was seen by some people shaking hands with women. Our complaint is to Allaah about the absence of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed some of the Islamic groups have taken the opinion that it is permissible to shake hands between men and women, and it was made binding upon every <em>Hizbi</em>(partisan) to implement it, and they use as an evidence for that, with that which is not correct, rejecting what is considered from the hadeeth, and there are other clear Ahadeeth which show the impermissibility of shaking hands between men and women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.1  hadeeth no.226]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken from &#8216;Silsilah ahadeeth ad-Daeefah’ 2/880</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">A summary of the research by the Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> revealed miracles as an evidence against the people. One of the great miracles which Allaah showed the people was of the three who spoke in the cradle. This has been authentically narrated without a shadow of doubt. It was collected, authentically by the two great scholars of hadeeth, Imaam Bukhari and Imaam Muslim in their authentic books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following narration is the authentic one:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Huraira <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said, “None spoke in cradle but three: (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), ‘Shall I answer her or keep on praying?” (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his mother said, “O Allaah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said, ‘O child! Who is your father?’ The child replied, ‘The shepherd.’ (After hearing this) the people said, ‘We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,’ but he said, ‘No, of nothing but mud.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The third was the hero of the following story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, ‘O Allaah ! Make my child like him.’ On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, ‘O Allaah! Do not make me like him.’ The child then started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, “As if I were now looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.”) After a while the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child’s mother) said, ‘O Allaah! Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said, ‘O Allaah! Make me like her.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When she asked why, the child replied, ‘The rider is one of the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual intercourse.” Authentically reported in Saheeh al-Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the story of the hairdresser of the daughter of Pharaoh, which is not authentic, but it is weak (<em>Da’eef</em>) is narrated as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[ It was narrated that Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: On the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey, a beautiful fragrance came to me. I said: O Jibreel, what is this beautiful fragrance? He said: This is the fragrance of the hairdresser of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter and her children. I said: What is their story? He said: Whilst she was combing the hair of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter one day, the iron comb fell from her hand and she said, <em>Bismillaah</em> (in the name of Allaah). The daughter of Pharaoh said: You mean my father? She said: No. My Lord and the Lord of your father is Allaah. She said: I will tell him about that. She said: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she told him and he summoned her and said: O So and so, do you have a Lord other than me? She said: Yes, my Lord and your Lord is Allaah. He ordered that a cow made of copper be heated up, then he ordered that she and her children be thrown into it. She said: I have a request to make of you. He said: What is your request? She said: I would like my bones and my children&#8217;s bones to be gathered together in one cloth and buried. He said: This will be done for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ordered that her children be thrown into it in front of her, one by one, until they came to the last one who was an infant boy who was still being breastfed. It was as if she wavered because of him, but he said: O mother, go ahead, for the punishment of this world is easier to bear than the punishment of the hereafter. So she went ahead. Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: Four infants spoke: Eesa ibn Maryam <em>-alayhi Sallam</em>, the companion of Jurayj, the witness of Yoosuf and the son of the hairdresser of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Ibn Abbas and collected by Imaam Ahmad in his ‘Musnad’ and Hakim in ‘al-Mustadrak’. Ad-Dhahabi and Ibn Katheer had authenticated it. And from the contemporary scholars, the likes of Ahmad Shaakir and al-Arnaoot have also followed them and authenticated this story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Muhadith</em> of Sham, Shaykh Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani disputes their claim. The Shaykh discusses this narration in his amazing work entitled ‘Silsilah ahadeeth ad-Daeefah’. He says that this wording is <em>Batil</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of his research:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-The hadeeth of Hakim has two narrators in its <em>isnaad</em> who do not have biographies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The Shaykh said it is <em>batil</em> for two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The narration firstly mentions there were three who spoke in the cradle, but then mentions the names of four individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) This narration is different to the wording in the authentic hadeeth of Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- All the other narrations have defects in their <em>Asaneed</em>. Here the Shaykh begins to discuss a lot of technical detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- The Shaykh said: ‘I did not find any authentic hadeeth which negates the number of babies who spoke in cradle are mentioned in the hadeeth of Bukhari and Muslim. Except what is in the story of the boy of the people of the ditch, where he said to his mother, ‘o mother be patient, since indeed you are upon the truth.’ as narrated by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- The Shaykh continues later on by saying: ‘then, what is apparent in the Qur’aan from the story of the witness to what happened to Prophet Yusuf <em>-alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> is that the witness was a man not a baby child in the cradle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it had been a baby then just the baby saying that she is a liar would be sufficient as absolute evidence, since it would have been a miracle. There would be no need for saying &lt;&lt;and a witness of her household bore witness&gt;&gt;, nor any need for living proof of the innocence of Yusuf <em>-alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> which is the saying from the verse. &lt;&lt;If it be that his shirt is torn from the front, then her tale is true and he is a liar! But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back….. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer narrates an <em>isnaad</em> where all the narrators are trustworthy on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the person who witnessed what happened to Prophet was a man who had a beard, and this the stronger opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- The Shaykh mentions:<br />
(benefit): what has been mentioned in some <em>Tafseer</em> books and other than them, that from those who also spoke in the cradle were Ibraheem, Yahya and Muhammad <em>-alayhim as-Sallam ajmaeen-</em> there is nothing narrated from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is what you should know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one requires more detailed information then they can refer to ‘Silsilah ahadeeth ad-Daeefah’ 2/880</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> We know that a woman&#8217;s dancing in front of her husband, and likewise her dancing with women, which is swaying, and the <i>dabkah</i> [1] of men are forbidden, but what is the proof for that? Please provide us with some insight on this, may Allaah reward you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> This question consists of three parts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: A woman dancing in front of her husband<br />
Second: Her dancing in front of other women<br />
Third: The <i>dabkah</i> performed by men</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first part, which is a woman&#8217;s dancing in front of her husband. If her dancing is natural and not professional – meaning that she learned how to dance, as is the fashion of this time – even if she stirs the desires of the man, then there is no text that can be found that forbids this. But this is on the condition that it occurs between her and her husband only. As for the case where she has learned to dance and she applies the principles of modern-day dancing, then this is not permissible. This is because I believe that if she will do that in front of her husband, then she will surely also do it in front of other men besides her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for her dancing in front of other women, then I also say that if her objective in dancing is to dance this modern style of dancing, then it is clear that it is not permissible. And if it is said: &#8220;What is the proof for what you have stated?&#8221; I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moderation in matters is very rare; there is either excessiveness or there is negligence. This is especially the case with people who have lived a long period of time in deviation of a specific nature. Then when it becomes clarified to them that this matter was a deviation and that the Religion rejects it, they turn away from it and introduce in place of that, a severe reaction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what has befallen us in this present time with regard to the issue of demanding the proof in place of the liberation from blind following. The Muslims, both special and common people, have lived long generations not knowing anything but the madh-hab of so and so and the madh-hab of so and so – four madh-habs, the madh-habs of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. And this is not to mention the other madh-habs, those that have deviated from the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah. As for relying on what Allaah and his Messenger, <i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, said for support, then this was only found in the generations that have received testimony of their excellence. Then that affair came to an end for a point in time until there came the time of Ibn Taimiyyah and those of his students who were devoted to him. So they informed the Muslims of the obligation of returning back to what the first Salaf (predecessors) were upon, such as relying on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah for support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the Call of Ibn Taimiyyah and his students had a positive effect. However, its scope was very weak during his time and intellectual impassiveness (i.e. not reflecting on proofs) took over and became dominant amongst the special classes of people, not to mention the common ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there followed succeeding generations in which this re-awakening that Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah ignited died out. And the Muslims turned back to their indifference of comprehending and understanding (i.e. the evidences), until this present time and a brief period before it, for many scholars rose to take charge of the Da&#8217;wah&#8217;s revival, due to the need of returning to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. They were preceded in some of that by Shaikh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Wahhaab, for in reality, he called to the following of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. But looking at the areas in which the Arabs of Najd during Shaikh Muhammad&#8217;s land used to live in, and considering the paganism that took place in their lands, his greatest effort was in showing strong concern for Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as is very natural, in my opinion, such that mankind&#8217;s ability is limited, he was not able to wage his war on every front, as they say. So because of this, all of his efforts were geared towards spreading the call of Tawheed and waging war against paganism and idolatry. And he received all the success in that and his splendid Call was spread all over the Islaamic world afterwards. And this was even though, unfortunately, there occurred fighting between him and his opponents. But this is the Sunnah (Way) of Allaah with regard to His creation. And you will not find any change in the Sunnah (Way) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, in current times, the scholars have renewed their call to the Book and the Sunnah and thus many of the common and special people in the Arab lands have re-awakened. As for the non-Arab lands, then unfortunately they are still in a state of sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Arab lands have been tested by a reversal, which is what I have indicated previously, such that some of them do not stop at the middle point of moderation. Instead they know of one thing and are ignorant of another thing. So you will see the common man who doesn&#8217;t understand anything, when he asks the scholar on any subject &#8220;What is its ruling?&#8221;, regardless of whether the answer is a denial and a negation, he begins with his demand: &#8220;What is the proof?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sometimes that scholar is not able to establish the proof, especially if the proof is deduced and adopted through thorough research, and it is not stated in a specific text in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. So in issues of this nature, it is not proper for the questioner to go deep and say: &#8220;What is the proof?&#8221; And it is required that the questioner know himself. Is he from the people that understand evidences or not? Does he have any share in knowledge of the general (&#8216;aam) and the specific (<i>khaas</i>), the unrestricted (<i>mutlaq</i>) and the restricted (<i>muqayyad</i>), the abrogating (<i>naasikh</i>) and the abrogated (<i>mansookh</i>). So if the person does not understand any of these things, then does he get any benefit from saying: &#8220;What is the proof&#8221;?! For what?! – For the ruling on a woman dancing in front of her husband or her dancing in front of her Muslim sister, whether it is either permissible or forbidden! And the dabkah of men! He wants the proof for that! But in reality, there is no textual proof from the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, on that matter that exists for us. There is only investigation, deduction and the acquisition of understanding for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, we say at certain times: Not every issue has an explicit proof that can be presented in detail, which every Muslim can understand, whether he is a common unlettered person or a student of knowledge. But this is not for all the issues. This is why Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>&#8220;Ask the people of knowledge if you don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the extremism that we indicated previously – and due to it, the most ignorant of people has begun to decline the proof – is that many of those who attribute themselves to the Book and the Sunnah. They believe that the scholar, when he is asked on an issue, it is obligatory upon him to link &#8220;Allaah said and His Messenger <i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said&#8221; with his answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that this is not an obligation, and that it is from the benefits of belonging to the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors). And furthermore, their biographies and their fataawaa (religious verdicts) is a proof in action for what I have stated. So based on this, mentioning the proof is obligatory when the situation necessitates it, however it is not an obligation on him every time he is asked a question to say: &#8220;Allaah says such and such&#8221; or &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said such and such.&#8221; And this is especially if the issues are from the detailed and intricate issues of Fiqh in which there are differences of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Ask the people of knowledge if you don&#8217;t know&#8221;</b> is first of all in the unrestricted sense, so all you have to do is ask someone whom you feel is from the people of knowledge. And when you hear the answer from him, then it is upon you to follow it, unless you have a doubt about it due to what you heard from another scholar. There is no harm in you mentioning that to him. So at that point, the scholar must make an effort, with the knowledge he has, to remove this doubt presented by the questioner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: A woman dancing in front of her husband, along with the condition mentioned previously, is permissible. As for her dancing in front of other women, then it has two forms also, as we have stated before. With regard to a woman dancing in front of her husband, then if her dancing is not joined with professionalism, but rather it is just a moving and waving of hands. And there is no shaking of ones hips or those sorts of things that stir the desires, then there is also no problem with this dancing. If it is correct to call it dancing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if any of those (evil) things mentioned above are found in it, then refraining from it is the original principle. As for the <i>dabkah</i> of men, then if it is in imitation of the dances, which we see are normally joined with singing, not to mention that there are words mentioned in it that are not from the Religion, then this is lahw (vain pastime) and it is not encouraged. Rather, it is encouraged to stay away from it, as the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Every lahw (vain pastime) the Son of Adam engages in is falsehood, except his playing with his wife, his playing with his horse, archery and learning to swim.&#8221;</b> So due to this hadeeth, we hold the opinion that it is falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is the condition of the pure vain pastime in that we are encouraged to refrain from it and that is not from the truthful matters, then we say that it allowable, so long as is not accompanied with something that opposes the Religion. However, it is an allowance that must be weighed by the hadeeth that I have mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in my opinion, and Allaah knows best for I have not witnessed any of these dabkahs, it is not possible for it to be free from any opposition to the Religion. And this is because, for example, we have heard the dabkah at times, and it is not just it alone. Rather, we hear along with it, music, the mu&#8217;adhdhin calling the Adhaan and the Imaam reciting the Qur&#8217;aan out loud. And they do not care about anything else but instead they are busy with their vain pastime. Therefore, the dabkah is from the vain pastimes that must be weighed and determined. And we do not say that it is Haraam (forbidden) unless it is combined with something that goes against the Religion from one of the aspects, for then it would turn without a doubt into something Haraam (forbidden).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The family is that brick which forms the foundation of a society. It is composed of individuals that have permanent relations established between them. Most importantly, it possesses almost a majority of the different kinds of personal relations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, there must be certain etiquettes placed in order to control and regulate these relations. This is such that it can be maintained in the best possible manner, and so that it can generate and produce its proper fruits. Family relations consist of the relationship between the spouses from one perspective, the relationship between the parents and the children from a second perspective, and the relationship between the children themselves from a third perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Etiquettes of the husband:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is not from the deficiencies, but rather from good manners, that the husband shares in the responsibility of specified matters, such as the mending of garments or what is similar to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is appropriate for a man to not restrict himself from serving himself. This is since the wife takes care of the household affairs. So therefore, it is from good manners that the husband extend a helping hand to his wife in the house, during times of necessity, such as when she is sick, pregnant, has given birth or similar to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The exemplary husband is he who cooperates with his wife by bearing good relations and showing kind manners (to her), according to the full extent of the meaning contained in these (last) two expressions. Truly, the husbands who are best at working alongside their wives are the best of mankind in the view of Islaam. This good way of living between the spouses must be deeply imbedded into the daily marital life, even at the time of divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Beware of characterizing the relationship between the spouses with over-seriousness! For indeed characterizing the family life with a militaristic nature amounts to one of the causes for failure and bad results.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. From the kind and noble manners of the husband is that he complies and assents to the requests of his wife, so long as they are not forbidden in the Religion. And being luxurious in food, drink and clothing is at the entrance of matters forbidden in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The husband should specify a time in which he can play around and pass free time with his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The relationship between the spouses must contain one singular and specific nature. And it cannot be this way unless the couple begins demolishing all the obstacles and impediments that stand between them. For example, the husband should not feel timid and restrain himself from drinking out of the same cup that his wife drinks out of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. There is no human being that is perfect. So there is no doubt that the husband will see things in his wife that does not comply with his natural disposition and preferences. If these aspects are not in opposition to the fundaments of the Religion or to the obedience of the husband and his rights, then at that point, he should not try to change her personality so that it complies with his natural preference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. And he must always remember that for each member of the couple, there will be an aspect of ones personality that conflicts with the others personality. And he should also remember that if there are some characteristics that he doesn&#8217;t find pleasing in his wife, then indeed she has other characteristics, which will definitely be pleasing to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Do not let Ramadaan be a barrier that impedes you from showing affection to your wife, such as by kissing her. But this is so long as you are able to refrain yourself, since what is forbidden during the days of Ramadaan is only sexual intercourse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Do not chase after the errors of your wife and recount them to her, for too much blaming and reprimanding will worsen the relationship between the two of you, and it will pose a threat to your marital life. So overlook your wife&#8217;s easy ability to make mistakes, and make her falling into them seem like something small.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If you are able, do not hold back from providing your wife with good clothing and food, and from being generous in spending money on her. This is of course according to the extent of your ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Do not give little importance to implementing the punishment required for any acts in opposition to the Religion, which your wife has committed, whether it is in the home or outside it. This should be the main reason that causes you to become angry, thus no other reason should affect you (besides this one).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. What has been stated previously does not mean that you should leave matters alone until that result comes to happen. Thus, whenever you realize that a matter is left alone, weigh it with seriousness and determination, without being too harsh or rude about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. The woman is the head of the household, the one responsible for it. So do not attempt to meddle into affairs that do not fall into your area of duties and responsibilities, such as the food and the order of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Beware of scolding your wife or blaming her for a mistake she committed, in the presence of others, even if they are your own children. For indeed that is an act that goes against correct behavior and it will lead to raising anger in the hearts of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. If you are forced to place punishment upon your wife, then let it be by staying away from her at bedtime. And do not boycott her except that it is done within the household. And avoid using foul language, insulting her, beating her and describing her with repulsive names. For these matters do not befit an exemplary husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. Having jealousy and caring about the modesty of your wife is a praiseworthy thing, which shows your love for her. However it is on the condition that you do not go to great extremes in this jealousy. For then at that point, it would turn into something worthy of no praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. Entering the house: Do not alarm your family by entering upon them suddenly. Rather, enter while they are aware of it, and greet them with Salaam. And ask about them and how they are doing. And do not forget to remember Allaah, the Mighty and Sublime, when you enter the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Beware of spreading any secrets connected with the intimate encounters you have with your wife, for that is something restricted and forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Constantly maintain the cleaning of your mouth and the freshening of your breath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Guardianship of your wife doesn&#8217;t mean that you can exploit what Allaah has bestowed upon you from taking charge of her, such that you harm and oppress her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Showing respect and kindness to your wife&#8217;s family is showing respect and kindness to her. And this applies even after her death, on the condition that it is not accompanied by an act forbidden in the Religion, such as intermingling of the sexes or being in privacy (with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Too much joking will lead to (your family having) little fear (of disobeying you) and a lack of respect for you. So do not joke too much with your wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Be considerate that fulfilling the conditions which you promised to your wife during the pre-marriage agreement is a matter possessing the highest of importance and priority. So do not neglect that after getting married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. When you lecture your wife or reprimand her or simply speak to her, choose the kindest and nicest of words and expressions for your speech. And do not reprimand her in front of others or in front of your children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is not proper for you to ask your wife to look for work outside of the house or to spend upon you from her wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Do not overburden your wife with acts that she is not able to handle. Consider, with extreme regard, the environment she was raised up in. Rural service is not like urban service, and the service of a strong woman and her preparation for it is not like the service of a weak woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. There is nothing in the obligation of a woman&#8217;s service to her husband that negates his assisting her in that regard, if he should find the free time. Rather, this is from the good manners of living between the spouses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This discussion will continue in an upcoming issue, if Allaah wills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: His book “Tanbeehaat ‘alaa Ahkaam takhtassu bil-Mu’minaat” (pg. 97-99)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on you O Muslim woman to obey your husband in matters of good. Abu Hurairah reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If a woman prays her five (daily) prayers and keeps her private parts chaste and obeys her husband, she will enter Paradise from any of the doors of Paradise she wishes.”</b> [Reported by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“It is not lawful for a woman to fast while her husband is present unless she has his permission. And she must not allow anyone in his home except with his permission.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come to him, and he spends the night angry with her, the angels curse her until the morning arrives.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the report of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“By the One in whose Hand my soul is, there is no man that calls his wife to bed and she refuses him, except that the One who is above the heavens is displeased with her until he (the husband) becomes content with her.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the rights the husband possesses over his wife is that she fulfills the duty of tending to his household and not coming out from it except with his permission. The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“The woman is the caretaker of her husband’s household and she will be questioned as to her responsibility.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another right he possesses over her is that she fulfills the duties of the household and that she does not make him hire a female servant, which will cause harm and due to which there will be a risk of danger for himself and his children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said commenting on Allaah’s saying: <b>“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (i.e. their chastity).”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34]: “This mandates the unrestricted obligation of a woman obeying her husband, in all affairs, such as serving him, traveling with him, assisting him and other matters, as is indicated in the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Ibn Al-Qayyim, said: “Those who say that it is obligatory for the woman to serve the husband use (this ayah) as proof in that those who Allaah directed His Speech to (on this occasion) considered this to be from <i>al-ma’roof</i> (good). But as for the woman relaxing and having the husband serve her, sweep, grind the flour, knead the bread, wash the clothes, fix the bed, and serve the household, then that is from <i>al-munkar</i> (evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>‘And they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar to those (of their husbands) over them.’</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 228]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>‘Men are the protectors and maintainers over women.’</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a woman doesn’t serve her husband, but instead he acts like a servant to her, then this means that she is the protector and maintainer over him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: “For indeed Allaah obligated him to spend on her, to clothe her and to provide her with a place of dwelling in exchange for his enjoying her and her serving him, as well as what the habits of the spouses call for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the binding marriage agreements require that the spouses live in kindness. And kindness means a woman’s serving (her husband) and taking care of the inner affairs of the household.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: “And there is no difference as to whether the woman is prestigious or lowly, or if she is poor or rich. Just look at this woman who was the most prestigious of women in the world…” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is referring to Faatimah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhaa</i>) for she would serve her husband and come to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) complaining to him, but he would not complain about her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Qu</strong><span class="bodytext"><b>estion:</b> “It has become very common amongst us in these days, when a man goes away on a journey and then returns, a group of women from his “group” come to him and greet him and kiss him and so on, during the days of ‘Eid, such as ‘Eid-ul-Fitr and ‘Eid-ul-Adhaa. Is this permissible?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> It is well known from evidences in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah,[1] that a woman must not shake hands with or kiss a male that is not a mahram to her, whether it is an occasion of celebration or when arriving from a journey or for any other reason. This is because the woman is <i>‘awrah</i> (i.e. she must be covered) and a <i>fitnah</i> (i.e. a source of temptation). So she must not touch a man that is not considered a mahram [2] to her, regardless if it is her cousin or someone distant from her. And she must not kiss him or he kiss her.</p>
<div class="dropcap" style="text-align:justify;">
<p>We do not know of there being any difference of opinion amongst the scholars regarding the prohibition and rejection of this matter. This is because it is from the things that cause fitnah (trials and tests) and it is from the means that lead to what Allah has forbidden from the lewd and shameless acts and the customs that oppose the Divine Legislation. It is not permissible for the Muslims to remain upon these customs and to stay attached to them. Rather they must abandon them and fight against them. And they should give thanks to Allaah for having blessed them with knowledge of His Laws and for enabling him to abandon what angers Him.</p>
<p>Allaah sent the Messengers – at the head of whom was our prophet Muhammad – to call the people to single Allaah out in worship and to obey His commandments, and to abandon what He forbade and to fight against the evil practices (of old).</p>
<p>So it is obligatory to abandon such a practice (of shaking hands). And it is sufficient to give the greetings with speech, without touching or kissing. And there is much sufficiency in what Allaah has legislated and permitted for us over what He forbade and disallowed. Also, the greeting must be done while the woman is wearing the Hijaab, especially with the young females, because uncovering the face is not allowed. This is due to it being from the greatest part of a woman’s beauty that Allaah has forbidden her to expose, where He says: <b>“And let them not expose their beauty, except to their husbands or their fathers or their husbands’ fathers…”</b> [Surah An-Noor: 31]</p>
<p>And Allaah says in Surah Al-Ahzaab:<br />
<b>“And if you ask them concerning a matter, then ask them from behind a veil (Hijaab). That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts.”</b> [Surah Ahzaab: 53]</p>
<p>And He says: <b>“Say to your wives and your daughters and the believing women to let them draw (from) their jilbaabs, (placing it down) all over themselves. That is better that they be known (as free women), and so that they won’t be molested. And Allaah is All-Forgiving, the Bestower of Mercy.”</b> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 59]</p>
<p>And He says: <b>“And the <i>Qawaa’id</i> (old women past age of child-bearing), who do not expect wedlock, there is no sin on them if they discard (i.e. take off) their (outer) garments, without doing so in a manner so as to show off their adornment immorally (tabbaruj). But if they refrain from doing that, this is better for them. And Allaah is the All-Hearer, All-Knower.”</b> [Surah An-Noor: 60]</p>
<p>The <b><i>“Qawaa’id”</i></b> here refers to old barren women. Allaah explains that there is no sin on them if they decide to remove their outer garments from off their faces and such, so long as they do not do it in a manner in which they would be exposing their beauty wrongly. But continuing to wear the veil is better for them, due to what it offers from distancing her away from fitnah.</p>
<p>And if they are going to expose their beauty wrongly, then they must not take off their outer garment, but instead continue to veil, even if they are old barren women.</p>
<p>So from all of this, we come to know that the young women are obligated to wear the Hijaab, by way of the veil, in all situations, whether they would be exposing themselves improperly or not. This is because the fitnah that can be caused by them and the danger of their unveiling is greater.</p>
<p>And since Allaah has forbidden the women from unveiling, then forbiddance of touching and kissing (male strangers) takes greater precedence. So it is an obligation to abandon all of this and warn against it, and to advise one another to abandon it. May Allaah direct all of us to what pleases Him and protect us from the things that bring about His Anger. Verily, He is the Most Magnanimous, Most Generous.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the <strong>Al-Ibaanah</strong> publication: &#8220;Raising Children in Light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah&#8221; by ‘Abdus-Salaam As-Sulaymaan. The book was introduced and commended by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10. Breastfeeding:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward, the mother should focus on breastfeeding the newborn child until the age of weaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Natural milk from the mother has a huge effect in the health and upbringing of a child.<strong>Allah instructs the mothers to breastfeed their children for two complete years.</strong>This is for those wish to complete the period of breastfeeding. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ ۖ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ ۚوَعَلَى الْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚلَا تُضَارَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ ۚ وَعَلَى الْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذَ‌ٰلِكَ ۗ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالًا عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا ۗ وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّا آتَيْتُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۗوَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Baqarah: 233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is because the infant senses the affection of the mother while breastfeeding and he is in need of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Modern medicine has confirmed that there is a high percentage rate of disease and death for those children that were fed in their infancy with processed milk. Natural milk is also advantageous to the mother’s health in terms of mending the uterus after delivery and her digestive system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam also encourages it for it permits the breastfeeding mother to break her fast in Ramadhan if the fast will have an effect on her breastfeeding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps one of the reasons why many children are not affectionately attached to their mothers and why there is such widespread disobedience of them in these times is due to the lack of using natural milk and the high use of processed milk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since breastfeeding has such an effect on the child being breastfed, <strong>the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) prohibited Muslims from employing a dumb woman for the purposing of breastfeeding one’s child.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qaasim, may Allah have mercy on him, said in <em>Haashiyat-ur-Rawd</em> commenting on this hadeeth: <em><strong>“This is since breastfeeding has an effect on an individual’s nature.”</strong></em>Then he said: <em><strong>“Al-Qaadee mentioned that whoever is breastfed from a stupid woman, the child too will come out being stupid. And whoever is breastfed from a woman with bad manners, it will pass onto him. And whoever is breastfed from an animal, he will come out senseless, like an animal.”</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said in <em>al-Mughnee</em>: “It is said:<em><strong>‘Breastfeeding changes personalities.’</strong></em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how much more so for those who are fed formula milk which one does not even know the source from where it came or who processed it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan</strong> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“What is your advice to the male guardians of certain women that are lax when it comes to the issue of the Hijaab and who are engrossed in exposing their alluring bodily features to male-strangers in the markets and other places? What is the role of a woman’s male guardian in safeguarding her Religion?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So he replied: </strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah says: <b>‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allaah has favored some of them (i.e. men) over others (women).’</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34] Allaah has enabled and entrusted men to take care of and be responsible for women. And He commanded the women to obey Him and forbade them from disobeying Him. This includes the Hijaab.The Hijaab is one of Allaah’s commandments. So therefore it is an obligation on her male-guardian to require her to wear it, regardless is he is her direct male-guardian such as her father, son, brother or someone who has guardianship over her, or if he is the general guardian, such as the Muslim ruler who may mandate the Muslim women to wear the Hijaab.</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim ruler may oblige the women of his country to wear the Hijaab, in the general sense, while the male guardians in charge of households may oblige the women who live in their homes to wear the Hijaab (in the specific sense). They are responsible for these women. If the women knew that the general ruler in charge of her affairs as well as her specific male-guardian oblige her to obey Allaah and abandon disobeying Him, she would not put up any resistance in these matters. But when the male-guardians show laxity in these matters, the women become audacious. And there are callers to evil, lewdness, and hypocrisy behind them who encourage them to unveil and take off the Hijaab.</p>
<p>So the matter today is dangerous. It is incumbent upon a woman’s male guardians – both the general and the specific ones – to assist and aid one another in obliging the women to abide by the Hijaab. It is also an obligation upon the male guardians, may Allaah grant them correctness, to silence the tongues of those who invite to evil and corruption – those who call to unveiling and to the removal of the Hijaab. This is what Allaah has entrusted them with.”</p>

Prohibition of Mourning beyond Three Days (For Women)</h5>

Umm Habibah (May Allah be pleased with her) sent for a yellow coloured perfume or something else like it, and she applied it to a slave-girl and then rubbed it on her own cheeks and said: &#8220;By Allah, I have no need for perfume, I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying from the pulpit, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for the dead beyond three days, except for the death of her husband; in which case the period of mourning is of four months and ten days</span>.&#8221;&#8217; Zainab said: I then visited Zainab, daughter of Jahsh (May Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died; she sent for perfume and applied it and then said: &#8220;Beware!

Prohibition of Meeting a non-Mahram Woman in Seclusion</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen</b></span><b>.&#8221; (33:53)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1628.</b> `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Avoid (entering a place) in which are women (uncovered or simply to mix with them in seclusion)</span>.&#8221; A man from the Ansar said, &#8220;Tell me about the brother of a woman&#8217;s husband.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The brother of a woman&#8217;s husband is death</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1629.</b> Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No one of you should meet a woman in privacy unless she is accompanied by a Mahram (i.e., a relative within the prohibited degrees)</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 296<br />
Prohibition of Wearing False Hair, Tattooing and Filling of Teeth</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>They (all those who worship others than Allah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allah), and they invoke nothing but Shaitan (Satan), a persistent rebel! Allah cursed him. And he [Shaitan (Satan)] said: `I will take an appointed portion of your slaves. Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah&#8217;&#8230;</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:117-119)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1642.</b> Asma&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with her) said: A woman came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have a daughter who had an attack of small pox and her hair fell off. Now I want to celebrate her marriage. Can I get her a wig?&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has cursed the maker and wearer of a wig</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1643.</b> Humaid bin `Abdur-Rahman (May Allah be pleased wth him) said: I saw Mu`awiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) during the Hajj (pilgrimage) standing on the pulpit. He took from the guard a bunch of hair, and said: &#8220;O people of Al-Madinah! Where are your scholars? (Why do they do not prohibit you) I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibiting from using this (false hair) and saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people of Bani Israel were ruined when their women wore such hair</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1644.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed the maker and wearer of a wig and the tattooer and the one who is tattooed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1645.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah has cursed those women who practise tattooing and those women who have themselves tattooed, and those women who get their hair removed from their eyebrows and faces (except the beard and the mustache), and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth for beauty, whereby they change Allah&#8217;s creation. A woman started to argue with him, saying: &#8220;What is all this?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Why should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed and who are cursed in Allah&#8217;s Book? Allah, the Exalted, has said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">And whatsoever the Messenger  (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).</span>&#8221; (59:7)<br />

Chapter 34<br />
Recommendations with regard to Women</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; and live with them honourably&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:19)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire, so do not incline too much to one of them (by giving her more of your time and provision) so as to leave the other hanging (i.e., neither divorced nor married). And if you do justice, and do all that is right, and fear Allah by keeping away from all that is wrong, then Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b></span><b> (4:129)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>273.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Take my advice with regard to women: Act kindly towards women, for they were created from a rib, and the most crooked part of a rib is its uppermost. If you attempt to straighten it; you will break it, and if you leave it alone it will remain crooked; so act kindly toward women&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A woman is like a rib, if you attempt to straighten it, you will break it; and if you benefit from her, you will do so while crookedness remains in her&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of Muslim, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Woman has been created from a rib and will in no way be straightened for you; so if you want to benefit from her, you will benefit from her while crookedness remains in her. If you attempt to straighten her, you will break her, and breaking her is divorcing her&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>274.</b> `Abdullah bin Zam`ah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) giving a speech when he mentioned the she-camel (of Prophet Salih) and the man who had killed her. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;When the most wicked man among them went forth (to kill the she-camel).&#8217;</span> (91:12) signifies that a distinguished, wicked and most powerful chief of the people jumped up to kill the she-camel.&#8221; Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made mention of women and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Some of you beat your wives as if they were slaves, and then lie with them at the end of the day&#8221;</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) admonished them against laughing at another&#8217;s passing of wind, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Why does any of you laugh at another doing what he does himself&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>275.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A believer must not hate (his wife) believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>276.</b> `Amr bin Al-Ahwas Al-Jushami (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that he had heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying on his Farewell Pilgrimage, after praising and glorifying Allah and admonishing people,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Treat women kindly, they are like captives in your hands; you do not owe anything else from them. In case they are guilty of open indecency, then do not share their beds and beat them lightly but if they return to obedience, do not have recourse to anything else against them. You have rights over your wives and they have their rights over you. Your right is that they shall not permit anyone you dislike to enter your home, and their right is that you should treat them well in the matter of food and clothing&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>277.</b> Mu`awiyah bin Haidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;What right can any wife demand of her husband?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You should give her food when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself, not strike her on the face, and do not revile her or separate from her except in the house&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>278.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The believers who show the most perfect Faith are those who have the best behaviour, and the best of you are those who are the best to their wives&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>279.</b> Iyas bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not beat Allah&#8217;s bondwomen.&#8221;</span> When `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and complained saying: &#8220;The women have become very daring towards their husbands,&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) gave permission to beat them. Then many women went to the family of the Messenger of Allah (wives) complaining of their husbands, and he (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Many women have gone round Muhammad&#8217;s family complaining of their husbands. Those who do so, that is, those who take to beating their wives, are not the best among you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>280.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The world is but a (quick passing) enjoyment; and the best enjoyment of the world is a pious and virtuous woman&#8221;</span>.<br />

<p>The Noble Shaykh ‘Abdullah an-Najmi (May Allah Preserve Him) from the mashaayikh of Jeezan, Saudi Arabia is a student of Ash-Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmi (rahimahullah) and Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhalee (rahimahullah).</p>
<p style="color:#777777;">With <em style="color:#000000;">Ramadhaan</em> just moments away, <em style="color:#000000;">Muslims</em> around the world are preparing for this tremendous <em style="color:#000000;">month</em>, hoping and intending to make the most of it. Every year sisters in particular request advice on how to capitalize on the rewards available in this opportune time while balancing their household duties.</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;">According to <em style="color:#000000;">Shaykh Sulaymaan ar-Ruhaylee (hafidhahullah)</em>, “…the <em style="color:#000000;">Muslim</em> Women increases in worship. That is because when the women strives in the service of her husband and the members of her household and she prepares food for them that which will suffice them, then she is in obedience to <strong>Allah</strong>,<em style="color:#000000;"> ‘Azza wa Jall</em>, provided that she seeks the reward from <strong>Allah</strong>. Therefore, in this is a reward for her and also an increasement for her good deeds. And it is befitting for the <em style="color:#000000;">Muslim</em> Women when she is preparing the food that she busies her tongue with the remembrance of <strong>Allah</strong>. So while she is cooking she glorifies <strong>Allah</strong>, while she is cooking she is saying<em style="color:#000000;"> tahleel</em> <em style="color:#000000;">(Laa ilaaha illa Allah</em> &#8211; None has the right to be worshipped except <strong>Allah</strong>), while she is cooking she is remembering <strong>Allah</strong> and in that she will have a tremendous reward. (Like this) preparing food will never divert her from the obedience of her Lord, Glorified is He, during the day of <em style="color:#000000;">Ramadhaan</em>. So congratulations to the <em style="color:#000000;">Muslim</em> Women who services her husband and the members of her household and she seeks the reward from <strong>Allah</strong>, <em style="color:#000000;">‘Azza wa Jall</em>, and by that she does not become heedless concerning the remembrance of <strong>Allah</strong> and she performs what she is capable of doing from the different acts of worship during the day of <em style="color:#000000;">Ramadhaan</em>. For indeed she has achieved a great success.” <strong>[The Muslim Woman Increases More in Worship Than The Man in Ramadhaan By Shaykh Sulaymaan ar-Ruhaylee ]</strong></p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;"><em style="color:#000000;">Shaykh ‘Abdullah an-Najmi (hafidhahullah)</em> will expound more on this topic and offer some points of advice to our sisters on how they can maximize the benefits of <em style="color:#000000;">Ramadhaan</em>.</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allah</strong> to make us from those who truly benefit from this blessed month  and we seek refuge in Him from being amongst the losers.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This means that a person must remove everything covering the body parts he washes during ablution that would prevent water from reaching his skin. This applies to those who work with <strong>paint</strong>. If this substance sticks hard onto the body parts they wash during ablution to the point that water cannot reach the skin, one is obligated to take it off by using paint remover before performing ablution.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This also applies to <strong>nail polish</strong>, which women put on their nails. They must remove this from their nails before performing ablution. A Muslim woman must remove this nail polish whenever she intends to perform ablution or ritual bathing, i.e. ghusl from sexual impurity. She may use this nail polish in her home afterward depending on whether she agrees with her husband that it is a means of beautification and adornment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Source: from the book &#8220;An Explanation of the conditions,pillars and requirements of Prayer&#8221; al-ibaanah publishing</p>
<p><strong>Touching a Woman with Sexual Desire</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issue of touching a woman is another point the scholars have differed on The scholars have differed on this issue into three opinions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Opinion:</strong> Touching a woman nullifies one&#8217;s ablution under all circumstances, even if it is not done with sexual desire. So it includes all types of touching. This is the view held by Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Opinion:</strong> Is the one stated by the author, which is that it nullifies the ablution if done with sexual desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Opinion:</strong> Touching a woman does not nullify one&#8217;s ablution in any circumstance. Rather, the only thing that nullifies one ablution is actual sexual intercourse. This is what cancels out ablution and makes ghusl mandatory. This is the opinion of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas When people would disagree with him on this matter, he would put his fingers in his ears and say: &#8220;It only means sexual intercourse.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Or you have been in contact with women.&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Maa&#8217;idah verse 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless if you read the ayah as &#8220;Iaamastum&#8221; or &#8220;lamastum&#8221;, the Interpreter of the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Abbaas has interpreted the meaning of &#8220;contact&#8221; here as sexual intercourse. As for all other types of contact besides sexual intercourse, they do not nullify one&#8217;s ablution. This is the third opinion, which is the view of the scholars of Hadeeth and the one that we incline towards, if Allaah wills, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Author: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: His book Tanbeehaat ‘alaa Ahkaam takhtassu bil-Mu’minaat (pg. 62-67)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Translator: Isma&#8217;eel Alarcon </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting the month of Ramadaan is an obligation on every male and female Muslim, and it is one of the pillars and great foundations of Islaam. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you in order that you may attain Taqwaa.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 183]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b><i>&#8220;kutiba&#8221;</i></b> (prescribed) here means <b><i>&#8220;furida&#8221;</i></b> obligated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the young girl reaches the age in which she will be held accountable for her actions, by having one of the signs of puberty become apparent in her, among which is menstruation, then the obligation of fasting begins for her. She could begin menstruating as early as when she is nine years old. However, some young girls are not aware that they are required to begin fasting at that point, so she doesn’t fast thinking that she is too young, nor do her parents order her to fast. This is a great negligence, for one of the pillars of Islaam is being abandoned. If this occurs to any woman, she is obligated to make up for the days of fasting that she abandoned since the point when she began menstruating, even if a long time has passed since that time, for it remains in her obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Who is obligated to fast Ramadaan?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the month of Ramadaan comes, every male and female Muslim that (1) has reached the age of <strong>puberty</strong>, is (2) <strong>healthy</strong> and (3) a <strong>resident</strong> (i.e. not traveling) is obligated to fast. And whoever is sick or traveling during the month, may break the fast and make up the number of days missed on other days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;So whoever sights the (moon indicating the beginning of the) month, then he must fast. And whoever is sick or on a journey, then (he may break the fast and instead fast) the number of days missed on other days.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever enters into Ramadaan and he is very old and not able to fast or has a chronic illness, which does not expect to be cured any specific time &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; may break the fast and instead feed a needy person half a <i>saa’</i> (four handfuls) of the food from that people’s land for every day missed. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And as for those who can fast (but) with difficulty, they (may break their fast and) feed a needy person.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 184] Ibn ‘Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhuma) said: &#8220;This ayah is for the old man of whom it is not anticipated that he will be cured.&#8221; [Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree] And the sick person of whom it is not hoped that he will be cured from his sickness falls under the ruling of the old person. And he does not have to make up the missed days because of his inability to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman is specified with certain excuses that permit her to break the fast in Ramadaan, on the condition that she makes up the days she missed fasting due to these excuses on other days. These excuses are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>1. Menstrual and Postpartum Bleeding:</b></span> A woman is forbidden from fasting while she is in these two conditions. And she is obligated to make up these missed days of fasting on other days. This is based on what is reported in the two Saheeh collections from ‘Aa’isha (radhi Allaahu anha) who said: <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">We were ordered to make up the (missed) days of fasting but we were not ordered to make up the (missed) prayers</span>.&#8221;</b> She gave this answer when a woman asked her: &#8220;Why does a menstruating woman have to make up the (missed days of) fasting and not have to make up the (missed) prayers?&#8221; So she (radhi Allaahu anha) clarified that this is from the matters dependent on revelation, which must comply with the reported texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wisdom behind that, then Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in <i>&#8220;Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa&#8221;</i> (15/251):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The blood that comes out of the woman because of menstruation has a discharge of blood in it. A menstruating woman can fast in times other than when the blood that comes out of her due to menstruation contains her blood. So her fasting in this situation is a moderate and balanced fast &#8211; no blood, which strengthens the body and which is its main substance &#8211; comes out of her during these times. But her fasting when she is menstruating necessitates that her blood come out during this time &#8211; the blood, which is the main component of her body and which will lead to a weakness and deficiency in her body. And this will necessitate that her fast not be that of a moderate and balanced nature. So that is why she is commanded to fast in times when she is not menstruating.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>2. Pregnancy and Breast-Feeding:</b></span> If because of fasting there is harm caused to the woman or the baby or to both of them, then she may break the fast while she is pregnant or breastfeeding. But if the harm for which reason she is breaking her fast only applies to her baby and not her, then she must make up for the days she missed of fasting and feed a needy person for each day missed. And if the harm only applies to herself, then it is sufficient for her to only make up the missed days. This is based on the pregnant woman and breastfeeding woman falling under the generality of Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And for those who can fast (but) with difficulty, they (may break their fast) and instead feed a needy person.&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 184]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said in his Tafseer (1/379):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Amongst those who fall into the meaning of this ayah are the pregnant and breastfeeding women if they fear for themselves or for their children.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a pregnant woman fears for her fetus, then she may not fast and instead make up each day of fasting that was missed on other days and feed a needy person around 2 kilograms of bread.&#8221; [<i>Majmoo’-ul-Fatawaa</i>: 25/318]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><b>Important Notes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>1. <i>Istihaadah</i> (Irregular Bleeding):</b></span> This is the condition in which a woman has blood come out of her, which is not her menstrual blood. She must observe the fast and it is not permissible for her to break her fast because of this type of bleeding. When mentioning the allowance of the menstruating woman of breaking her fast, Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is contrary to the woman in the state of <i>Istihaadah</i>, for this state comprises an unfixed period of time, and there is not a time in it in which she can be commanded to begin fasting (again). So because of this, it is not possible to caution against it, the same as for throwing up unexpectedly, emitting blood due to a wound, getting a boil, <i>Ihtilaam</i> (when sexual fluid comes out of the private parts not due to intercourse or foreplay), as well as all the other things that do not have a fixed time in which they could be cautioned against. So this (<i>Istihaadah</i>) was not made as something that nullifies the fast, such as the blood of menstruation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<i>Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa</i>: 25/251]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>2. The Menstruating woman as well as the pregnant and breastfeeding women</b>,</span> if they break their fast in Ramadaan, must make up for the missed days of fasting in the time that occurs between the Ramadaan in which they broke their fast and the forthcoming Ramadaan. But to complete them early is better. And if there only remain a few days before the next Ramadaan begins, then they are obligated to make up the missed days of fasting (from the previous Ramadaan) such that the new Ramadaan will not come upon them while they still have to fast days from the previous Ramadaan. But if they don’t do this and Ramadaan comes upon them while they still owe days of fasting from the previous Ramadaan, and they have no (valid) excuse for delaying it, they are obligated to make up the missed days and to feed a needy person for each day. But if they have a valid excuse, then they must only make up the missed days of fasting. This goes the same for those who must make up the missed days of fasting due to sickness or traveling. Their ruling is like the ruling of the woman who broke the fast due to menses, with the previously mentioned details.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>3. It is not permissible for a woman to observe a recommended fast</b></span> if her husband is present unless she has his permission. This is based on what Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others have reported from Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to fast while her husband is present except with his permission.&#8221;</b> In some narrations of the hadeeth in Ahmad and Abu Dawood, there occurs the wording <b>&#8220;&#8230;except Ramadaan.&#8221;</b> But if the husband permits her to observe a recommended fast or he is not present around her or if she doesn’t have a husband, then it is encouraged for her to observe this recommended day of fasting. This is especially for the days in which it is recommended to fast such as Mondays and Thursdays, three days in every month, six days in Shawaal, the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah, the Day of ‘Arafah and the Day of ‘Aashooraa along with the day before or after it. However, she should not observe a recommended fast while she owes days to make up for (the previous) Ramadaan, until she first makes up these missed days and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>4. If a menstruating woman stops bleeding during the day in Ramadaan</b></span>, she must begin her fasting for the remainder of the day but still make it up with the days that she didn’t fast because of menses. Her fasting for the remainder of the day in which she stops bleeding is an obligation on her out of respect for the time (i.e. Ramadaan).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Istiqaamah Magazine]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Q.3]:</strong> Even though my husband &#8211; may Allaah forgive him &#8211; is a person of good character and fears Allaah, yet he does not treat me with kindness. He is always moody, frowning and troubled at heart &#8211; and he often says that I am the cause of this. However, Allaah knows &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; that I do fulfill his rights and try to bring to him tranquility and peace of mind and I try to stay clear of all that which displeases him, whilst patiently bearing his excesses against me. Every time I ask him about something, or speak about a particular matter, he becomes angry and says that my speech is stupidity &#8211; even though I know that he is perfectly happy in the company of his friends and associates. However, when it concerns me, then he does not treat me in the same manner, nor with the same feeling. This causes me great hurt and anger and I have often considered leaving the house. I have &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; been educated to a good level and fulfill that which Allaah has obligated me with. O noble Shaykh! If I leave the house with my children, try to educate them and live my own life, will I be sinful in doing so? Or should I continue to live in my present circumstance, abstain from speaking and continue patiently bearing these difficulties? Please advise me as to what I should do &#8211; and may Allaah reward you with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A.3]:</strong> There is no doubt that it is obligatory for the husband and wife to live together in a kind and sociable manner. There should be good manners and treatment between them, along with affection and pleasant behaviour &#8211; as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And live with them in honour and in kindness.</strong>’’ [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:19 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And the wives have rights over the husbands &#8211; similar to those of the husbands over them &#8211; in that which is reasonable. But men have a degree over them.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:228]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, ‘‘Righteousness is good character.’’ [1] And he (<em>’alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>) then said, ‘‘Do not consider any good action as insignificant- even if it is meeting your brother with a cheerful face.’’ [2] And he (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said, ‘‘The most perfect of Believers in <em>eemaan </em>(faith) is the one with the best character. And the best of you are those that are best to their women-folk, and I am the best amongst you to my family.’’ [3] There are besides these many other <em>ahaadeeth</em> which are a general proof for the encouragement of good character, cheerful meeting and good companionship between Muslims. If this is the general case between Muslims, then good treatment between husband and wife and relatives is even more important. You have done well in patiently persevering and bearing the ill treatment and bad character from your husband. However, I advise you to have even greater patience and not to leave the house, and if Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; wills, there will be a great deal of good in this and a praiseworthy end for you. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Patiently persevere! Indeed Allaah is with those who patiently persevere.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Anfaal 6:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Indeed whosoever fears Allaah, obeys Him, turns away from disobedience and patiently perseveres, then Allaah does not cause the rewards of the doers of good to be lost.</strong>’’ [Soorah Yoosuf 12:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Only those who patiently persevere shall receive their reward in full without reckoning.</strong>’’ [Sooratuz-Zumar 39:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>So patiently persevere! Indeed, the end will be good for those who are pious.</strong>’’[Soorah Hood 11:49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not prevent you from speaking to your husband with such words, and behaving with him in such a manner, that will soften his heart- and lead to him being pleased with you and fulfilling your rights of companionship. And as long as he is fulfilling the main and important obligations towards you, then try not to ask him for any worldly need, until his heart is opened and his chest is expanded in accepting your request and fulfilling your needs; in this way &#8211; if Allaah wills your ending will be a praiseworthy one. May Allaah grant you increase in all that is good, and that the condition of your husband improves, and that he is guided to good character, kindness in companionship and to fulfilling the rights that are due upon him. Indeed Allaah is the best of those who are asked, and only He guides to the path that is straight. [4]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez Ibn Baaz (d.1420H) (rahimahullaah) [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This small article was a response to a particular question concerning the position and status of Muslim women, and has been taken from his <strong><i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&#8217;ah</i></strong> (3/348-350).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah , Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The status of the Muslim woman in Islaam is a very noble and lofty one, and her effect is very great in the life of every Muslim. Indeed, the Muslim woman is the initial teacher in the building of a righteous society, providing she follows the guidance from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Since adherence to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah distances every Muslim male or female from being misguided in any matter. The misguidance that the various nations suffer from, the path of Allaah the Most Perfect, the Most High, and from what His Prophets and Messengers, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and prayers be upon them all, came with. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <em>&#8220;I am leaving behind two matters, you will not go astray as long as you cling to them both, the Book of Allaah and my Sunnah.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great importance of the Muslim woman&#8217;s role &#8211; whether as wife, sister or daughter, and the rights that are due to her and the obligations due from her have been explained in the noble Qur&#8217;aan, and further details of this have been explained in the purified Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The secret of her importance lies in the tremendous burden and responsibility that is placed upon her, and the difficulties that she has to shoulder. In terms of responsibilities, some of which not even a man can bear. This is why from the most important obligations upon a person is to show gratitude to the mother, and kindness and good companionship with her. And in this matter, she is to be given precedence over and above the father. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have enjoined upon man to be dutiful and good to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness upon weakness and hardship upon hardship, and his weaning is in two years. Show gratitude and thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.&#8221; </strong>[Al-Qur&#8217;aan 31:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High, said:<strong> &#8220;And We have enjoined upon man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. His mother bears him with hardship, and she brings him forth with hardship. And the bearing and the weaning of him is thirty months.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 46:15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <em>O Messenger of Allaah! Who from amongst mankind warrants the best companionship from me. He replied: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked: Then who? So he replied: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked: Then who? So the Prophet replied again: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man then asked: Then who? So he replied: &#8220;Then your father.&#8221;</em> So this necessitates that the mother is given three times the likes of kindness and good treatment than the father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the wife, then her effect in making the soul tranquil and serene, has been clearly shown in the noble aayah (verse), in His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And from amongst His Signs is this: That He created for you wives from amongst yourselves, so that you may find serenity and tranquility in them, And He has put between you love and compassion. Indeed, in this are signs for those who reflect.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 30:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.774H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said, whilst explaining the terms <i>mawaddah</i> and <i>rahmah</i> which occur in the above verse. &#8220;<i>Al-mawaddah</i> means love and affection, and <i>ar-rahmah</i> means compassion and pity, since a man takes the hand of a woman either due to his love for her, or because of compassion and pity for her; by giving to her a child from himself&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the unique stance that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wife Khadeejah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; took, had a huge effect in calming and reassuring Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when the angel Jibreel &#8211; <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaam</i> &#8211; first came to him in the cave of Hiraa. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayi wa sallam</i> returned to Khadeejah with the first Revelation and with his heart trembling and beating severely, saying to her, <em>&#8220;Cover me! Cover me!&#8221;</em> So she covered him until his fear was over, after which he told Khadeejah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; everything that had happened, and said:<em> &#8220;I fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; </em>She said to him: &#8220;<b>Never! By Allaah! Allaah will never  disgrace you. You keep good ties with relations, you help the poor and  the destitute, you serve your guests generouly and assist those who have been affected with calamities.</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And do not forget about &#8216;Aaishah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; and her immense contribution. Even the eminent <i>Sahaabah</i> (Companions) used to take knowledge of <i>Hadeeth</i> from her, and many of the <i>Sahaabiyaat</i> (female Companions) learnt the various rulings pertaining to women&#8217;s issues from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have no doubt that my mother (may Allaah shower His mercy upon her) had a tremendous effect upon me, and has a great excellence over me, in encouraging me to study, and she assisted me in it. May Allaah greatly increase her reward and reward her with the best of rewards for what she did for me. And there is no doubt also, that the house in which there is kindness, gentleness, love and care, with the correct Islaamic tarbiyah (education and cultivation) will greatly affect the man. So he will become, if Allaah wills, successful in his affairs and in any matter whether it be seeking knowledge, trading, earning a living, etc. So it is Allaah alone that I ask to grant us all success and to guide us all to that which He loves and is pleased with. And may the prayers and peace of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He is the exemplary Scholar: Abu &#8216;Abdullaah, &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz. He was born in the city of Riyaadh (Sa&#8217;udi Arabiah) on the 12th Dhul-Hijjah in the year 1330H. He began seeking knowledge by first memorising the Qur&#8217;aan before reaching the age of maturity. He then went on to study the various Islaamic sciences, such as <i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i> (Beliefs), <i>Fiqh</i> (Jurisprudence), <i>Usoolul-Fiqh</i> (Fundamentals of Jurisprudence), <i>Hadeeth</i> (Prophetic Narrations), <i>Faraa&#8217;id</i> (Laws of Inheritance), <i>Nahw</i> (Grammar) and <i>Sarf</i> (Morphology) &#8211; even though the Shaykh became permanently blind at the age of seventeen. He studied these sciences under some of the most prominent Scholars of Riyaadh and Makkah of his time, including Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Lateef ibn Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and also the former grand-muftee and noble scholar, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem &#8211; whom he studied under for ten years. He is eighty-six years old, mild, generous and forbearing in nature, whilst firm, yet wise, when speaking the truth. He is a <i>zaahid</i> (one who abstains) with respect to this world and is one of the foremost Scholars of <i>Ahlul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;at</i> in this present age. The noble Shaykh has &#8211; by Allaah&#8217;s grace &#8211; devoted his whole life to the cause of Islaam and its people, authoring many books and booklets, teaching and serving the masses, along with being very active in the field of <i>da&#8217;wah</i>. May Allaah protect our noble father and Shaykh, and may He continue to benefit the Ummah with him.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Imaam ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Abdul ’Azeez Ibn Baaz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the du’aa’s of the Day of ‘Arafaah despite the fact that they include aayaat from the Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth reciting du’aa’s that are prescribed for the rituals of Hajj. Also, according to the correct opinion, there is nothing wrong with them reading Qur’aan as well, because there is no clear <i>saheeh</i> report that states that the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth should not read Qur’aan. It was reported that the man who is <i>junub</i> (in a state of impurity following sexual activity), in particular, should not read Qur’aan whilst he is <i>junub</i>, because of the hadeeth of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). With regard to the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth there is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: &#8220;The menstruating woman and the man who is junub should not read Qur’aan&#8221; – but it is da’eef (weak), because the hadeeth was reported by Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Ayyaash from the Hijaaziyeen, and he is da’eef in his reports from them. But she should read without touching the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’aan in Arabic), from memory. In the case of the man who is junub, he should not recite Qur’an at all, either from memory or from the Mus-haf, until he has done ghusl. The difference between them is that the timespan for the one who is junub is very short, he can do ghusl straightaway, as soon as he finished having intercourse with his wife. He is not junub for long, and it is up to him when he wants to do ghusl; if he cannot find water, he can do tayammum (&#8220;dry ablution&#8221; using dust etc.) and pray and read Qur’aan. But the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth has no control over her situation – it rests with Allaah, may He be glorified. The period lasts for a number of days and nifaas (post-natal bleeding) is the same. So it is permissible for them to recite Qur’aan so that they do not forget it and so that they do not miss out on the blessings of reciting Qur’aan and learning the rules of sharee’ah from the Book of Allaah. If that is the case, then it should certainly be permissible for them to read books containing du’aas that are a mixture of aayaat and ahaadeeth, etc… this is the more correct of the two opinions of the scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I read some Tafseers (Qur’anic commentaries) when I am not taahir (ritually pure), such as during my monthly period. Is there any sin on me for doing that? Will I be committing a sin if I do that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no sin on the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth if she reads books of Tafseer or even if she reads Qur’aan without touching the Mus-haf, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. As for the man who is junub, he should not read Qur’aan at all until he has done ghusl, but he can read books of Tafseer and hadeeth etc., without reading whatever they contain of aayaat, because of the report that nothing would stop the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from reading Qur’aan except janaabah (being junub). According to a hadeeth narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a jayyid isnaad, he said: &#8220;As for the man who is junub, he should not read even one aayah.&#8221; [2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Muslim narrated the following hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isnad: Suleiman bin &#8216;Abdir Rahman and &#8216;Ali bin Hujr » &#8216;Ibsai bin Bunus » Hisham bin &#8216;Urwa » &#8216;Abd Allaah bin &#8216;Urwah » &#8216;Urwah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (radi Allaahu &#8216;anha):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted that they would not conceal anything of the news of their husbands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel which is kept on the top of a mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is the meat fat, so that one might put up with the trouble of fetching it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The second</b> one said, &#8220;I shall not relate my husband&#8217;s news, for I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe him, I will mention all his defects and bad traits.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The third </b>one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of that) he will divorce me, and if I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The fourth</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot nor cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The fifth </b>one said, &#8220;My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a lion. He does not ask about whatever is in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The sixth</b> one said, &#8220;If my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does not stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get along).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The seventh</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The eighth</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zar&#8217;nab (a kind of good smelling grass).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The ninth</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall generous man wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His ashes are Aboondant and his house is near to the people who would easily consult him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The tenth </b>one said, &#8220;My husband is Maalik, and what is Maalik? Maalik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going to be slaughtered for the guests.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The eleventh</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is Aboo Zar&#8217; and what is Aboo Zar&#8217; (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain . Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Aboo Zar&#8217; and what may one say in praise of the mother of Aboo Zar&#8217;? Her saddle bags were always full of provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Aboo Zar&#8217;, what may one say of the son of Aboo Zar&#8217;? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Aboo Zar&#8217;, she is obedient to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of her husband&#8217;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Aboo Zar&#8217;, what may one say of the (maid) slave girl of Aboo Zar&#8217;? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our house.&#8221; The eleventh lady added, &#8220;One day it so happened that Aboo Zar&#8217; went out at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, &#8216;Eat (of this), O Um Zar&#8217;, and give provision to your relatives.&#8221; She added, &#8220;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the smallest utensil of Aboo Zar&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha then said: Allaah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;I am to you as Aboo Zar&#8217; was to his wife Um Zar&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">May Allaah grant the believing women the thorough reflection upon this Hadeeth&#8230;Ameen!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement; (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying; (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Enjoining certain Manners so that the Mothers of the Believers may be an Example; and the Prohibition of Tabarruj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the good manners which Allah enjoined upon the wives of the Prophet so that they would be an example for the women of the Ummah to follow. Allah said, addressing the wives of the Prophet that they should fear Allah as He commanded them, and that no other woman is like them or can be their equal in virtue and status. Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then be not soft in speech,) As-Suddi and others said, this means, do not be gentle in speech when addressing men. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire,) means, something unclean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُلْنَ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but speak in an honorable manner.) Ibn Zayd said: &#8220;Decent and honorable talk that is known to be good.&#8221; This means that she should address non-Mahram men in a manner in which there is no softness, i.e., a woman should not address a non-Mahram man in the same way that she addresses her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And stay in your houses,) means, stay in your houses and do not come out except for a purpose. One of the purposes mentioned in Shari`ah is prayer in the Masjid, so long as the conditions are fulfilled, as the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَا تَمْنَعُوا إِمَاءَ اللهِ مَسَاجِدَ اللهِ وَلْيَخْرُجْنَ وَهُنَّ تَفِلَات»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the Masjids of Allah, but have them go out without wearing fragrance.) According to another report:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَبُيُوتُهُنَّ خَيْرٌ لَهُن»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(even though their houses are better for them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) Mujahid said: &#8220;Women used to go out walking in front of men, and this was the Tabarruj of Jahiliyyah.&#8221; Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Taburruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;When they go out of their homes walking in a shameless and flirtatious manner, and Allah, may He be exalted, forbade that.&#8221; Muqatil bin Hayyan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;Tabarruj is when a woman puts a Khimar on her head but does not tie it properly.&#8221; So her necklaces, earrings and neck, and all of that can be seen. This is Tabarruj, and Allah addresses all the women of the believers with regard to Tabarruj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءَاتِينَ الزَّكَـوةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and perform the Salah, and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.) Allah first forbids them from evil, then He enjoins them to do good by establishing regular prayer, which means worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, and paying Zakah, which means doing good to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and obey Allah and His Messenger.) This is an instance of something specific being followed by something general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s saying: (And let them not stamp their feet&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Jahiliyyah, when women walked in the street wearing anklets and no one could hear them, they would stamp their feet so that men could hear their anklets ringing. Allah forbade the believing women to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, if there is any other kind of adornment that is hidden, women are forbidden to make any movements that would reveal what is hidden, because Allah says: (And let them not stamp their feet&#8230;) to the end of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every eye commits fornication and adultery, and when a woman puts on perfume and passes through a gathering, she is such and such) &#8212; meaning an adulteress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;And there is a similar report from Abu Hurayrah, and this is Hasan Sahih.&#8221; It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, women are also forbidden to walk in the middle of the street, because of what this involves of wanton display.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Usayd Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah , as he was coming out of the Masjid and men and women were mixing in the street, telling the women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Keep back, for you have no right to walk in the middle of the street. You should keep to the sides of the road.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The women used to cling to the walls so much that their clothes would catch on the walls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.) means, practice what you are commanded in these beautiful manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and give up the evil ways of the people of Jahiliyyah, for the greatest success is to be found in doing what Allah and His Messenger command and avoiding what He forbids.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah is the source of strength.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a transcribed lecture from Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan entitled: <b>“<i>Naseehah Lil-Mar’at-il-Muslimah</i>”</b> (Advice to the Muslim Woman). The source used for this translation was the book Muhaadaraat fil-‘Aqeedah wad-Da’wah, a large compilation of over 25 transcribed lectures from Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan on issues of Creed and Methodology (vol. 3, pg. 281-299, Markaz Fajr, 2003 Edition)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this particular lecture, Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan covers many important topics related to women, such as veiling, being in privacy with male-strangers, traveling without a mahram and other things that are critical for a Muslim woman to understand and implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise will be included as the fourth essay in the forthcoming second publication of the veiling book published by Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing, which will be entitled “Four Essays on the Obligation of Veiling” by the Will of Allaah. May Allaah facilitate its publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Both a man and a woman must cover their private parts with ample coverings, since this preserves morals. As for shamelessness and nudity, these are things that lead to the corruption of morality, the loss of honor, and the spreading of lewdness. But when the private parts are concealed with the covering that Allaah has instructed the men and women to abide by, this protects the private parts from fornication and homosexuality and it protects the private parts from the unlawful things that Allaah has prohibited.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah ordered that the women be asked from behind a Hijaab. What is meant by the word Hijaab is: Anything that covers a woman whether a garment, a wall, a door or any other object that can be used to screen a woman from a man when he is talking to her or asking her about something or handing her something. All of these should be done from behind a Hijaab, i.e. from behind a screen or covering. So he should not make any contact with her while she is unscreened or lacking covering and exposed. Rather, she must be behind a screen that covers her, regardless if it is her garment, her door, a wall or so on. This is since this is <b>&#8216;purer for your hearts and their hearts&#8217;</b> from temptation. If women screen themselves by way of a Hijaab and the gaze of men does not fall upon them, the hearts of both the men and women will be saved from temptation and enticement. This is clearly visible in the Muslim societies that strictly adhere to the Hijaab.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for what we hear about today from some ignoramuses that a husband’s brother, paternal uncle or other male relative can greet his wife, shake her hand, be alone with her and enter into her presence – this is baseless. It is not permissible for a non-mahram to enter into the presence of a woman (without Hijaab), nor to shake her hand, nor to be alone in privacy with her unless there is someone else in the house through which the privacy will be removed. But as for him entering into a house that has no one in it but her, and he is not one of her mahaarim, then this is the forbidden type of privacy and it is dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman has a need to speak to a man that is not one of her mahaarim, she may speak to him, but with a casual tone that has no softness or gentleness in it and not in a joking or laughing manner. Rather, her speech must be ordinary and in accordance with what necessity dictates – i.e. a question and an answer – as per the need only. She must not speak in a tone that appears friendly, laughing or teasing, or in a mellow or beautified voice, thus stirring the desires of the one who has a disease in his heart. This is based on Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8216;But rather speak in an honorable manner.&#8217;</b> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 32]&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;ad-Da&#8217;wah ilallaah&#8217; (The Call to Allaah), The magazine featuring Women&#8217;s Issues. (UK) Vol-1 Issue-5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa was a woman of great nobility, wisdom and patience. She was among the early converts to Makkah and being the daughter of the great Companion Abu Bakr, she was brought up in an atmosphere of purity and devotion and shared close ties with the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was about to secretly leave Makkah for his emigration to Madeenah with his close friend Abu Bakr, it was Asmaa who prepared the provisions for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and her father. She said: &#8220;I prepared the provision bag for the Prophet in the house of Abu Bakr when he wanted to emigrate to Madeenah. We did not find anything with which to tie his bag or waterskin. I said to Abu Bakr: &#8220;By Allaah, I cannot find anything to tie with except my belt.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Tear it in two and tie the waterskin with one and the bag with the other.&#8221;&#8221; So that is what she did and since then she became know as &#8216;Dhaatun-Nitaaqayn&#8217; [She of the two belts]. (Collected in Sahaah al-Bukhaaree (eng. Trans. Vol.4 p.141 no.222))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa was married to Zubayr Ibn al-Awwaam, the cousin of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. He was a very poor man, nevertheless Abu Bakr knew him to be a man of great piety, so despite the huge difference between their financial status, Abu Bakr married his daughter to him. In the initial stages of her marriage, Asmaa has to face a lot of hardship due to the extreme poverty they suffered. Suddenly, this daughter of a rich merchant found herself tending to the animals, kneading, grinding, fetching water and carrying huge loads on her head. She said about her situation: &#8220;When az-Zubayr married me, he had neither land, nor wealth, nor slave, nor anything else like it, except a camel to get water and his horse. I used to graze his horse, provide fodder for it, look after it and ground dates for his camel. Besides this, I grazed the camel, made arrangements for providing it with water and patching up his leather bucket and kneading the flour. I was not very good at baking the bread, so my female neighbors used to bake bread for me and they were sincere women. And I used to carry on my head, the date-stones from the land of az-Zubayr which the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had endowed him and it was a distance of two miles from Madeenah. One day, as o was carrying the date-stones upon my head, I happened to meet Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, along with a group of his Companions. He called me and told the camel to sit down so that he could make me ride behind him. <strong>I felt shy to go with men and I remembered az-Zubayr and his Gheerah (Gheerah is the sense of pride that a man has which causes him to dislike his wives, daughters or sisters from being seen or heard by strangers. It is this gheerah which makes a man protective about his women) and he was a man having the most gheerah</strong>. The Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam understood my shyness and left. I came to az-Zubayr and said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah met me as I was carrying date-stones upon my head and there was with him a group of his Companions. He told the camel to kneel so that I could mount it but I felt shy from him and I remembered your gheerah.&#8221; Upon this az-Zubayr said: &#8220;By Allaah, the thought of you carrying date-stones upon your head is more severe a burden to me than you riding with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I led this life of hardship until Abu Bakr sent me a female servant who took upon herself the responsibility of looking after the horse and I felt as if she had emancipated me.&#8221; (Reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (eng. Trans. Vol.7 p.111 no.151))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the sense of dignity and modesty of Asmaa. See how she felt shy in front of men? See how careful she was about refraining from what displeased her husband? She knew that az-Zubayr had a lot of gheerah, so she didn&#8217;t want to upset him by accepting the Prophet&#8217;s offer of assistance, even though that meant bringing hardship upon herself. And what did az-Zubayr say when he heard of what had happened that day?…&#8217;By Allaah, the thought of you carrying date-stones is more severe a burden on me than you riding with him!&#8221; so even though az-Zubayr had a lot of gheerah, he did not wish for that to cause inconvenience to his wife. Isn&#8217;t this what the marital relationship should be like? One of mutual concern, corporation and compassion? Asmaa could easily have said: &#8220;I am the daughter of the noble Abu Bakr and so I shouldn&#8217;t be doing these jobs!&#8221; but she didn&#8217;t. she was patient and respectful towards her husband throughout her difficult period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that once when she complained to her father about her hardships, he advised her, &#8220;My daughter be patient. When a woman has a righteous husband and he dies and she does not remarry after him, they will be reunited in the Garden.&#8221;(Reported in at-Tabaqaat of Ibn Sa&#8217;d)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And az-Zubayr was indeed a righteous man, as the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam himself testified when he counted him among the Promised ten of Paradise. (See Musnad Ahmad, Abu Dawood and others. Authenticated in Saheehul-Jaami&#8217; (no.50)) He also said of him: <i> &#8220;az-Zubayr is the son of my paternal aunt and my disciple from my Ummah.&#8221; </i>(Saheeh &#8211; Narrated by Jaabir &amp; collected in Musnad Ahmad. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in his as-Saheehah (1877))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to her being the wife of such a righteous man, Asmaa was also the mother of &#8216;Urwah Ibn az-Zubayr, who became one of the scholars of Madeenah. His teachers included his parents as well as him maternal aunt, the Mother of the Believers, &#8216;Aaishah radhi&#8217;allaahu anha; from whom he learnt a great deal. &#8216;Umar Ibn Abdul Azeez said about him: &#8220;I do not find anyone more knowledgeable than &#8216;Urwah Ibn az-Zubayr, and for whatever I know he knows something which I do not.&#8221; (Reported by adh-Dhahabee in Siyaar A&#8217;laamin-Nubalaa&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His son Hishaam reports that his father&#8217;s leg had to be amputated at the knee and was adviced to drink a narcotic, but he refused saying, &#8220;I did not think that anyone would drink something which would take away his intellect to the point that he did not know his Lord.&#8221; So they took off his leg with a saw and he did not say anything but &#8220;Ouch, ouch.&#8221; And in the same journey his son Muhammad was kicked to death by a mule and &#8216;Urwah was not heard to say anything about it but: <b>&#8220;We have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Kahf 18:62]. O Allaah, I had seven sons and You took one and left me with six, and I had four limbs and You took one and left me with three &#8211; so if You have tested me then You have saved me, and if You have taken &#8211; You have left (more) behind.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Asaakir (11/287))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Her other son was of the Khaleefahs of the Muslims, &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn az-Zubayr, who was the leader of the Muslims during one of the most turbulent periods in Islaamic history. He was killed in Makkah at the hands of al-Hajjaaj on the 17th of Jumadaa al-Ulaa in 73H. a few days after the death of her sin, Asmaa bint Abu Bakr &#8211; &#8216;She of the two Belts&#8217; &#8211; also died &#8211; radi&#8217;allaahu anhaa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: My Advice to the Women &#8211; Umm Abdillah al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah &#8211; pgs 253-259</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shyness is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What consists of character and disposition and cannot be acquired. Shyness is the behavior Allah granted the servant. The Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam said &#8221; Shyness brings about nothing but good.&#8221; It prohibits a person from committing despicable actions and displaying degrading behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2.What is attainable through knowing Allah and knowing His greatness as well as His closeness to His servants.His overseeing them, and His knowledge of what deceives the eyes while being hidden in the chests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shyness from Allah may be caused by witnessing and reflecting over His blessings and the shortcomings associated with being thankful for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The praiseworthy shyness is the behavior that encourages the performing of commendable actions and abandoning the wretched.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the statement : &#8221; If you do not feel shy then do as you wish .&#8221; One meaning is that it does not command to do whatever you wish, but it conveys a meaning of blame and prohibition. One way of interpreting it is that it conveys a threat/warning. The second way to interpret it is that it is a way of conveying information. The thing that prohibits a person from doing bad actions is shyness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawee said , The Scholars said that the reality of shyness is the character that encourages the abandonment of despicable actions and prevents against negligence concerning the rights of the people who possess rights over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Al Qaasim al Junayd said Shyness is recognizing Allahs favors, meaning His blessings and the recognizing of ones own negligence in light of them both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When shyness is lost, every type of evil is committed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are five signs of wretchedness :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The harshness in the hearts<br />
2. The unflinching eye<br />
3. The lack of shyness<br />
4. The seeking of worldy pleasures.<br />
5. Longevity in life</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of shyness is Asmaa bint Aboo Bakr in the hadeeth where she carried the date stones and was offered to ride behind the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam but was too shy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Honest Messenger, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the implicit and explicit calls to women&#8217;s engagement in men&#8217;s work, which leads to <strong>free intermixing of men and women</strong> under the pretext that it is urgently needed and represents a civilized aspect, is a grave matter that results in fatal consequences. It goes against the texts of Shari`ah (Islamic law) which order women to stay at their houses and carry out their domestic duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wants to know the innumerable evil consequences of free intermixing can unbiasedly and impartially observe the societies inflicted with this grave affliction. It is easy to find people expressing their disapproval and grief at women leaving home and subsequent <strong>family breakup</strong>. This is apparent in writings and in the media, as this is the reason behind the destruction of societies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reliable proofs that prohibit being alone with and looking at an <strong>Ajnabiyyah</strong> (a woman other than a wife or unmarriageable female relatives) and the prohibition of the means that lead to committing what Allah has prohibited. All these indications prove the prohibition of mixing between the two sexes as this leads to evil consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Letting a woman leave her house; her kingdom and proper place, is against her <strong>Fitrah</strong> (natural disposition) and the nature created in her by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling women to engage in men&#8217;s work has dangerous effects on the Islamic society. Among these dangerous effects is the<strong> free intermixing of men and women, which is considered one of the greatest means to adultery that destroys the morals and values of society.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) created women with a physique completely different from men, so that women will be able to carry out domestic affairs as well as other feminine duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a woman engages in men&#8217;s work, this is considered <strong>against her physique and nature</strong>. It is a grave crime against women, for it <strong>destroys her character</strong>. The <strong>effect continues to her children</strong>, as they lose love and compassion. This is because no one can perform the role of a mother who, when she dismisses herself from her kingdom, she cannot find rest, stability, or tranquility elsewhere. The reality of these societies is the best example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam entrusted the two spouses with different duties and each has to undertake their responsibilities to help build up their community both inside and outside home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man&#8217;s role is to earn livelihood and support his family financially while a woman&#8217;s role is to raise and love children and show compassion toward them. This is in addition to nursing, breastfeeding, teaching children, administrating female schools, treating women medically, as well as other duties proper for women. <span style="color:#993300;">Abandoning the domestic duties destroys the whole family and, eventually, the society becomes an empty entity, a form without reality or substance</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means</span>.(Surah an-Nisa 4:34).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is Allah&#8217;s Law upon His creation that guardianship is the duty of man who supports the woman financially as mentioned in the previous Ayah. Allah has ordered women to stay in their houses and forbidden them from free intermixing with Ajanib (men other than a husband or permanently unmarriageable male relatives) in the same place, such as in work, markets, trips, and traveling. Women&#8217;s engagement in men&#8217;s work will lead to committing what Allah has prohibited and disobeying Allah&#8217;s Orders and neglecting the legal duties a Muslim woman has to perform.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Free intermixing of men and women and the means leading to it are prohibited by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, and perform As-Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât), and give Zakât and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم), and to purify you with a thorough purification. And remember (O you the members of the Prophet’s family, the Graces of your Lord), that which is recited in your houses of the Verses of Allâh and Al-Hikmah (i.e. Prophet’s Sunnah &#8211; legal ways, so give your thanks to Allâh and glorify His Praises for this Qur’ân and the Sunnah ). Verily, Allâh is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things</span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Ahzaab 33:33-34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has ordered the Mothers of the Believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives, may Allah be pleased with them) and all the Muslim believing women to stay in their houses to protect and keep them away from the means of evil. When a woman leaves her house without necessity, this may lead to <strong>Tabarruj</strong> (woman&#8217;s public display of her adornment or charms) in addition to other evils. Allah has ordered women to perform good deeds that protect them, such as Salah (Prayer), Zakah (obligatory charity), and obeying Allah and His Messenger, which protect them from wrongdoing. Then He (Exalted be He) directed them to what benefits them in this worldly life and in the Hereafter, such as reciting the Qur&#8217;an and studying the Hadith frequently, as they both purify the hearts and guide them to the Truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span> (Surah Al-Ahzaab 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has ordered His Prophet (peace be upon him) to inform his wives, daughters, and the believing womento cover their bodies completely when they leave their houses when necessary to escape the harm of people with weak faith. How about working in the same places, free intermixing, expressing her demands to them, relinquishing her femininity and losing her shyness so that harmony is achieved between the two sexes who are different in form and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allâh is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron, etc.), and to draw their veils all over Juyûbihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) <span style="color:#000000;">(Surah Al-Noor 24:30-31)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:just ify;">Allah orders His Prophet (peace be upon him) to inform the believing men and women to lower their gaze and abstain from committing illicit sexual acts. Allah (Glorified be He) emphasizes the merit of this value. It is known that guarding one&#8217;s private parts can be realized through <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>avoiding the means</strong> </span>that lead to committing adultery. Undoubtedly, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>gazing and free intermixing</strong></span> of men and women in workplaces are dangerous means that lead to committing adultery. A believer cannot fulfill those two requirements while working with an Ajnabiyyah in the same place. It is impossible for the two sexes to lower their gaze, guard their private parts, and purify their soul while working in the same place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah commands the believing women to lower their gaze, guard their private parts, and not show their beauty and adornments. He also orders them to wear Khimar (veil covering to the waist) to cover their heads and faces. How can they lower their gaze, guard their private parts, and not show their beauty and adornments when women work and intermix freely with men at the workplace? Free intermixing of men and women could certainly lead to committing these forbidden acts. How can a Muslim woman lower her gaze while walking with an Ajnaby (a man other than a husband or unmarriageable male relatives) side by side on the plea of being a workmate or that she is equal to him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam has prohibited all the means that lead to committing prohibited acts. It also prohibited for women to soften their speech while talking to men as this might stir the desires of men with weak faith. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allâh), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire.</span> (Surah al-Ahzaab 33:32)How can this be prevented in an atmosphere where men and women freely intermix?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Undoubtedly, if a woman works with men in the same place, they will exchange talks and soften their speech</strong>. Satan will beautify their deeds and invite them to commit adultery. Allah, All-Wise and All-Knowing, orders women to wear Hijab (veil), for people vary; some are good and some are bad, some are virtuous and some are indecent. By Allah&#8217;s will, Hijab prevents Fitnah (temptation), blocks its means, keeps men and women&#8217;s hearts pure, and shuns suspicions. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: A<span style="color:#008000;">nd when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen: that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. </span>(Surah al-Ahzaab 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best Hijab for women after covering her face is to stay in her house. Islam forbids a woman to intermix freely with Ajnaby men so that she may not be exposed to Fitnah in a direct or an indirect way. It orders her to stay in her house and not leave it without necessity. If a woman leaves her house, she should adhere to the etiquettes of Shari`ah. Allah even called this act of staying in the house as &#8216;<strong>Qarar</strong>&#8216;, i.e. settlement, stay, and composure, to convey the meaning of stability and heart-rest. This is a refined meaning as when a woman stays in her house, her soul becomes stable, feels peace at heart, and has self-assurance. On the contrary, when she goes out of her house, she feels uneasy, irritated, and tense and she may be exposed to evil consequences. Islam forbids Khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) with an Ajnabiyyah woman without a Mahram (spouse or permanently unmarriageable relative). She should not travel without a Mahram. This is to block the means to corruption, cut off the means that lead to evil, and protect the two sexes from the intrigues of Satan. It was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am not leaving behind me any trial more harmful to men than women</strong></span>. And: So beware of (getting infatuated by) this world and women. The first trial of the Children of Israel was due to women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some advocates of free intermixing of men and women take the superficial meanings of some legal texts to support their claims. However, these legal proofs may only be explored and understood by those whom Allah granted deep understanding of religion. Those who can collect the relevant texts to each other and deal with them all together. For example, they may argue that some women used to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in some battles. In reply, these women accompanied their Mahrams. They went out for many interests, which will not lead to corruption for their faith and Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah), and their Mahrams used to look after them. They were also wearing Hijab unlike women of the present time. It is evident that the case of women going out to work is completely different from the case of the female Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). It is not appropriate to make an analogy between the two cases as it is not completely corresponding. What is the meaning derived by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who were the most knowledgeable people in the meanings of the legal texts and their application? What are the statements traced to them in this regard? Did they call for working in the fields that are for men? Did they call for free intermixing of men and women? On the contrary, they understood that those were only special cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the Islamic conquests and the battles unveils that this phenomenon was not there throughout history. As for those who call for women to join the armed forces and fight in battles like men, this is just a call to corrupt the morals of the soldiers in the name of entertainment. Its man&#8217;s nature to incline, feel at ease with, and like to talk with women when being in Khulwah. It is better to block the means that lead to Fitnah than regretting it in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is keen to bring the benefits and ward off and block the means to corruption. Free intermixing of men and women in the workplace plays a major role in the deterioration and the corruption of nations. It is known that among the reasons behind the fall of the Roman and the Greek civilizations was women&#8217;s engagement in the fields of men that led to men&#8217;s corruption and abandoning the acts that should lead to the prosperity of their nations. <strong>Women&#8217;s work will lead to the unemployment of men, deterioration of the nation, family disorders, and decline of morals</strong>. It also contradicts what Allah has mentioned with regard to men&#8217;s domestic authority over women. Islam is keen to protect women from all that is against her nature. Islam has prohibited her to rule a country or hold the position of a judge. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>Never will succeed such a people who place a woman in charge of their affairs</strong>. (Related by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih) Allowing women to work in the fields of men is against her happiness and stability. Islam forbids women to work in fields that do not befit her. It is proven, especially in societies where the two sexes intermix freely, that men and women are not naturally equivalent. It is clear in the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah that both sexes are different in nature and duties. Those who call for equality between the two sexes; the females who are brought up in adornments and inclined to peaceful life, and males, are ignorant or intentionally ignore the basic differences between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have mentioned many Shari`ah texts that prove the prohibition of free intermixing of men and women and women&#8217;s engagement in jobs that do not befit her. Howe</p>
<p>ver, some people might benefit from statements by Eastern and Western intellectuals more than the Qur&#8217;an, the sayings of the Messenger (peace be upon him), and Muslim scholars. Therefore, it is more useful to cite the confessions of the intellectuals in the East and the West concerning the negative effects of free intermixing, so the opponents may be convinced and learn that the teachings of Islam are for the protection of women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">English writer Lady Cook said that men like and prefer a mixed environment. And thus women are lured to something that conflicts with their human nature. The greater the co-ed. Environment (between male and female), the more illegitimate children the society will have. This is the greatest disaster, she said, urging people to learn women that men are luring.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The philosopher Schopenhauer said, &#8220;Hence, with that absurd arrangement which allows them to share the rank and title of their husbands, they are a constant stimulus to his ignoble ambitions. And, furthermore, it is just because they are Philistines that modern society, where they take the lead and set the tone, is in such a bad way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lord Byron said, &#8220;Thought of the state of women under the ancient Greeks &#8211; convenient enough. Present state, a remnant of the barbarism of the chivalric and the feudal ages &#8211; artificial and unnatural. They ought to mind home &#8211; and be well fed and clothed but not mixed in society.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The British writer Samuel Smiles said, &#8220;The system that has required women to work in factories and industrial areas, regardless of the national wealth it brings, has destroyed the family life. It has attacked, in fact, the basic structure and foundations of the home and destroyed the essential pillars of the family. It has cut and destroyed social ties as well.Stripping the wife from her husband, and depriving children of their rights of proper, tender and maternal care, has resulted in lower moral values for the women. The real job and profession of a woman is to raise a good, sound and moral family. She is mainly required to take care of household responsibilities, home economics and other domestic needs. Work in factories has stripped the woman, as we pointed earlier, of all these responsibilities which changed the looks and the realities of the inner home. Children, as well, were often neglected and raised with no sound standards. The love and affection between a husband and wife were somewhat extinguished. The woman was no longer the sought after, wanted, admired and loved by man, after he got used to seeing her in the factory next to him doing the same thing he does. Women came under many influences and pressures that changed her mentality and thinking pattern on which moral values and virtues were established.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An American professor called Adeline said that the reason for family crises in the United States and the increase in the crime rate is because a woman has abandoned her house in order to double the family&#8217;s income. The income increased but the morals declined. She added that woman&#8217;s return to her house is the only way to save the new generations from deterioration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Congressman said a woman can truly serve her country if she stays at her house which is the essence of a family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Congressman said when Allah granted women the ability to produce children, He made it her duty to stay in her house to take care of children and not leave them to work outside her house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">German philosopher Schopenhauer also said, &#8220;Grant woman total and absolute freedom for one year only, and check with me after that to see the results of such freedom. Do not forget that you (all), along with me, will feel sad at the loss of virtue, chastity and good morals. If I die (before then) you are free to say either: &#8220;He was wrong!&#8221; or &#8220;He hit the heart of the truth!&#8221; These quotations were mentioned by Dr. Mustafa Husny Al-Siba`y (may Allah be merciful to him) in his book &#8216;Al-Mar&#8217;ah bayn Al-Fiqh wa Al-Qanun.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following and gathering the numerous sayings of the unbiased Western writers on the disadvantages of free intermixing of men and women that followed after women&#8217;s participation with men at work may form volumes. However, the above quotations are enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, it is better for a woman to stay in her house and carry out her domestic duties after performing her religious obligations as it is suitable for her natural dispositions. It is for the sake of her welfare as well as that of society and the youth. She may spend her spare time in fields that are for women, such as teaching, curing, and nursing women. Thus, they cooperate with men in developing society but each in one&#8217;s field. We are not to forget the role of the Mothers of the Believers and those who followed in their footsteps in teaching, directing, guiding the nation, and conveying the Message of Allah (Glorified be He) from His Messenger (peace be upon him). May Allah reward them the best! There are many Muslim women who are following in their footsteps while wearing Hijab and staying away from free intermixing with men in their workplaces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us carry out our duties in the best manner that pleases Him and protect us all from the means to Fitnah and Satanic tricks. He is the Most Generous. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“It is not for the women (to walk in) the middle of the path.”</b></span> [Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan (5717) and graded as “<i>Hasan li ghairihee</i>” by Shaikh al-Albaanee in al-Saheehah (856)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Usayd رضي الله عنه that he heard the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم say when heصلى الله عليه وسلم was coming out of the Masjid, and men and women were mingled in the road: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Draw back! For you must not walk in the middle of the road; keep to the sides of the road. Then women were keeping so close to the wall that their garments were rubbing against it.”</b></span> [Sunan Abu Dawood (5272) and graded as “<i>Hasan li ghairihee</i>” by Shaikh al-Albaanee (2/537)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">And today we have women not only walking in the middle of the path, but a group of them together will even block the path in the shopping malls and other places.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Khutbah &#8211; Guidelines In Islam For The Woman</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This Friday Khutbah was given at Masjid At-Tawheed in Stone Mountain, GA.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was taken from one of the khutab of our noble sheikh <strong>Abdur-Razzaq ibn Abdil-Muhsin Al-Badr</strong>. You can find the original audio and transcription here:<a href="http://www.al-badr.net/web/index.php?page=lecture&amp;action=lecs&amp;category=23&amp;f=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">صيانة الإسلام للمرأة </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are beautiful guidelines that every Muslim woman should adhere to. They do not oppress her nor do they take her freedom, as some foolish people claim. Rather they are legislated by Allahu subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;aala to preserve and protect the precious and priceless gem that is the Muslim woman.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>The brother began with Khutbatul Hajjah</p>
<p>Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala mentioned the success -the true meaning of success and being successful is the one who is saved from the fire due to his own sins and his own disobedience of Allah and is admitted into al Jannah where Allah subhanawa ta&#8217;ala said (what means):</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Whoever is saved from the fire and admitted into paradise, then he is the one who has been successful.. &#8220;</em></span></p>
<p>Allah Subhana wa ta&#8217;ala many places in the Quran told us His promise that He will admit the believing men and women into Jannah, into paradise, so He linked success and admission into paradise, with having correct iman, faith and belief, which includes practising the religion of Islam and putting it to practice. All those that a person&#8217;s faith necessitates or requires of him or her.</p>
<p>So Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said in Surah At Taubah:<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allah has promised to believers &#8211; men and women &#8211; Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein [forever], and beautiful mansions in Gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the Pleasure of Allah. That is the supreme success&#8221;.</span></em> (Surah At-Tauba 9:72)</p>
<p>Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said (what means)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens beneath under which rivers flow (i.e. Paradise), to abide therein forever, and to expiate from them their sins, and that is with Allâh, a supreme success.</em> </span>(Al-Fath 48:5)</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;<strong>Secondly</strong>, it is a call for us to realize that having faith, have iman in Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala necessitates certain things. If a person has true Iman, then that must bring about certain actions. It must bring about certain change in the person&#8217;s behaviour and lifestyle. So when he or she acts, they do things that are in accordance with the obedience of Allaah Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. And that Iman (faith) that a person has -that belief about the truth, also makes a person or should make a person stay away from the things that Allah Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has told him to stay away from.</p>
<p>Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala describes the qualities of the believers. And in this respect as a rule, we know that when the believers are described in the Qu&#8217;ran, this includes both men and women unless there is a proof, there is specific proof, either in the context of the verses or a Hadith of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wa salam or through the Sunnah of the Prophet which explains the Qu&#8217;ran. To show that this particular command or prohibition is specific to the males, men of his ummah or to the women of his ummah. Otherwise the general rule is when the believers are addressed &#8220;O you who believe..&#8221; and when believers or righteous people are described, this refers to both men and women. So in terms of the obligation upon us all to believe in Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and believe in the hereafter to accept the truth and then act upon the truth, to put it into practice in our lives &#8211; all of this ummah, all of the believers, men and women, are the same in the regard. And they have the same obligation and the same promise of success and the same promise of being forgiven for their shortcomings and their mistakes and being admitted into paradise and being saved from the fire.</p>
<p>However, in other places in the Qu&#8217;ran, there is also an emphasis given with regard to men and with regards to women. In some places, believing men and women are mentioned alongside each other in the verses of the Qu&#8217;ran. And in some places,there is specific address and a specific description about women believers, righteous women, women who have been commanded to d ocertain things, to put certain or obey Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in a specific way or to stay away from some specific thing. We can say that all of those are descriptions and aspects of what make as successful Muslim woman.</p>
<p>So an example of the general description of the believers that should be true of the believing woman as well as the man, is the statement of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in surah Muminoon. Where He (what means)</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; Indeed successful are the believers, those who are humble and submissive in their prayers and those who turn away from ill and false speech. And those who pay the Zakat. And those who guard their chastity.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)</span></em> (Al-Mu&#8217;minon 1-5)</p>
<p>So for a person who want success in this life and the hereafter, he or she should consider the description and the attributes, the qualities that are mentioned in such verses. Again, success has been linked to a person being a believer, and then in this passage, these verses of the noble Qu&#8217;ran some of the qualities of the believers are mentioned. The first of them is khushoo in one&#8217;s salah. And al khushoo is to be humble and submissive and low in front of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala -in one&#8217;s heart and physically in the movement and in the settling of the limbs in the prayer. This is really the soul and heart of a person&#8217;s salah, that when a person stands in front of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to pray, to establish the salah, that person standing humbly and submissively in his heart and in his body such that she thinks or she thinks about Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and about the remembrances that she is saying, what she is remembering Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala with. And she thinks about the meaning of whats he is reciting which makes her turn to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and perform this act of worship according to, in the best way and hoping to gain forgiveness from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to get the reward of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala through the worshipping Him. This should cause the person to pray with khushoo in one&#8217;s limbs, to be still and humble of Allah, to concentrate on remembering Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in the prayer. And this is the thing that really gives a benefit to a person and is the real purpose of the prayer, to remember Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, and to submit the limbs and to submit ones body, to submit your whole self to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;..And if we want to generalize,because sometimes it&#8217;s true or it&#8217;s beneficial to generalize,one of the things that many women are being tried with is false speech. Speech that is that involves disobeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, and displeasing Allahazza wa jal. So back biting,slandering others, speaking indecently, speaking to males,speaking to men in an inappropriate manner, speaking and arguing and fighting with each other and cursing one another or saying things which involve belittling your fellow sisters. These things have to be considered because they draw you away from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and they draw a person closer to jahannam. These things are forbidden and one of the worse some of the worst sins are related to the sins of one&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p>These are also some of the qualities that Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala described of successful women. They have those same fundamental qualities that men are supposed to have to be successful, that women are supposed to also have, we are the same in this regard. Submitting to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala,believing in correct iman and correct aqeedah, correct belief system, correct attitude,believing in all those things that we&#8217;re supposed to believe in and not rejecting any of it. To have iman, To be devout, obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to have this qunoot,, to put one self to the obedience to to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to be truthful in one&#8217;s belief, in one&#8217;s speech, and in one&#8217;s actions. This is one of the most important qualities, and actually in reality, the quality of truthfulness is not just to speak the truth. This is one important aspect of being truthful. Truthfulness, begins by being true in one&#8217;s heart and in one&#8217;s actions. Meaning that when a person obeys Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala openly, they really mean it and they do it sincerely from the heart. Truthfulness in reality is to be the same on the inside a as you are on the outside. Truthfulness is to be the same on the inside as you are on the out side. This is the reality of truthfulness and one part of that and a very important part of that is to always say the truth. When you speak, speak the truth.Those who are patient from the men and the women. Assabr &#8211; patience, is to remain steadfast in obeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, believing and trusting in the reward from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and that Allah will reward you and take care of you if you remain obedient to him. Thats the reality of patience.</p>
<p>Assabr has three aspects to it. The first is to steadfast,consistent, upon the obedience of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to remain obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala so that no matter what hardships you have or challenges you have, you don&#8217;t allow yourself to do something or to leave obeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. You stay obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. When you pray, you remain someone who prays regularly. When you obey Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in a certain way, you ensure you try to make sure that you&#8217;re always like this. You remain steadfast on this. This is the first pillar of patience to remain obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p>The second thing is to remain patient and staying away from sins and staying away from the disobedience of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. So when you leave and you abandon a sin for Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to be saved from Allah anger and to be rewarded you stay like this. You maintain that and you don&#8217;t give up you don&#8217;t allow yourself to fall back into disobeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. And the third pillar of sabr, or patience, is to remain steadfast and be patient in the face of what afflicts or what faces you, what Allah has written to affect you in your life. Trouble, danger,,stress, the loss of wealth, the loss of life, the loss of loved ones, those calamities and problems that may affect a person as a test from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. The third pillar of sabr is to remain patient of obedience. This is also a very important quality of the successful woman. This is a quality of the successful man,the believing man or the believing woman&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21778</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The habit of lightening eyebrows has recently spread among women; they lighten the hairs below and above the eyebrow, so that it resembles Nams (removing hair from the face/eyebrows). This habit is an imitation of Western countries. The lightening substance is also medically harmful. What is the ruling of Shari`ah (Islamic law) on this deed? Please advise. May Allah reward you! It is worth mentioning that most women request a written Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar), and refuse to abide by verbal ones. May Allah make us benefit from it and preserve the religion of this Ummah (nation based on one creed). Indeed, He is the One able to do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is not permissible to lighten above and below the eyebrows in the way that was mentioned, as it entails changing Allah’s creation and resembles Nams which is prohibited, being in the same sense. It is even more prohibited if it entails imitation of non-Muslims, or if it is harmful to the body or hair. This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>…and do not throw yourselves into destruction</em></span> The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.”</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Wife Sitting with Her Husband and His Friends</span><br />
Sheikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen al-Albaanee رحمه الله<br />
Silsilatul-huda wan-Noor Tape 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Question to Sheikh Albani</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for a husband to sit with his friends in the company of his wife? And what are the conditions of that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Shaikh Al-Albani</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, Islam does not approve of this kind of gathering because it’s a type of mixing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">if it is necessary the conditions</span> – of course – are known, but observing them is difficult. So from the conditions is what we mentioned previously:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Each one should be covered with the proper Islamic veil</strong></span>, meaning; that she should not be wearing shiny and beautiful clothes which attract attention, as is the case with women in their homes. Also these garments should not be tight or short for example, where it defines the legs or thighs or similar to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What&#8217;s important is that their clothing contains the conditions of the veil which I mentioned in the introduction to my book: (The veil of the Muslim woman).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Add to that – that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>conversation in these sittings should contain in it modesty and good manners and dignity so as not to prompt any of those present from the men or women to smile or laugh or giggle</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the conversation has these conditions and is found to be necessary, then the sitting is permissible, but I believe that fulfilling these conditions especially in our time is almost impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadly, most Muslims today don’t know the Islamic rulings (what is permissible) and (what is not permissible), and those from them who have knowledge of these rulings, very few of them follow and apply these rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for that I don’t imagine a gathering between relatives which would contain all of these condition, this is something purely imaginary. And for that the matter is as the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(…<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And between them are unclear matter which many people have no knowledge of, so whoever guards against the unclear matters he will protect his religion and his honor, verily every King has his prohibited land and verily, the prohibited land of Allah is that which he has forbidden</em></span>.<em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily whoever grazes his Flock around a Sanctuary, he will soon fall in it&#8221;)</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this hadith; some people of old times have taken a slang saying: (<strong>Distance yourself from evil and sing for it</strong>.) This is a slang proverb […] and the second saying: (<strong>The one who doesn’t want to see ruined dreams should not sleep between the graves</strong>). Like this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Should a woman cover her feet when she prays?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for her to pray with her feet uncovered, indeed it is not permissible for her to walk in the streets with her feet uncovered, because the feet are part of a woman’s <em>`awrah</em></strong><strong> </strong>based on Allaah’s عز وجل Statement: {And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment}.[1] The woman during the Days of Ignorance used to wear what is known in the Arabic language as<em> khalkhaal</em> (anklet), meaning a bracelet with small bells. So when the woman walked, she – in order to turn the men’s attention to her – would strike the ground with her feet so the anklet would make a noise and the men would hear that; and such was due to <em>shaitaan’</em>s whisperings to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the feet used to be covered. Because of what? Because of the<em>jilbaab</em> that the women were commanded to cast down from over their heads, according to Allaah’s Statement: {O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their outer garments  (<em>jilbaab</em>s) close upon themselves}.[2] And it is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> that the Prophet ﷺ said one day during a gathering in which there were also women: ‘Whoever drags his garment out of pride, Allaah عز وجل will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.’ One of the women said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, then our feet will be exposed.’ He ﷺ said: ‘let the women lengthen (their garments) by a hand-span.’ She said: ‘Then a wind will come and uncover (their feet).’ He ﷺ said: ‘let them add another hand-span, i.e. (a total of) one cubit, and not go beyond that.’[3] [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this manner, the<em> jilbaab</em> of the Muslim woman – at the time of the revelation of the above-mentioned verse: {to draw their outer garments (<em>jilbaab</em>s) close upon themselves} – used to cover the feet since the socks that are widespread nowadays among both women and men were not widespread at that time. The woman used to cover her shins and feet with the long<em> jilbaab</em> that resembles the <em>`</em><em>abaa.ah</em>.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar:</strong> ´Allâmah Sâlih bin Fawzân al-Fawzân<br />
<strong>Lecture</strong>: Risâlah ilâl-Mar’ah<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: alfawzan.ws/node/5405<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> Maktabah Darulhadith.com<br />
aFatwa.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzaan (hafidahullâh) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allâh and may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two blessed Friday sermons, we have heard a lot of good by our preacher (Khatîb) –may Allâh grant him success. He spoke on one of the most serious issues, namely the issue of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) created the woman, just as the man, for a great duty in this life. Each got their (own) task. The men got their tasks and the women got their tasks. If each stick to their own task and fulfill it, the society would attain a great deal of good. If this order were to be shaken, a great deficiency would occur, just as you heard about the role of the woman in the pre-Islamic time of ignorance, as well as her role in the disbelieving countries of today and her role with the religious Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is very important and that is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that she is well taken care of. He said in his Kutbah (sermon) on ‘Arafah in connection to his farewell pilgrimage:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Treat your women well, for they are captives with you.”</span></em> (Ibn Mâjah 1851)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to take good care of the women because they play an important role in the society. It’s not only about taking good care of them and giving them their due rights… this is obligatory, what is more important is to protect them from indecencies – the woman is weak as you know – and [to protect them from] trying appearances [i.e. fitnah] and letting them do whatever they want to do. This is the most important thing the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered [in regards to women], namely that we protect them. Allâh (jalla wa ‘alâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Men are in charge of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allâh and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allâh orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property, etc.).”</span> </em>(The Qur’ân 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it mean that the man is in charge of the woman? Is it only about providing (for her) and justice? It is not only about that. His responsibility is (also) about something that is more important. He should namely protect this woman so that she doesn’t lose it, frees herself and [begins to] take shyness and chastity lightly. This is the greatest responsibility of the man in regards to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “man” in the verse is not only referring to the husband. The man, whether it be her father, brother or some other guardian, is responsible for her and protects her. If it were to go to the length of him having to punish her, he then does it<strong><sup>1</sup>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاللاَّتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.”</span></em> (The Qur’ân 4:34, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is thus in need of being under observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of Islam of these days concentrate on the issue of women. They know that she is the most serious matter in the society. They focus on her. They wage war against the chastity and honour and consider it to be oppression against women. If the woman sticks to chastity and honour, they say that she is deprived of liberty. The fact of the matter is that it is just at that time her freedom (liberty) is preserved (i.e. when she sticks to chastity and honour). She can feely obey Allâh, raise her children and fulfill that which Allâh has given her as a responsibility. She is as a shepherdess in the home of her husband and (is) responsible for her flock. This is her true freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for her freedom in nudity, indecencies in front of other people, flirtatious gait in the stores/shops and the ability to go wherever she wants to, then this is a type of slavery and not a freedom. It’s slavery to temptation and satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O servants of Allâh! Freedom lies in obeying and worshiping Allâh. Therein lies the glory of the soul and the honour of the human and their happiness in this life and the next one. The one who acts disobediently towards Allâh and his commands, whether it is about women or anything else, is one of the degraded slaves of the devils among the humans and the Jinns. It is slavery and not freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to know this! We have to preserve our women among the wives, daughters and relatives. We have to cooperate in protecting them and to refrain from listening to this propaganda [by the Kuffâr in west]. The Kuffâr (disbelievers) are trying to eradicate Islam by all possible means. The greatest ways of destruction is to destroy the woman. Because the woman is the basis of the family and the home. If she is destroyed, the home and the family is destroyed as well. The daughters will be destroyed after having copied their destroyed mothers and relatives. Thus, we have to safeguard our women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even If the Kuffâr have been successful in degrading some Islamic countries, they will never – by the will and motion of Allâh – succeed in doing the same thing with this county, which is the country of the two holy mosques in which the revelation was sent down to and in which the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was sent. Herein are men who take care of her honour, even if some deluded men and women take this issue lightly. This country has men who safeguard their honour and the honour of their female relatives. You belong to them – in sha’ Allâh – and (those) who will initiate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to fear Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) and live up to this great responsibility. If we do it, we’ll protect our homes, children, families and societies. She is thusly the basis. Thus, the enemy focuses on her. They are focused on the woman. They got her in a specific focus you are familiar with; in books, papers, magazines, newspapers, media, internet, and all other (possible) fields. They want this country to end up as the other countries so that the manners disappear and the honour gets lost. It will then become easy for the Kuffar (disbelievers) to eradicate Islam from its basis. The poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">‘The nations exist as long as their manners exist, when their manners vanish, so do they.’</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the manners disappear, then there is nothing left. The purpose of the manners is the honour, behavior, shyness and dignity. This is what the manners are (ahlâq). Another poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>‘I do not say that one should allow the women to show their faces as the men and to walk around in the shops, they have a lot of duties in their homes as the man who is the possessor of the sword and the spear.’</em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman has her line of work and the man has his. If each of them does their suitable works, the society will then be good and the welfare will be complete. But if this order were to be shaken, the society would then become deficient. That is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) <strong>cursed the masculine women and the feminine men</strong>. All of this just to preserve the woman and allow her to stay in her natural nature, religion, character and honour. The glory and honour should be protected and preserved. Read the chapter “an-Nûr” (of the Qur’ân). You will find therein how greatly and notably the women are protected with covering and permission before one enters into the homes. The same goes for the Sunnah. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade the woman from travelling alone without a Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“It is not allowed for a woman who believes in Allâh and the Last day to travel without a Mahram.” </span></em><br />
(al-Bukhari [3006] and Muslim [1341])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade that she is alone in private with a man who’s not her Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“A man is not alone with a woman but that the Shaytân makes a third.” </span></em>(at-Tirmidhi 1171)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade the women from mixing with the men. That is why the women prayed with the Muslims behind the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and behind the men in the mosque of the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They were so covered that no one could recognize them. They prayed behind the men. Herein is a proof that mixing is prohibited between both of the sexes. <span style="color:#ff0000;">If a woman is not allowed to mix with men in the mosque, which is a place of worship and piousness, one can then ask how she would be allowed to mix with them in offices, amusement parks, parties, and markets</span>. This matter is very serious. We’re surrounded by the enemy now and an <strong>ideological warfare</strong>. You are well aware of the ideological warfare that is taking place now. The Kuffar (disbelievers) are waging war against the Muslim countries with weapons, ideologies and all other means. We are, as I said before, surrounded by the enemy. We have to be observant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is with us. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">لَا تَخَافَا إِنَّنِي مَعَكُمَا أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“He (Allâh) said: “Fear not, verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing.”</em></span> (The Qur’ân 20:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is then with us. And if Allâh is with us, nobody can hurt us:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">لاَ تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us.”</span></em> (The Qur’ân 9:40, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But who is Allâh with? Allâh is especially with the pious, those who do the right and the believers. We thusly have to be with Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ). The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Ibn ‘Abbâs [what means]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Boy! Take care of Allâh and He will take care of you. Take care of Allâh and you will find Him in front of you.”</span></em><br />
(at-Tirmidhî 2516)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to, as I said before, be with Allâh, obey Him and follow His commands and avoid His prohibitions for Him (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) to be with us with His victory, His support and His help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allâh for forgiveness and I repent before Him. And I ask Allâh to preserve us and you with His preservation and that He looks after us and you with His victory and help. And may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions</p>
