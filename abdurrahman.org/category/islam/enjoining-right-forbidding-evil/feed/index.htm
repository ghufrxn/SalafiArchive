<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 75 : Point 126</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Commanding the good and forbidding the evil is obligatory</strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">, except with </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>regard</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> to one whose use of  the sword or the rod, you fear.</b></span></p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand; if he is  unable to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is unable to do so, then with his heart; and that is the weakest form of Faith”.</strong></span> [Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding <em>Al-Munkar</em> (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.”</span> (3:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad (s<em>allallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid<em> Al-Munkar</em> (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)”.</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The believers, men and women, are Auliya’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) <em>Al-Ma`ruf</em> (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e., polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)”.</span> (9:71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The hypocrites, men and women, are from one another, they enjoin (on the people) <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Ma&#8217;ruf</em> (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allah&#8217;s Cause) alms, etc.]. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the <em>Fasiqun</em> (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).</span> (9:67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O my son! <em>Aqim-is-Salat</em> (perform <em>As-Salat</em>), enjoin (people) for <em>Al-Ma&#8217;ruf</em> (Islamic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from <em>Al-Munkar</em> (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befall you. Verily! These are some of the important commandments ordered by Allah with no exemption.</span> (Surah Luqman 31:17)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the classical treatise <b><i>“Al-Farq baynan-Naseeha wat-Ta’yeer”</i></b><i></i>[The Difference between Advising and Condemning] of Imaam Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the Daar ‘Ammaar publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Rajab discusses some of the manners and etiquettes of differing amongst Ahlus-Sunnah, explaining the distinction between advising and condemning. This is since these two things are often confused for one another. So the author goes into depth explaining the characteristics of sincere advice and condemnation. This treatise also lays down some guidelines for Ahlus-Sunnah in their criticisms and refutations. It should be noted, as the author states, that this treatise only applies to Ahlus-Sunnah, and as for the innovators and people of desires, then these guidelines do not apply to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee has provided an explanation for some of the important points covered in this book in a two-part lecture which was later transcribed and can be downloaded for free from his website <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, refuting weak (erroneous) opinions and clarifying the truth with regard to what opposes it, based upon sound evidences, is not from what these scholars detested. Rather, it was from that which they loved and for which they commended and praised those who did it. So it does not enter into the realm of backbiting at all. But suppose there is someone that hates to have his error, which contradicts the Sunnah, exposed. In this case, there is no consideration given to his hatred for that, because hating to manifest the truth &#8211; if it is in opposition to the opinion of a man &#8211; is not from those matters that are praiseworthy. Rather it is an obligation on the Muslim to love that the truth be made manifest and that the Muslims (in general) are aware of it, regardless of whether it is in conformity or in opposition to his (personal) view.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, these characteristics are the characteristics of the Jews and the hypocrites. And it is that someone outwardly displays a saying or an action, while presenting an image in which he appears to be upon good. Yet his intention in doing that is to accomplish an evil goal. So he is praised for what good he has made manifest outwardly, while accomplishing by it, the evil goal he has kept hidden inwardly. And he basks in the praise he receives for that which he has outwardly portrayed as being good, which is in fact evil on the inside, and he is happy that his evil hidden objective has been achieved. So his benefit is perfected for him and his scheme is carried out effectively by this deception!!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: Al-Ajwibat-ul-Mufeedah &#8216;an As&#8217;ilat-il-Manaahij-il-Jadeedah (pg. 28-33) [2nd Edition]<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[19] Question:</b> It has become widely spread amongst the youth in these days: That one is required to make <i>Muwaazanah</i> (balance between good and bad qualities) when criticizing. So they say: “When a person is criticized for his innovation, and his errors are clarified, you are required to mention his good qualities. This is for the sake of fairness and balancing between his good and bad qualities.” So is this methodology for criticizing correct, and am I required to mention a person’s good qualities when criticizing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[19] Answer:</b> I have already answered this question previously. However, if the person being criticized is from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and he has erred in matters that do not violate the Creed, then yes, this person’s good qualities and traits should be mentioned. So his faults will be covered by his aiding of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if the person being criticized is from the people of misguidance and deviance or from the people of destructive and doubtful ideologies, then it is not permissible for us to mention this person’s good qualities, if he does have good qualities. This is since if we mention his good qualities, this would mislead the people, and so they would have good thoughts about this deviant individual or this innovator, or this pretender or this partisan (<i>hizbee</i>). And they would then accept the ideologies of this deviant or that partisan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, has refuted the disbelievers, criminals and hypocrites and not mentioned any of their good qualities. Likewise, the Imaams amongst the Salaf would refute the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’tazilah and the people of deviance and not mention any of their good qualities while doing so. This was since their good qualities were outweighed by their misguidance or their disbelief or their heresy or their hypocrisy. So it is not proper that you refute a deviant or an innovator and then mention his good qualities, such as by saying: He is a good man, he has good qualities, he has such and such, however he has erred!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say to you: Your praising him is worse than his deviance, since the people will rely on your praise for him. So if it circulates and spreads around that you praised this deviant innovator, then you have deceived the people and this is opening the door to the acceptance of the ideologies of the misguided ones. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if the one who being refuted is from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, then the refutation should be done with good manners. And he should be cautioned about his errors in matters of Fiqh, the derivation of rulings and matters of legal judgement. So we say: “So and so has erred in such and such issue and the correct view is such and such based on this proof…may Allaah forgive him…This was his Ijtihaad (legal judgement)…etc” This was the way refutations were done between the Fiqh scholars of the four madhaahib and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This does not destroy his position in knowledge, if he is from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. The members of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah are not infallible, they commit errors also. Perhaps one of them was not aware of the proof or he fell short when deriving a ruling. So we don’t remain silent with his error, rather we clarify it whilst making excuses for him. This is based on the Prophet’s saying: <b>“When the judge makes a ruling, exerting his judgement, and is correct, he gets two rewards. And when he makes a ruling, exerting his judgement, and is incorrect, he gets one reward.”</b> [2] This is with regard to matters related to Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for matters related to Creed, then it is not permissible for us to praise the misguided ones and those who oppose Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, such as the Mu’tazilah, the Jahmiyyah, the heretics, the apostates, and the deviant individuals in this time – and how many they are!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The origin of this misconception – that of making a balance between a person’s good and bad qualities when criticizing him – was stated by some of the youth and a treatise was written about it, so this overjoyed some of the youth. I came across this treatise in which the author claims that this<i>Muwaazanah</i> is required. And I came across the treatise of Shaikh Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee [3] in which he comprehensively refutes this treatise whose author claims that Muwaazanah is necessary. In this book, he clarified the incorrectness and the spreading of falsehood found in this view (of <i>Muwaazanah</i>), and he explained the methodology of the Salaf in criticizing and that they refuted misguided individuals and didn’t praise the, because if they had praised them, this would have been seen as a contradiction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] I will present here, my brother, a real-life incident that confirms the extent of the danger of deluding people by praising the people of innovation. This event was reported by Imaam Adh-Dhahabee and others:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Waleed Al-Baajee said in his book “<i>Ikhtisaar Firaq-ul-Fuqahaa</i>”, whilst talking about the Judge Abu Bakr Al-Baaqilaanee: “Once when I asked Abu Dharr Al-Harawee, who inclined towards the Ash’aree beliefs, ‘Where did you adopt these beliefs from’, he informed me: ‘I was once walking with Abul-Hasan Ad-Daaraqutnee when we came upon the judge, Abu Bakr Ibn At-Teeb – the Ash’aree. So Ad-Daaraqutnee embraced him and kissed him on the face and eyes. So when we separated from him, I asked him: ‘Who is this person for whom you did that which I didn’t believe you would do, since you are the Imaam of your time?’ He replied: ‘He is the Imaam of the Muslims and the defender of the Religion: The Judge, Abu Bakr Ibn at-Teeb.’ So from that point on, I always went to see him and ended up following his (Ash’aree) beliefs.’” [<i>Tadhkirat-ul-Huffaadh</i> (3/1104-1105) and <i>Siyar A’alaam an-Nubalaa</i>(17/558-559)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So you see from this story that when Ad-Daaraqutnee did what he did with the Ash’aree Al-Baaqilaanee, praising him, calling him the “Imaam of the Muslims” and so on, those who saw him were deluded by it and adopted the Ash’aree beliefs because of that. This is the same case with everyone that praises the people of innovations and desires, for he will cause great amounts of people to enter into their beliefs, especially if he is regarded as one of the righteous and pious individuals, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (6919) and Saheeh Muslim (1716)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] He is referring to the book “The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups.” It was released in a new format in its second edition and contains several important additions. We advise the student of knowledge to read it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do&#8221;.</b></span><b> (61:2,3)</b></p>

Chapter 23<br />
Enjoining Good and forbidding Evil</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma`ruf (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:104)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma`ruf (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:110)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e., don&#8217;t punish them).&#8221;</b></span><b> (7:199)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;The believers, men and women, are Auliya&#8217; (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma`ruf (i.e., Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e., polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (9:71)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud (David) and `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. They used not to forbid one another from the Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do&#8221;.</b></span><b> (5:78,79)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And say: `The truth is from your Rubb.&#8217; Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve&#8221;.</b></span><b> (18:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Therefore proclaim openly (Allah&#8217;s Message &#8211; Islamic Monotheism) that which you are commanded&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (15:94)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;We rescued those who forbade evil, but with a severe torment. We seized those who did wrong because they used to rebel against Allah&#8217;s Command (disobey Allah)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (7:165)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>184.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand; if he is  unable to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is unable to do so, then with his heart; and that is the weakest form of Faith&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>185</b>. Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Never a Prophet had been sent before me by Allah to his people but he had, among his people, (his) disciples and companions, who followed his ways and obeyed his command. Then there came after them their successors who proclaimed what they did not practise, and practised what they were not commanded to do. And (he) who strove against them with his hand is a believer; he who strove against them with his heart is a believer; and he who strove against them with his tongue is a believer ; and beyond that there is no grain of Faith&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>186.</b> `Ubadah bin As-Samit (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> We swore allegiance to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to hear and obey; in time of difficulty and in prosperity, in hardship and in ease, to endure being discriminated against and not to dispute about rule with those in power, except in case of evident infidelity regarding which there is a proof from Allah. We swore allegiance to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to say what was right wherever we were, and not to fear from anyone&#8217;s reproach.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>187.</b> Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The likeness of the man who observes the limits prescribed by Allah and that of the man who transgresses them is like the people who get on board a ship after casting lots. Some of them are in its lower deck and some of them in its upper (deck). Those who are in its lower (deck), when they require water, go to the occupants of the upper deck, and say to them : `If we make a hole in the bottom of the ship, we shall not harm you.&#8217; If they (the occupants of the upper deck) leave them to carry out their design they all will be drowned. But if they do not let them go ahead (with their plan), all of them will remain safe&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>188.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will have rulers some of whom you approve and some of whom you will disapprove. He who dislikes them will be safe, and he who expresses disapproval will be safe, but he who is pleased and follows them (will be indeed sinful)&#8221;.</span><span style="color:#000080;"> His audience asked</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">:</span> &#8220;Shall we not fight them?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No, as long as they establish Salat amongst you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>189.</b> Zainab  (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to visit me one day frightened and he ü said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;La ilaha illallah (There is no true God but Allah). Woe to the Arabs because of an evil which has drawn near! Today an opening of this size has been made in the barrier restraining Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj</span> (Gog and Magog people).&#8221; And he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made a circle with his thumb and index finger. I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Shall we perish while still there will be righteous people among us?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, when wickedness prevails&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>190.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Beware of sitting on roads (ways).</span>&#8221; The people said: &#8220;We have but them as sitting places.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you have to sit there, then observe the rights of the way&#8221;</span>. They asked, &#8220;What are the rights of the way?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;To lower your gaze (on seeing what is illegal to look at), and (removal of harmful objects), returning greetings, enjoining good and forbidding wrong&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>191.</b> `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saw a man wearing a gold ring. So he (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) pulled it off and threw it away, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of you takes a live coal, and puts it on his hand.&#8221;</span> It was said to the man after Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had left: &#8220;Take your ring (of gold) and utilize it,&#8221; whereupon he said: &#8220;No, by Allah, I would never take it when Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has thrown it away&#8221;.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>192.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Hasan Basri reported: `Aidh bin `Amr (the Companion) (May Allah be pleased with him) visited `Ubaidullah bin Ziyad (the ruler) and said to him: &#8220;Son, I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The worst shepherds (rulers) are those who deal harshly in respect of supervision. Beware, Don&#8217;t be one of them!&#8221;&#8217;</span> Ibn Ziyad said to him, &#8220;Sit down, you are but husk from among the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; `Aidh bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with him) retorted: &#8220;Was there any husk among them? Surely, husk came after them and among others than them&#8221;.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>193.</b> Hudhaifah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, you either enjoin good and forbid evil, or Allah will certainly soon send His punishment to you. Then you will make supplication and it will not be accepted&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>194.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The best type of Jihad (striving in the way of Allah) is speaking a true word in the presence of a tyrant ruler.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>195.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Abdullah Tariq bin Shihab (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: A person asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) (when he had just put his foot in the stirrup): &#8220;What is the highest form of Jihad?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Speaking the truth in the presence of a tyrant ruler&#8221;.</span><br />
[An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>196.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The first defect (in religion) which affected the Children of Israel in the way that man would meet another and say to him: `Fear Allah and abstain from what you are doing, for this is not lawful for you.&#8217; Then he would meet him the next day and find no change in him, but this would not prevent him from eating with him, drinking with him and sitting in his assemblies. When it came to this, Allah led their hearts into evil ways on account of their association with others.</span>&#8221; Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) recited,<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud (David) and `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. They used not to forbid one another from the Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do. You see many of them taking the disbelievers as their Auliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers). Evil indeed is that which their own selves have sent forward before them; for that (reason) Allah&#8217;s wrath fell upon them and in torment will they abide. And had they believed in Allah and in the Prophet (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) and in what has been revealed to him, never would they have taken them (the disbelievers) as Auliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers); but many of them are the Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).&#8221;</span> (5:78-81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) continued:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Nay, by Allah, you either enjoin good and forbid evil and catch hold of the hand of the oppressor and persuade him to act justly and stick to the truth, or, Allah will involve the hearts of some of you with the hearts of others and will curse you as He had cursed them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording in At-Tirmidhi is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When the Children of Israel became sinful, their learned men prohibited them but they would not turn back. Yet, the learned men associated with them and ate and drank with them. So, they were cursed at the tongues of Dawud and `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), because they were disobedient and were given to transgression.&#8221;</span> At this stage Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who was reclining on a pillow sat up and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No, By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, there is no escape for you but you persuade them to act justly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>197.</b> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: &#8220;O you people! You recite this Verse: `<span style="color:#ff0000;">O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error.&#8217;</span> (5:105) But I have heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When people see an oppressor but do not prevent him from (doing evil), it is likely that Allah will punish them all.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There are some Muslim sisters from Al-Mujamma`ah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who say in their question: When we try to stop the spread of Namimah (tale-bearing) and Ghibah (backbiting) among people, those whom we advise may insult and become mad at us. Are we sinful for making them angry, especially if they are parents? Should we prevent them or forget about matters that are not related to us? Please, advise!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>Enjoining right and forbidding wrong are <strong>of the most important acts of worship</strong>, as Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71" target="_blank" name="Thebelievers,menandwomen,are"></a><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden) </span>(<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah (Glorified be He) explains in this Ayah that enjoining right and forbidding wrong are of the <strong>qualities of the believing men and women</strong> where Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 110" target="_blank" name="You[truebelieversinIsl%C3%A2mic"></a><span style="color:#008000;">You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden), and you believe in Allâh</span>. (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="color:blue;" name="Whoever,amongyou,seessomething"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24179" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever, among you, sees something abominable should rectify it with his hand; and if he has not strength enough to do it, then he should do it with his tongue; and if he has not strength enough to do it, (even) then he should (abhor it) from his heart, and that is the least of Faith</span>.</span> Related by Muslim in his Sahih (book of authentic Hadiths).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs and Hadiths on the obligation of enjoining right and forbidding wrong that rebuke those who neglect this duty. It is obligatory upon you and upon every believing man and woman to enjoin right and forbid wrong, <strong>even if those whom you invite become angry or insult you</strong>. Indeed, <strong>observing patience is obligatory</strong> as the Prophets (peace be upon them) and their followers did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) addressed His Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 35" target="_blank" name="Thereforebepatient(OMuhammad"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Therefore be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as did the Messengers of strong will .<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 35</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46" target="_blank" name="AndobeyAll%C3%A2handHisMessenger,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and be patient. Surely, Allâh is with those who are As-Sâbirûn (the patient)</span>. <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says about<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Luqman Al-Hakim (Luqman the wise) </span>that he said to his son: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Luqman, 31: 17" target="_blank" name="Omyson!Aqim-As-Sal%C3%A2t(perform"></a>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">O my son! Aqim-As-Salât (perform As-Salât), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf &#8211; (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you</span>.<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, these are some of the important commandments (ordered by Allâh with no exemption). (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Luqman, 31: 17)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, reforming the society and preserving its integrity are achieved by following the instructions of Allah and then by enjoining right and forbidding wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The neglect of enjoining right and forbidding wrong is one of the greatest reasons for corrupting the society, tearing it apart, and exposing it to general punishment</span>. It is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Ifactsofdisobediencearedone"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24301" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">If acts of disobedience are done among people and they do not change them, Allah will soon punish them all.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>(<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on trials, no. 2168; and Ibn Majah, Sunan, Book on trials, no. 4005.&#8217;)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) warned His servants against following the example of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Children of Israel </span>in His saying: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 78" target="_blank" name="ThoseamongtheChildrenofIsrael"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dâwûd (David) and ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allâh and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 79" target="_blank" name="Theyusednottoforbidoneanother"></a>They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evil-doing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do</span>. (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 78-79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to guide all Muslims, rulers and subjects, to do this duty in the best form, to reform their conditions, and protect all people from the causes of His wrath. He is the All-Hearer, the All-Respondent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling if I see someone committing a sin and I do not advise him under the pretense that he already knows the ruling? </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man commits sins while he knows, but this is from the ignorance of man. Certainly ignorance is that which overcomes his heart the moment he practices or does actions of disobedience; then he forgets the punishment and threat of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The repentance accepted by Allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance”</span>(4:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described them with ignorance even if they were people who possessed knowledge. But the moment they began practicing evil and fell into it; the ignorance over took their hearts, and man (then) forgets about the greatness of Allaah and the completeness of His knowledge; Allaah&#8217;s acquaintance of him, and that Allaah sees him and knows his secrets. This one becomes neglectful of all of these affairs. So there is a must to give him advice, and warn him regarding the anger of Allaah; so that you establish that which is obligatory upon you in calling to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the prophet ملسو هيلع للها ىلص said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;if one of you sees an evil then let him change with hand, and if he is not able then with his tongue, and if able to; then in his heart that is the weakest of faith&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A man went to Ibn ‘Abbas <em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em> and said, “O Ibn ‘Abbas, I want to enjoin people to do good and forbid them from doing evil.” Ibn ‘Abbas said, “And have you reached that level?” He said, “I hope that that is so.” He said, “If you do not fear to be exposed by three verses of Allah’s Book, then do so.” The man asked, “And what are they?” He mentioned this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allâh) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves.”</span> (Baqarah 2:44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then asked, “Have you applied the implications of this verse?” He said, “No.” Ibn ‘Abbas then mentioned the second verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? Most hateful it is with Allâh that you say that which you do not do.</span> (As-Saff 61:2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that he asked, “Have you applied the implications of this verse?” He said, “No.” He then mentioned the third verse regarding Shu’aib <em><span style="color:#008000;">alayhi salaam</span></em><span style="color:#008000;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.”</span> (Hud 11:88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then he asked, “Have you applied the implications of this verse? He said, “No.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas said, “<strong>Then begin with yourself.</strong>”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez </strong><strong>Ibn Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> have prohibited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one</strong></span>. Thus, <span style="color:#ff6600;">if the difference involves a particular issue of <strong>ijtihaad</strong> wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a <strong>clear text of the Book and the Sunnah</strong>, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner</span>, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8221; </span>[Soorah at-Towbah 9:71].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125].</p>
