<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Maniy</strong> (sperm/vaginal secretions that are released on <strong>orgasm)</strong><br />
<strong>Wady</strong> (a thick white secretion discharged after urination)<br />
<strong>Madhy</strong> (thin white viscid fluid secreted due to erotic thoughts or desire)</p>
<p>The fifth question of Fatwa no. 8540</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What are the Wady and Madhy discharges? How can a person purify himself from them? Do they occur during sleep? </strong></span></p>
<p>A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wady</em> is mostly discharged after urination. It is a white thick fluid that resembles the <em>Maniy</em> (spermatic fluid) in thickness, but differs from it in turbidity, and it is odorless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Madhy</em> is a white, tenuous, viscous fluid that is discharged when engaging in foreplay, thinking of or desiring intercourse, or because of a look and the like, at the abatement of desire. A person may not feel the discharge come out, but it is discharged at the onset of sexual desire. It is experienced by both men and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both fluids (<em>Madhy</em> and <em>Wady</em>) are <em>Najis</em> (impure) and invalidate <em>Wudu</em>’ (ablution). Therefore, when such secretions are discharged, the soiled parts (of body and clothes) must be purified with water and the person must perform <em>Wudu</em>’. Discharge of <em>Madhy</em> also necessitates washing the whole penis and testicles with water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p>The second question of Fatwa no. 4262</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the difference between <em>Maniy</em> and <em>Madhy</em>? Which of them necessitates taking <em>Ghusl</em> (ritual bath)?  </strong></span></p>
<p>A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, the difference between <em>Maniy</em> (sperm/vaginal secretions) and <em>Madhy</em> (thin white viscid fluid secreted when having sexual thoughts or desire) is that <em>Maniy</em> in the case of men is a thick white fluid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow. <em>Madhy</em>, on the other hand, is a thin, white, sticky fluid that is emitted when engaging in foreplay, thinking of or desiring intercourse, or because of a look and the like. <em>Madhy</em> is emitted by men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, <em>Maniy</em> necessitates <em>Ghusl</em>, while <em>Madhy</em> necessitates washing the penis and testicles, performing <em>Wudu</em>’ (ablution) like that performed for <em>Salah</em> (prayer), in addition to washing it off from the body and clothes.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that ‘Alee (radi Allaahu anhu) said: “I was a man who emitted a great deal of pro-static fluid, but I felt too shy to ask the Prophet (صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) about that because of the position of his daughter [1]. So I told Al-Miqdaad ibn Al-Aswad to ask him, and he (صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let him was his private part and perform Wudoo</strong></span>&#8220;.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration of Bukhaari: The Prophet (صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) replied, “<strong>Perform ablution after washing your organ (penis)</strong>.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration of Muslim: The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said, “<strong>Perform Wudoo‟ and sprinkle (wash) your private part</strong>.” [4]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The First Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this introduction, the first hadeeth concerns the intention. This is the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the leader of the believers and the second khalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ameerul-Mu’mineen, Abi Hafs (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that: “The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(The value of)<strong> an action depends on the intention behind it. A man will be rewarded only for what he intended. The emigration of one who emigrates for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) is for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) ; and the emigration of one who emigrates for gaining a worldly advantage or for marrying a woman is for what he has emigrated.”</strong></span> [Sahih Muslim, Book 020, Number 4692]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the second khalifah, was from the notables of Quraysh. He accepted Islaam in the fifth or sixth year after the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) message, and in his acceptance of Islaam there was a might for the Muslims. He attended all the battlefields and took the line after Abu Bakr’s (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) covenant to him and he established the Khilafah in the best way after Abu Bakr. In the 23rd year (after Hijrah), four nights before the end of the month of Dhul Hijjah, he was stabbed by a magian after he made the <em>takbeer</em> for Salaatul-Fajr. He was carried to his home and he died three nights later. He was buried with the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and Abu Bakr in the apartment of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). And his Khilafah lasted ten years six months and a few days. May Allaah be pleased with him and with all the companions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of the hadeeth is making clear the rank of the intention vis-a-vis the actions. This is a great and comprehensive hadeeth, making clear that the intention is comprehensive, covering all actions such that there is no action without intention. And therefore, the actions correctness or corruption, the reward upon it or the punishment, is dependent upon the intention. And each person shall have but that which he intended, whether it is a noble objective or a lowly, despicable one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), made that clear in order to incite the doer to aim high in his intention seeking Allaah’s Face and the Final Abode and to keep away from the lowly intentions and base ranks. So if the intention is correct, intending the Face of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>), then it is acceptable and if otherwise then it will not be (acceptable) because Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) is Most Sufficient and in no need of partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) gave a similitude in migration so that it may be reference for the rest of actions. So those who migrate have different intentions and thus the reward will vary to a great extent, even though the action is one (and that is the migration). So whoever migrates to Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), seeking the reward of Allaah and the victory for the Deen and giving help to the Deen then he is the sincere <em>Muhaajir</em> (immigrant), who attained in his intention the highest and most noble objectives. And whoever migrates seeking this lowly life and its vanishing enjoyments is the one who went base in his intention and therefore of the Hereafter he shall have no share. The one who migrates from the land of shirk seeking the reward of Allaah and the protection of His Deen and the support of the Deen and seeking to learn the Shari’ah, so his <em>hijrah</em> (migration) is <em>fee sabeelillaah</em> and Allaah will keep him steadfast on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intention distinguishes the worship from the habit. Take for example <em>al-ghusl</em> (taking a bath): If it is done intending to lift the <em>janabah</em> (the sexual defilement) then it is ‘<em>Ibaadah</em> (worship). And if it is done for cleansing or to cool off then it is <em>&#8216;aadah</em> (a habit).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Emphasizing the importance of the <em>Niyyah</em> (intention) concerning the actions. And that the correctness of deeds and the recompense is in accordance with the intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Inciting to have sincerity in the intention and making clear the merit of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Warning from seeking and intending this lowly life in our actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Showing that people differ concerning their intentions and that each will have that which is in accordance with his own intention. (A man will be rewarded only for what he intended.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>At-Taharatu minal `amal</em> (purification is from actions), and therefore it cannot be established without a <em>Niyyah</em> (intention). Everyone who performs the purification, then his purification is in accordance with his intention (and this is the point of evidence in this hadeeth which fell under the chapter of purification).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The excellence in teaching by the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and his perfect eloquence and clarification where he mentions the foundations and the principles foundations then he explains them by examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is evidence for the intentions place is the heart and utterance of it is an innovation. Also, it is a must to be careful concerning <em>ar-Riyaa</em> (showoff and seeking fame for the sake of this life). And that the <em>hijrah</em> (the migration) from the land of shirk to the land of Islam is from the most meritorious of deeds if the Face of Allaah is intended in that. This is in summary the points relevant to this matter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Questions for this Hadeeth</span></strong></h3>

ABOO MUHAMMAD IBN HAZM &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said in  ‘<em>al-Muhallaa</em>’ (1/77-80)<br />
[Translated by Aboo Talhah Dawud ibn Ronald Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ISSUE (no. 116): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, and prostration during it, and touching the <em>Mus-haf</em>, and (words of) remembrance of Allaah-the Most High-are all permissible, whether upon <em>wudoo</em>· or without <em>wudoo</em>·, and for the ‘<em>junub</em>’ and for the menstruating woman</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of that is that recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan, and prostration during it, and touching the <em>Mus-haf</em>, and the remembrance of Allaah-the Most High- are actions of good, and are recommended, and their doer is rewarded. So whoever claims that they are prohibited in some states, then he is required to bring proof.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan,</span></strong> then the present opponents agree with us about this matter with regard to the person who is not in a state of <em>wudoo</em>·, however they disagree regarding the <em>junub</em> and the menstruating woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a group said: The menstruating woman and the <em>junub</em> may not recite anything from the Qur&#8217;aan; and it is a saying related from `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, `Alee ibn Abee Taalib-<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>-and from others besides them, such as: al-Hasan al-Basree, Qataadah, an-Nakha`ee, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a group said: As for the menstruating woman, then she may recite whatever she wishes from the Qur&#8217;aan; but as for the <em>junub</em>, then he may recite two <em>Aayahs</em> or the like; and it was the saying of Maalik; and some of them said: He should not read a complete <em>Aayah</em>; and it was the saying of Aboo Haneefah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for those who prevent the <em>junub</em> from recitation anything from the Qur&#8217;aan, then they use as evidence that which `Abdullaah ibn Salamah narrated from `Alee ibn Abee Taalib &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; “That nothing would prevent Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) from the Qur&#8217;aan, except from <em>janaabah</em>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no proof for them in this, since it does not contain a prohibition of the junub reciting the Qur&#8217;aan; rather it is just an action from him-<em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>&#8211; which does not make it something binding. Nor did he &#8211; `<em>alaihis-Salaam</em>-explain that he only withheld from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan on account of <em>janaabah</em>. So it may have been the case that he just happened to have left off reciting in that state, but not because of <em>Janaabah</em>. So he &#8211;<em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>-never fasted a whole month besides Ramaadaan; nor did he increase in its standing in Prayer upon thirteen rak`ahs; nor did he ever dine upon a small table; nor did he eat whilst reclining. So is it, therefore, forbidden to fast a whole month besides Ramaadaan, or that a person prays <em>tahajjud</em> with more than thirteen rak`ahs, or that he dines upon a small table, or that he eats whilst reclining? They do not say this, and there is much like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also narrations occur prohibiting the <em>junub</em> and one who is not upon purification from reciting anything from the Qur&#8217;aan, but <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>nothing from them is authentic</strong></span>; and we have explained the weaknesses of their chains of narrations elsewhere; and if they had been authentic, then they would have been a proof against those who permit him to recite a complete <em>Aayah</em>, or part of an Aa<em>y</em>ah, since they all totally prohibit recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan for the <em>junub</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say that the junub may recite an <em>Aayah</em> or so, or who say that he should not recite a whole <em>Aayah</em>; or who permit the menstruating woman and forbid the junub, then these are futile sayings because they are claims not supported by a proof: neither from the Qur&#8217;aan, nor from the Sunnah-neither from what is authentic nor from what is weak, nor from Consensus, nor by the saying of a Companion, nor by analogy, nor by sound opinion. So part of an <em>Aayah</em>, and one <em>Aayah</em> are Qur&#8217;aan, without a doubt, and there is no difference between permitting him to recite one <em>Aayah</em> and (permitting) another; not between preventing one <em>Aayah</em> and preventing another. And those who hold these sayings hold it to be reprehensible to oppose a Companion who is not known to have anyone who disagreed with him; yet they have opposed in this matter `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, `Alee ibn Abee Taalib, and Salmaan al- Faarisee -and no one from the Companions is known to have disagreed with them <em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also there are some <em>Aayahs</em> that comprise a single word, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالضُّحَىٰ</span></strong> &#8211; 93:1 [[Sooratud-Duhaa (93):1]], and:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مُدْهَامَّتَانِ</strong> </span>&#8211; 55:64 [[Sooratur-Rahmaan (55): 64]], and:<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span> </strong>&#8211; 103:1 [[Sooratul-`Asr (103):1]], and:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالْفَجْرِ</strong> </span>&#8211; 89:1 [[Sooratul-Fajr (89): 1]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and there are some that comprise many Words, such as the <em>Aayah</em> concerning a debt [[<em>Aayah</em> 282 of <em>Sooratul-Baqarah</em>]]. So when there is no doubt concerning this, then their permitting him to recite the <em>Aayah</em> of debt, and that which follows it, and <em>Aayatul-Kursee</em>, or part of it and not completing it, and their preventing him from reciting:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالْفَجْرِ  وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Sooratul-Fajr (89):1-3]]; or their preventing him from completing:[[Sooratur-Rahmaan (55): 64]], is astonishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise their making a distinction between the menstruating woman and the junub, based upon the fact that the affair of the menstruating woman is prolonged, then this is absurd; since if her reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is forbidden, then the length of her period will not make it lawful for her; and if that is lawful for her, then using as evidence the fact that her period is prolonged has no meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaat narrated to us: `Abdullaah ibn Nasr narrated to us: from Qaasim ibn Asbigh: from Muhammad ibn Waddaah: from Moosaa ibn Mu`aawiyah: Ibn Wahb narrated to us: from Yoonus ibn Yazeed: from Rabee`ah, who said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no harm in the junub reciting the Qur&#8217;aan</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And with it to Moosaa ibn Mu`aawiyah: Yoosuf ibn Khaalid as-Samtee narrated to us: Idrees narrated to us: from Hammaad, who said: “I asked Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib about the junub: should he recite the Qur&#8217;aan? So he said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How should he not recite it, when it is retained inside him?</strong></span>!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And with it, to Yoosuf as-Samtee: from Nasr al-Baahilee, who said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn `Abbaas used to recite al-Baqarah whilst he was junub</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaatah related to me: Ahmad ibn `Awnillaah narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al- Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: Ghundar narrated to us: Shu`bah narrated to us: from Hammaad ibn Abee Sulaymaan, who said: <strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">I asked Sa`eed ibn Jubayr about the junub reciting, so he did not see any harm in it, and he said: Is the Qur&#8217;aan not within him?!</span>”</strong> And it is the saying of Daawood, and all of our Companions [2].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the prostration whilst reciting the Qur&#8217;aan</span></strong>, then it is not Prayer at all, because of what `Abdullaah ibn Rabee` narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Mu`aawiyah narrated to us: Ahmad ibn Shu`ayb narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us, and Muhammad ibn Ja`far, both saying: Shu`bah narrated to us: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa, that he heard `Alee al-Azdee-and he is `Alee ibn `Abdillaah al-Baariqee: reliable-that he heard Ibn `Umar say: from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Prayer of the night and the day is in pairs</strong> &gt;&gt; [3]; and it is authentic from him- <em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>-that he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>The Witr is a single rak`ah at the end of the night</strong>. &gt;&gt; [4] So it is correct that whatever is not a complete rak`ah or two rak`ah’s, or more, then it is not Prayer; and prostration whilst reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is not a rak`ah, nor two rak`ahs so it is not Prayer; and because it is not Prayer it is permissible without <em>wudoo</em>·, and for the <em>junub</em>, and for the menstruating woman, and towards other than the <em>qiblah</em>, just like the rest of the dhikr; and there is not difference since <em>wudoo</em>· is not binding except for the Prayer alone, as nothing occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, Consensus, or Analogy to make it obligatory for other than the Prayer. So if it is said that the prostration is a part of the Prayer, and a part of the Prayer is Prayer, then we say, and success is granted by Allaah, this is futile, because a part of the Prayer will not be Prayer unless it is completed in the manner in which the praying person has been commanded to perform it. So if a person were to say a <em>takbeer</em>, and then perform <em>rukoo</em>`, and then deliberately break off, then no one from the people of Islaam would say that he had prayed anything; rather they would all say that he had not prayed; but if he were to complete it as a <em>rak`ah</em> of the <em>witr</em>, or two <em>rak`ah’s</em> for the <em>Jumu`ah</em>, or the Dawn Prayer, or travelling, or optional Prayer, then he would have prayed without any disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we say to them: The standing is a part of the prayer, and the <em>takbeer</em> is a part of the Prayer, and the recitation of the Foundation of the Book is a part of the Prayer, and the Sitting is a part of the Prayer, and the Salutation is a part of the Prayer, so upon this basis it is essential that you do not permit anyone to stand, or to say <em>takbeer</em>, or to recite the Foundation of the Book, or to sit, or to give the Salutation except upon <em>wudoo</em>·. So this is something which they do not say, so their argument is nullified, and Allaah-the Most High-grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they say: This is by Consensus [5], then,we say to them: Then you have assented to the correctness of a consensus which shows the futility of your argument, and the unsoundness of your reasoning, and Allaah-the Most High-grants success.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for touching the mus-haf</span></strong>, then the narrations used as evidence by those who do not permit the junub to touch it, then nothing from them is authentic, because they are either ‘<em>mursal</em>’, a manuscript which does not have a fully connected chain [6], something from an unknown person, or something from a weak narrator; and we have examined them in detail elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is authentic, then it is just what `Abdullaah ibn Rabee` narrated to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Mufarraj narrated to us: Sa`eed ibn as-Sakan related to us: al-Firabree narrated to us: al-Bukhaaree narrated to us: al-Hakam ibn Naafi` narrated to us: Shu`ayb narrated to us: from az-Zuhree: `Ubaydullaah ibn `Abdillaah ibn `Utbah related to me: that Ibn `Abbaas informed him: that Aboo Sufyaan informed him that he was with Hiraql, and Hiraql called for the letter of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with which he had sent Dihyah to the ruler of Busraa, so he gave it to Hiraql, and he read it, and it contained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. From Muhammad, the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Hiraql the ruler of the Byzantines. Peace be upon whoever follows the guidance. To proceed. Then I call you with the call of Islaam: accept Islaam and you shall be safe, and if you turn away then the sin of the common folk will be upon you; and:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">O people of the Scripture! Come to a true and just word to which we should all adhere: that we single out Allaah with all worship, and we do not associate anything along with Him; and that none of us should take others as lords besides Allaah. So if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to our Lord</span>.]].[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent this letter, containing an Aayah, to Christians, and he knew that they would certainly touch that letter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they mentioned what `Abdullah ibn Rabee` narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Mu`aawiyah narrated to us: Ahmad ibn Shu`ayb narrated to us: Qutaybah ibn Sa`eed narrated to us: al-Layth narrated to us: from Naafi`: from Ibn `Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade travelling to the land of the enemies with the Qur&#8217;aan, for fear that the enemy would gain possession of it</strong>.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this is true; it is binding to follow it; and it does not contain anything about the junub or the Disbeliever not touching the mus-haf, rather all that it contains is that the people of the land of war should not gain possession of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they say: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) only sent a single Aayah to Hiraql (Heraclius), then it is said to them: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not prevent anything in addition to it; and you are people of analogy, and if you will not draw analogy between one <em>Aayah</em> and that which is more than it, then do not make analogy between this [particular] <em>Aayah</em> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they mention the Saying of Allaah -the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فِي كِتَابٍ مَّكْنُونٍ   لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">In a well-guarded Book, which none touch but the purified ones</span>]] [Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):78-79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then there is no proof for them in it, since it does not contain a command; rather it is just a statement of fact, and Allaah-the Most High-does not speak except truth; and it is not permissible to divert the wording of a statement to the meaning of a command, except by the presence of a clear text or a certain Consensus. So when we see that the <em>mus-haf</em> is touched by those who are pure and those who are not pure, then we know that He-the Mighty and Majestic- <strong>did not mean the <em>mus-haf</em>, but rather He meant another Book,</strong> just as Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaatah related to us: Ahmad ibn `Abdil-Baseer narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al-Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn al-Muthannaa narrated to us `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us: Sufyaan ath-Thawree narrated to us: from Jaami` ibn Abee Raashid: from Sa`eed Ibn Jubayr, regarding the Saying of Allaah-the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):79]<br />
[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">None touch it except the purified</span>]], he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Angels who are in the Heavens</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Himmaam ibn Ahmad narrated to us: Ibn Mufarraj narrated to us: Ibnul-A`raabee to us: ad-Dabaree narrated to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq narrated to us: Yahyaa ibn al-`Alaa· narrated to us: from al-A`mash: from Ibraaheem an-Nakha`ee: from `Alqamah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>We went to Salmaan al-Faarisee, and he came out to us from a toilet of his, so we said to him: ‘If you were to perform wudoo·, O Aboo `Abdillaah, and then recite such and such Soorah to us.</strong>” So Salmaan said: “Allaah the Mighty and Majestic-only said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">In a well-guarded Book, which none touch but the purified ones</span>]], and it is the Reminder which is in the heavens: none touch it except the Angels.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaat narrated to us: Ahmad ibn `Abdil-Baseer narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al- Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Ja`far narrated to us: Shu`bah narrated to us: Mansoor ibn al-Mu`tamir narrated to us: from Ibraaheem an-Nakha`ee: from `Alqamah ibn Qays: that <strong>when he wanted to take a mus-haf, he would order a Christian to transcribe it for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Haneefah said: “There is no harm in the junub carrying the mus-haf by its strap, and he may not carry it without a strap”, and the one who is not upon wudoo· is the same with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said: “The junub, and the one who is not in a state of wudoo· may not carry the mus-haf: neither by its strap, nor upon a pillow; but if it is in a saddle-bag, or a box, then there is no harm in the Jew, the Christian, the junub, and the one who is not in a state of purification carrying it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Alee [[i.e. Ibn Hazm-rahimahullaah]] said: &#8220;<strong>There is no proof for the correctness of these distinctions; neither in the Qur&#8217;aan nor in the Sunnah-in what is authentic or what is weak, nor in Consensus, nor in analogy, nor in the saying of a Companion. So if the saddle-bag is a barrier between the carrier and the Qur&#8217;aan, then a book-cover and the back of a page should also be a barrier between the toucher and the Qur&#8217;aan, and there is no difference, and Allaah grants success</strong>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 28 : Point 34</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">And wiping over the leather socks is Sunnah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370399778&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/wiping-over-the-leather-socks-is-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And wiping over the leather socks is Sunnah.”</strong> He stated this matter, even though it is from the matters of fiqh then it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em>. For whoever denies wiping upon the leather socks, then he will be outside the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>, contradicting the correct creed and belief; because wiping over the leather socks is established from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in many ahaadeeth which reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by a huge numbers of people at every single level of transmission, so many that it would be impossible to gather together upon a lie). [05] Wiping over the leather socks is a concession and acting upon a concession is a Sunnah, because of his saying <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah loves that His concessions should be taken up, just as He hates that acts of disobedience to Him are committed.&#8221;</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So wiping over the leather socks, and wiping over whatever takes the places of the leather socks with regard to normal socks, is established in the Prophetic Sunnah. And no one disagrees about it except for the <strong>Raafidah (Shee`ah)</strong>, whilst they affirm wiping upon the feet. So in the view of the Raafidah the feet are not to be washed, rather they are to be wiped over using as evidence the aayah (of wudoo):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And wipe your heads and wipe your feet up to the ankles</strong></span> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in their view the <strong>ka`baan</strong> (two ankle bones) it doesn&#8217;t mean the two well known ankle bones at the bottom of the shins, rather in their view it refers to what comes under the strap of the shoe or sandal, and it is where the foot joins the heel – that which is called the throne of the foot (i.e. the arch or ridge on top of the foot). This is the <strong>ka`b</strong> (ankle bone) in the view of the Raafidah. It is other than ka`b which is with the people of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no proof for them even with the recitation with kasrah in the aayah (wa arjul<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">i</span></strong>kum), because the well-known recitation is with it being mansoob:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Wa arjul<span style="color:#ff0000;">a</span>kum</strong>’ joining it to those things (which are to be washed), ‘<strong>faghsiloo wujooh<span style="color:#ff0000;">a</span>kum…</strong>’ (i.e. wash your faces and your feet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with regards to the recitation where there is a kasrah, then it is on account of the word being next to His saying ‘wamsahoo bi ru·oosikum’ (i.e. wipe your heads and also your feet). And the proof is that the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam used to wash his feet, and he had not used to wipe except upon the leather socks. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam an-Nawawiyy stated that some of the reports contain from eighty Companions including the ten promised Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, by at-Tabaraaniyy in al-Mu`jamus-Sagheer, Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh and Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah Ibn `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. And it is declared saheeh by al-Munthiriyy in at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb, and he declared the chain of narration of Ahmad to be authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> And Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb declared this hadeeth to be hasan saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“Wiping over the leather socks is from the Sunnahs. And wiping upon the leather socks has entered upon the matters of creed and belief, because some of the innovators deny it; and they are the Khawaarij and the Shee`ah, using as proof that it does not occur in the Qur&#8217;aan. But it is established from the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> through the narration of a group of the Companions. And denying it has become a distinguishing sign of the people of innovations. And the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah affirm it, because of the proofs for it.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE CHAPTER OF IMPURITIES (AN-NAJAASAAT):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Najaasaat</strong> </em>(impurities) is the plural of <em><strong>najaasah</strong></em> (impurity), and it is everything which the people of sound nature hold to be dirty, and which they guard themselves from, and which they wash their clothes from if it fall upon them, such as urine and excrement.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the basic principle for all things is permissibility (<em>ibaa<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ah</em>) and that they are pure (at-Tahaarah). So whoever claims that a particular thing is impure must bring evidence. So if he produces it then that is the case; but if he is unable to do so, or he comes with something that does not establish proof, then what is obligatory upon us is to remain upon what is necessitated by the basic principle and the basic natural state.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because passing a judgement that something is impure is a ruling which will bring about general duty and responsibility, so it is not permissible except after proof has been established. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So from that which has been proven to be impure are:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1 &amp; 2: Human urine and excrement:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for excrement (<em>al-ghaa.it</em>), then because of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>If one of you steps with his shoe upon something harmful (<em>al-Adhaa</em>), then the earth will be purification for it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘al-Adhaa’ is everything which harms/offends, from impurities, filth, rocks, thorns, and other then that. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it in the hadeeth is impurity (<em>najaasah</em>), as is clear. As for urine, then because of the hadeeth of Anas: that a bedouin man urinated in the mosque, so some people stood up to restrain him. So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Leave him, and do not interrupt him</strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “When he finished he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) called for a bucket of water, and poured it upon it.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3 &amp; 4 Pre-seminal fluid (al-madhee) and ‘al-wadee’:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for pre-seminal fluid, then it is clear, thin, slippery fluid which discharges when there is (sexual) desire. Its discharge does not itself give a feeling of delight, nor does it shoot out all at once, nor is it followed by slackness. The person may not notice its discharge, and this happens to men and women. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is impure (<em>najas</em>), and therefore the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) ordered that the penis be washed from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Alee who said: “ I was a man who had profuse pre-seminal discharge, and I felt shy to ask the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) because of my position with respect to his daughter. So I told al-Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad, and he asked him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>He should wash his penis and perform wudoo</strong>..&gt;&gt; ” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for ‘<em>al-wadee</em>’, then it is a thick white fluid which may come out after urination, [9] and it is impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas who said: “Semen, and ‘<em>al-wadee</em>’, and pre-seminal fluid (<em>al madhee</em>). As for semen, then it is what necessitates a bath (<em>ghusl</em>); and as for ‘alwadee’and ‘al-madhee’, then he said: “Wash your penis, or: the parts of your penis, and perform wudoo. in the manner in which you perform wudoo· for the Prayer.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. The dung of animals whose meat may not be eaten:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdullaah who said: the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wanted to go out to the toilet, so he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Bring me three stones</strong>.&gt;&gt; So I found two stones for him and a piece of dung from a donkey. So he took hold of the two stones, and he threw the piece of dung away, and he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>It is something impure</strong>.&gt;&gt; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. Menstrual blood:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa· bint Abee Bakr who said: “A woman came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said: ‘If menstrual blood falls on the garment of one of us, what should she do?’ So he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>She should scrape it off, then she should rub it with water, then she should wash it (all). Then she can pray whilst wearing it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. The saliva of a dog:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah who said, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The purification for the vessel of one of you if a dog licks from it is that he washes it seven times, the first of them being with earth</strong>.&gt;&gt; [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Animal carcasses:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring to animals which die without having been slaughtered in the legislated manner, because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>When an animal skin is tanned then it has become pure</strong>.&gt;&gt; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an ‘animal skin’ (<em>ihaab</em>) is the hide of an animal which has died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And exceptions to that [15] are:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(i) Dead fish and locusts</span></strong>, because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar- radiyallaahu `anhu)maa- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Two dead animals and forms of blood have been made lawful for us. As for the two dead animals, then they are fish and locusts; and as for the two forms of blood it is the liver and the spleen</strong>.&gt;&gt; [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Dead animals which do not have blood which flows</span></strong>, such as flies, ants, bees, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>If a fly falls into the vessel of one of you then let him immerse it in it, totally. Then let him throw it out, for indeed in one of its wings there is a poison and in the other there is a remedy</strong>.&gt;&gt; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(iii) The bones of a dead animal, and its horn, claws, hair, and feathers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of that is pure, in keeping with the basic principle, which is that things are pure; and because of what al-Bukhaaree reported in disconnected form,[18] saying, ‘az-Zuhree said about the bones of a dead animal, such as the elephant and its like, “I met people from the Salaf of the scholars using it as combs, and as pots for oil. They did not see any harm in that.” And Hammaad said: “There is no harm in (using) the feathers of dead birds.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HOW IMPURITY IS TO BE PURIFIED.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know that the bringer of the legislation, who made us aware that a thing is impure, or causes other things to become impure, has also made us aware of how we are able to purify it. So what is obligatory upon us is to follow his saying and to comply with his command. So whatever it is reported about that it must be washed until no colour, smell, or taste remains from it, then that is its purification; and whatever it is reported about that water must be poured upon it, or sprinkled upon it, or that it should be scraped, or wiped upon the earth, or merely walking upon pure earth, then that is its purification. Furthermore you should know that water is the basic substance for purifying impurities, since the bringer of the Legislation described it with his saying: &lt;&lt;<strong>Allaah created water as being pure and purifying</strong>&gt;&gt; [19], so nothing else besides it is turned to, unless that is established from the bringer of the legislation; otherwise not, since it would be a case of turning aside from something known to be a purifier towards something which is not known to be a purifier, and this would be a departure from what the legislated manner of proceeding demands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you know this, then here is what occurs in the legislation regarding the manner of purifying substances which are impure or which cause impurity:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Purifying the animal through tanning:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- who said: I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Whichever animal skin is tanned, then it becomes pure</strong>.&gt;&gt; [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Purifying the vessel which a dog has licked:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah- radiyallaahu `anhu- that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>The purification of the vessel of one of you when a dog has licked it is that he washes it seven times, the first of them being with the earth</strong>.&gt;&gt; [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Purifying a garment which menstrual blood has fallen onto:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa· bint Abee Bakr -radiyallaahu `anhaa- who said: A woman came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said: “If menstrual blood falls onto the garment of one of us, what should she do?” So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>She should scrape it off, then she should rub it with water, then she should wash it (all). Then she can pray whilst wearing it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a trace still remains after that, then there is no harm: From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- that Khawlah bint Yasaar said, “O Messenger of Allaah! I have only a single garment, and I menstruate whilst wearing it.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>When you become clean wash the place of the blood, then pray whilst wearing it</strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “O Messenger of Allaah! If its trace is not removed?” He said:<br />
&lt;&lt;<strong>The water will suffice you, and its trace will not harm you</strong>.&gt;&gt; [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. Purifying the trailing hem of the woman’s garment:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From a slave-girl who gave birth to a child of Ibraaheem ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, that she asked Umm Salamah -the wife of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) I am a woman who makes the hem of my garment long, then what if I walk upon a filthy place?” So Umm Salamah said: “The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>What comes after it will purify it.</strong>&gt;&gt; [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Purifying the garment from the urine of a suckling baby:</strong></span> [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abus-Samh, the servant of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) who said: “The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>It should be washed from the urine of a girl, and sprinkled with water from the urine of a boy</strong>.&gt;&gt;[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. Purifying the garment from pre-seminal fluid (madhee):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Sahl ibn Hunayf who said: I used to experience difficulty and trouble on account of pre-seminal fluid, and I used to frequently take a bath from it. So I mentioned that to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The wudoo· would suffice you for that</strong>.”&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “What about that which fall upon my garment from it?” He said:<br />
&lt;&lt;<strong>It will suffice you to take a handful of water, and to rub your garment with it wherever you see it has fallen upon it</strong>.&gt;&gt; [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Purifying the underneath of the shoe:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Sa`eed -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>When one of you comes to the mosque, then let him turn his shoes over and examine them. So if he sees some filth, then let him wipe it upon the earth, then let him pray whilst wearing them</strong>.&gt;&gt; [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Purifying the earth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “A Bedouin stood and urinated in the mosque. So the people began raising their voices against him. So the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Leave him, and pour a bucket of water upon his urine; for you were sent as people who make things easy, and you were not sent as people who make things difficult</strong>.&gt;&gt; [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) commanded that in order to quickly purify the earth. So if it had been left until it became dry, and then the trace of the impurity departed, then it would have become pure, because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Dogs used to urinate in the mosque, and come and go, in the time of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and they had not used to sprinkle anything upon it.” [30]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE BATH (al-Ghusl):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Those things which make it obligatory:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">1) Semen coming out whilst awake or during sleep:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Taking a bath is binding if semen comes out.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Umm Salamah that Umm Sulaym said: <strong>“O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah is not shy of the truth, so is the bath binding upon the woman if she has a sexual dream.” He said: “Yes if she sees semen.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having desire is a condition if a person is awake but not during sleep. Because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you ejaculate semen then take a bath from janaabah, but if you do not ejaculate it with force then do not take a bath.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ash-Shawkaanee [4] said: ‘al-hadhf means firing out, and it does not occur in this manner except as a result of desire and it contains a point of note that that which comes out without desire, either because of illness or severe cold, does not necessitate taking a bath.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever has a sexual dream and does not find semen, then there is no bath due upon him. And whoever finds semen but does not remember any sexual dream then taking a bath is upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah-radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was asked about the man who finds liquid but does not remember any sexual dream, so he said: “He should take a bath.” And he was asked about a man who sees that he had intercourse in a dream but he does not find any liquid. So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:”There is no bath due upon him.</strong>” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2) Sexual intercourse, even if he does not ejaculate:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) that he said: <strong>“If he sits between her four limbs, and he has intercourse with her, then the bath has become obligatory, even if he did not ejaculate.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3) An Unbeliever accepting Islaam:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qays ibn `Aasim that he accepted Islaam, so the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) ordered him to take a bath with water and lote-tree leaves. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4) The cessation of the menstrual period and after-birth bleeding:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Faatimah bint Abee Hubaysh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When the menstrual period comes then leave off the Prayer; and when it departs, then take a bath and pray.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And after-birth bleeding is just like the menstruation period by consensus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5) The day of Jumu`ah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: <strong>“Taking the bath for the Jumu`ah is obligatory upon every adult.”</strong> [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Its Pillars:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Intention: Because of the hadeeth:”<strong>Actions are but by intentions…</strong>” [10]<br />
2) Covering the whole body with water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its recommended form:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) took a bath from janaabah he would begin and wash his hands, then he would pour water with his right hand over his left hand and wash his genitals. Then he would perform the wudoo· in the manner in which he performed the wudoo· for the Prayer. Then he would take the water and enter his fingers into the roots of his hair until he saw that he had caused the water to reach all parts of it. Then he would take three handfuls of water and put it upon his head. Then he washed his feet.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Point of note:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not obligatory upon the woman to undo her hair when taking a bath from janaabah, but it is obligatory upon her to do that in the bath for the menstrual period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Umm Salamah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said: ‘I said: “O Messenger of Allaah! I am a woman who ties my hair into plaits. Shall I undo it for the bath of janaabah?” He said: “No, it would suffice you to pour three handfuls of water upon your head, then make the water flow upon yourself, and you will be clean.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that Asmaa· asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) about the bath from menstruation. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“One of you should take her water and her lote-tree leaves, so she should purify herself and purify herself in a good manner then she should pour it upon her head and strongly rub it in until she reaches the roots upon her hair. Then she should pour the water upon herself, then she should take a piece of cloth with musk upon it and clean herself with it.” So Asmaa· said: ‘How should she clean herself with it? so he said “Subhaanallaah! (How perfect is Allaah!) She should clean herself with it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So `Aa·ishah said to her, and it is as if she said it secretly to her: ‘You should wipe away the trace of blood with it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And she asked him about the bath of janaabah. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“She should take some water and purify herself, and clean herself in a good manner, or perform the purification fully. Then she should pour it upon her head, and rub it in until she reaches the roots of (the hair) upon her head. Then she should pour the water upon herself.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth clearly shows a difference between the bath which a woman takes from her menses, and her bath from the state of janaabah, since he emphasised upon the menstruating woman that she should exert in rubbing strongly, and in purifying, in a way in which he did not emphasis regarding her bath from janaabah. Just as the hadeeth of Umm Salamah is a proof that it is not obligatory to undo the hair in her bath from janaabah. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the basic rule is to undo the hair to make certain that the water reaches whatever is underneath it. Except that it has been pardoned in the bath of janaabah because of the fact that it happens repeatedly, and that it would create severe difficulty to have to undo it for that. Contrary to the bath after the menses because it happens only once a month. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A point of note:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the two spouses to take a bath together in a single place, each of them looking at the private part of the other; because of the saying of `Aa·ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhaa: ‘I used to take a bath, I and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) from a single vessel, when we were in a state of janaabah.’ [16]</p>
<h3><strong>The recommended baths:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1-Taking a bath at each act of sexual intercourse:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Aboo Raafi` that one night the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) had relations with all of his wives in succession, taking a bath with this one, and with this one. He said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Why don’t you make it a single bath?” So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is purer, and better, and cleaner.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2- The woman who has continual bleeding</span></strong> taking a bath for every Prayer, or one bath for the Zuhr Prayer and `Asr Prayer together, and one bath for the Maghrib and the `Ishaa· Prayer together, and one bath for the Fajr Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said: “Umm Habeebah had continual bleeding in the time of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) so he commanded her to take a bath for every Prayer….the hadeeth.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration from her a woman had continual bleeding in the time of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) so she was commanded that she should bring the `Asr Prayer forward and delay the Dhur Prayer, and that she should take a single bath for both of them; and that she should delay the Maghrib Prayer and bring forward the `Ishaa· Prayer, and take a bath for the two of them, and that she should take a bath for the Dawn Prayer. [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3- Taking a bath after becoming unconscious:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that she said Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) became very ill. So he said: “Have the people prayed?” So we said: ‘No, they are waiting for you O Messenger of Allaah’. So he said: “Put some water in the tub for me.” She said so we did so. So he took a bath and then he tried to stand but he fell unconscious. Then he came around and he said: “Have the people prayed?” So we said: ‘No, they are waiting for you O Messenger of Allaah’. He said put some water for me in the tub. She said so we did so. So he took a bath then he tried to stand up and he fainted. Then he came around and he said:” Have the people prayed?” So we said: ‘No, they are waiting for you O Messenger of Allaah’. And she mentioned his sending a message to Aboo Bakr, and the completion of the hadeeth. [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4- Taking a bath after burying a Mushrik:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhu- that he came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and he said: “Aboo Taalib has died.” So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: “Go and bury him.” So when I had buried him I came back to him, and he said to me: “Take a bath.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5- Taking a bath for the two `Eeds and for the Day of `Arafah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of what al-Bayhaqee reported, by way of ash-Shaafi`ee: from Zaadhaan, who said: “A man asked `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu- about the bath.” So he said: “Take a bath every day if you want to.” So he said: “No, the bath which is the bath.” He said: “The Day of Jumu`ah, and the Day of `Arafah, and the Day of Sacrifice, and the Day of Fitr.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">6- Taking a bath after washing the dead:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) saying: “Whoever washes a dead person then let him take a bath.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- Taking a bath for the state of Ihraam for `Umrah or Hajj:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Zayd ibn Thaabit that he saw the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) remove his (usual) clothes for entering the state of Ihraam, and he took a bath. [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">8- Taking a bath to enter Makkah:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- that he had not used to come to Makkah except that he would spend the night at Dhee Tuwaa, and then enter the morning. So he would take a bath and then enter Makkah in the day time; and he mentioned from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) that he did it. [25]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>WIPING OVER THE LEATHER SOCKS (al-Mash `alal-khuffayn)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee -rahimahullaah- said in his explanation of Muslim (3/164):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Those whose sayings are counted in consensus have agreed that it is permissible to wipe over the leather socks, when on a journey and when in residence, whether it is done for a need or otherwise, to the extent that it is permissible for the woman who stays within her house, and at times when the person is not walking about. It is only criticised by the Shee`ah and the Khawaarij, and their disagreement is not counted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hasan al-Basree -rahimahullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Seventy of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to wipe upon the leather socks</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the best thing that is used as evidence for the permissibility of wiping is that which Muslim reported from al-A`mash: from Ibraaheem from Hammaam, who said: Jareer urinated, and then he performed wudoo·, and he wiped over his leather socks. So it was said: “You do this.” He said, “Yes, I saw Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) urinate, and then he performed the wudoo·, and then he wiped over his leather socks.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash said: Ibraaheem said: “This hadeeth used to please them, because the Islaam of Jareer happened after Sooratul-Maa·idah came down’’. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an-Nawawee said [2] : ‘Meaning that Allaah- the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Then wash your faces and your arms up to and including the elbows, and wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to and including the ankle bones.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul Maa·idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “So if the Islaam of Jareer had come before the descent of al-Maa·idah it would have been possible that his hadeeth about wiping over the leather socks was abrogated by the Aayah of al-Maa.idah, but since his Islaam came later on, then we know for certain that his hadeeth is to be acted upon; and it clarifies that the one who is meant by the Aayah is the person who is not wearing leather socks. So therefore the Sunnah particularises the Aayah, and Allaah knows best.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its Conditions:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a condition for the permissibility of wiping that he should wear the leather socks upon the state of having made wudoo·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I was with the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) one night on a journey. So I poured water out for him from the pot, and he washed his face and his two forearms, and he wiped his head. Then I reached down to remove his leather socks, so he said: <strong>“Leave them because I entered them both in a state of purification.” And he wiped over them.</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The time period for wiping:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) laid down three days and their nights for the traveller,and one day and night for the resident. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The place of wiping and its description:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The place which it is legislated to wipe is the upper surface of the leather sock, because of the saying of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib -radiyallaahu `anhu- : “If the Religion were in accordance with opinion, then underneath of the leather sock would have more right to be wiped then its top part, but I saw Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wiping over the upper surface of his leather socks.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is obligatory in wiping is whatever the term ‘wiping’ is applied to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Wiping over socks and sandals:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just as it is permissible to wipe upon leather socks then it is permissible to wipe upon normal socks and upon sandals, because of the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) performed the wudoo·, and he wiped over the socks and the sandals. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Ubayd ibn Juraij who said: “ It was said to Ibn `Umar: We have seen you doing something which we did not see anyone else besides you doing.’ He said: ‘And what is it?’ They said: ‘We have seen you wearing these animal- hair sandals.’ He said: ‘I saw Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wearing them and performing wudoo· in them, and he wiped over them.’ [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>That which nullifies the wiping:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wiping is annulled by one of these three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Completion of the time period, because wiping has a time limit, as you have known. So it is not permissible to increase upon the time period which has been established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Janaabah: Because of the hadeeth of Safwaan: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to command us when we were upon a journey that we should not remove our leather socks for three days along with their nights except from janaabah, but rather from passing excrement, and urine and sleep.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Removing that which has been wiped upon from the feet, because if he removes them, and then wears them again, then he will not have entered his two feet in a state of purification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The completion of the time period, and removing that which he has wiped upon nullify the wiping alone. So it is not permissible to wipe until he has performed the wudoo·, and washed his feet, and then worn it. However if he was still in a state of wudoo· when he took off the thing that he wiped over, or when the time period finished, then he remains upon his state of wudoo·. He can pray with it as he wishes until he breaks his wudoo·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wears two pairs of socks upon a state of purification, and then wipes over them, and then he removes the top one -after having wiped over it, then it is permissible for him to complete the time period by wiping over the underneath one, because it is correct that he entered his two feet into them in a state of being pure. But if he wore a sock, and wiped over it, and then he wore another one on top of it, then he may not wipe over that. This is because it will not be correct that he has entered the two of them when they were pure. [9]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PURIFICATION WITH EARTH (AT-TAYAMMUM):</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its Legislation:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He- the Most High- says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And if you are ill or upon a journey, or one of you comes from going to the toilet, or if you have had sexual intercourse with women and you do not find water, then perform tayammum with clean earth: and wipe your faces and your hands.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul-Maa.idah (5):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Clean earth is a purification for the Muslim even if he does not find water for ten years.”</strong> [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The causes which render it permissible:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to perform tayammum when one is unable to use water, if he can not find it, or if he fears harm from using- it because of illness in the body or severe cold. From `Imraan ibn Husayn -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “We were along with Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) on a journey. So he led the people in the Prayer and then he saw a man who was keeping himself away. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What prevented you from praying?” He said: “I was struck by janaabah and there was no water.” So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: “Use the earth, for it will suffice you.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Jaabir -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “We went out on a journey, so a man from us was struck by a rock and it caused him a head injury. Then he had a wet dream, so he asked his companions: ‘Do you find any concession for me to perform tayammum?’ So they said: “We do not find any concession for you and you, and you are able to use water.” So he took a bath and he died. So when we came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) he was informed of that. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They killed him, may Allaah kill them. Why didn’t they ask when they did not know? Indeed the cure for ignorance is to ask. It would have sufficed him to perform tayammum.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Amr ibn al-`Aas -radiyallaahu `anhu- that when he was sent on the military expedition of Dhaatas-Salaasil he said: “I had a wet dream on a night which was severely cold, so I feared that if I took a bath I would die. So I performed tayammum, and then I led my companions in the Dawn Prayer. Then when we came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they mentioned that to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O `Amr did you lead your companions in Prayer when you were junub?” So I said: “I remembered the Saying of Allaah- the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves indeed Allaah is ever Merciful to you.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore I performed tayammum and then I prayed.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) laughed, and he did not say anything.” [4]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">What is &#8216;earth&#8217; (as-Sa&#8217;eed)?</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in ‘Lisaanul `Arab’ [5] : “The Sa`eed is the earth; it is said: pure earth, and it is said: it is every pure soil; and there occurs in the Revelation sent down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So perform tayammum with pure earth&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul Maa·idah (5): 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Ishaaq said: ‘as-Sa`eed is the face of the earth, and it is upon the person that he should strike his two hands upon the face of the earth, and not care whether the place has soil upon it or not. Because as-Sa`eed is not soil rather it is the face of the earth, whether that be soil or something else. He said: and if there is a land which is all rock, with no soil upon it, and the person performing tayammum strikes his hand upon that rock, then that would be purification if he wipes his face with it.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The description of the tayammum:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Ammaar ibn Yaasir -radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)- who said: ‘I became junub and I did not find any water. Therefore I rolled around in the dust and I prayed. So I mentioned that to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and he said: “It would have sufficed you to do like this”, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) struck the ground with his two palms, and blew upon them. Then he wiped his face with them and his two hands.’ [6]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The principal with regard to tayammum is that it takes the place of the wudoo· So whatever is permissible to do in a state of wudoo·, then is permissible to do it with it (i.e. tayammum). And it is permissible to perform it before the time, just as that is permissible with the wudoo·; and the person can prayer whatever he wishes with it, just as he prays in a state of wudoo.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The things which break tayammum:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tayammum is broken by that which breaks the wudoo·. It is also broken by the presence of water -for the person who couldn’t find it, and the ability to use it- for the one who was unable to use it; and whatever came before from his Prayer is correct, it is not necessary for him to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “Two men went out on a journey and it became time for the Prayer and they did not have any water with them. So both of them performed tayammum with pure earth and they prayed. Then they found water within the time. So one of them repeated the wudoo· and the Prayer, and the other one did not repeat. Then they came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and they mentioned that to him. So he said to the one who had not repeated: “<strong>You attained the Sunnah, and your Prayer suffices you</strong>.” And he said to the one who performed wudoo· and repeated: “<strong>You have the reward twice over</strong>.”’’ [7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A point of benefit:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has a wound upon which he has wrapped a bandage, or a fracture which he has set, then having to wash that place falls away from him, and he does not have to wipe over it, nor perform tayammum for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for that is the Saying of Allaah- the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah does not place a duty on any soul except that which it can carry out.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2): 286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) <strong>“When I command you with a matter, then do what you are able to do from it.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything which the person is unable to do falls away, by the text of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and to declare something else to be a replacement for it is legislation, and legislation is not binding except by a text of the Qur&#8217;aan or Sunnah; and there is nothing in the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah to show that wiping upon a splint or upon ointment is a replacement for washing that which the person is not able to wash. So that saying falls away. [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The permissibility of performing tayammum with a wall: [10]</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Abbaas-radiyallaahu `anhu(maa)-who said: “ I came along with `Abdullaah ibn Yasaar- the slave belonging to Maymoonah the wife of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) until we entered upon Aboo Juhaym ibn al-Haarith ibn as-Simmah al-Ansaaree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Abul- Juhaym said: The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came from the direction of the well of Jamal [11], so he was met by a man who greeted him with Salaam, but the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) did not respond to him until he went to the wall, and wiped his face and two hands. Then he responded to his greeting of Salaam.” [12]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Saheeh: [Saheeh Sunan Abee Daawood (322); at-Tirmidhee (1/81/124), Aboo Daawood ( 1/528/329), anNasaa·ee (1/171)-with wordings which are close.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> [2]Agreed upon: al-Bukhaaree (1/477/344), Muslim (1/474/682), an-Nasaa·ee (1/171).</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> [3] Hasan: [Saheeh Sunan Abee Daawood (326)]; Aboo Daawood (1/532/332), and it contains an addition which is munkar, and that is “…and wipe or tie a piece of cloth upon his wound and then wipe over it. And wash the rest of his body.’’ Shamsul-Haqq said in ‘ `Awnul-Ma`bood’ (1/535): ‘The narration about combining tayammum and washing is not reported by anyone other than Zubayr ibn Khurayq, and he- along with the fact that he is not strong in hadeeth &#8211; has also contradicted the rest of those who report it from `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah. So the narration of the combination between tayammum and taking a bath is a narration which is weak, rulings cannot be established through it.’ And take note of the point of benefit which follows after one page.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The siwaak (tooth-stick) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The siwaak is recommended in all conditions, and its recommendation is emphasized:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1- Along with the wudoo·:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>If it were not that I would make a difficulty upon my nation I would have commanded them to use the siwaak with every wudoo</strong>·.&gt;&gt;” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2- At every Prayer:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah -radiyallaahu `anhu- from the Prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>If it were not that I would make a difficulty for my nation I would have commanded them to use the siwaak at every Prayer</strong>.&gt;&gt; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3- When reciting the Qur·aan:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “<strong>He commanded us to use the siwaak</strong>, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>When the servant stands in Prayer an Angel comes to him and stands behind him, listening to the Qur.aan and drawing closer. So he continues listening and drawing closer until he places his mouth upon his mouth. So he does not recite any Aayah except that it enters within the Angel</strong>&gt;&gt; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4- When entering the house:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al-Miqdaam ibn Shurayh: from his father, who said: I asked `Aa·ishah, saying: “<strong>What had the Prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to begin with when he entered his house?” </strong>she said:<strong> “With the siwaak.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5- When getting up (to pray) during the night:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Hudhayfah –radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “<strong>When Allaah’s Messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) got up to pray the tahajjud Prayer at night, he used to rub his mouth with the siwaak</strong>.” [5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; It is recommended for the person who wants to enter the toilet to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">بِسْمِ الله ) اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْخُبُثِ وَالْخَبَائِثِ)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Bismillaah),<br />
(Allaahummaa innee a`oodhu bika minal-khubuthi wal-khabaa·ith)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(With the name of Allaah),<br />
(O Allaah! I seek Your refuge from male and female devils).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because of the hadeeth of `Alee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The screen between the jinn and the private-parts of the descendants of Aadam, when one of you enters the toilet, is that he says:‘Bismillaah’ (with the name of Allaah).</strong>&gt;&gt; [1.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of the hadeeth of Anas -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) went to the toilet he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْخُبُثِ وَالْخَبَائِثِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaahummaa innee a`oodhu bika minal-khubuthi wal-khabaa·ith’ (O Allaah! I seek Your refuge from male and female devils).”  [1.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 &#8211; And it is recommended that when he departs he says:: (Ghufraanaka): (I seek Your forgiveness), because of the hadeeth of Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- who said: “When the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came away from the toilet he would say: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gh</span>ufraanaka</strong>&gt;&gt; (I seek Your forgiveness).” 1.3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; And it is recommended that he should enter with his left-foot first, and depart with the right-foot first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the right-side is used for noble actions, and the left-side for actions which are not noble actions; and there are reports which indicate this generally. [1.4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 &#8211; And if he is in an open place, then it is recommended for him to move far enough away so that he is not seen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “We went out along with Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) on a journey, and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) would not go to the toilet until he had gone far enough so that he would not be seen.” [1.5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; And it is recommended that he does not raise his garment until he is close to the ground:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn `Umar -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- : “That when the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) wanted to relieve himself he would not raise his garment until he was close to the ground.” [2.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 &#8211; And it is not permissible to face or to have ones back towards the qiblah, whether in the open desert or within a building:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Ayyoob al-Ansaaree -radiyallaahu `anhu- from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When you go to the toilet, then do not face the qiblah and do not have your back towards it, but rather turn to the east or to the west</strong>.” [2.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Ayyoob said: “So we came to Shaam, and we found toilets which had been built facing towards the Ka`bah. So we would turn aside from it, and we would ask for the forgiveness of Allaah -the Most High.” [2.3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 &#8211; And it is forbidden to go to the toilet upon the path-way of the people, and in the places where they take shade:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Beware of the two things which bring about curses</strong>.&gt;&gt; They said: “And what are the two things which bring about curses, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: &lt;&lt;<strong>The person who goes to the toilet upon the path-way of the people, or where they take shade</strong>.&gt;&gt;2.4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 &#8211; And it is disliked to urinate in the place where he takes a bath: From Humayd al-Himyaree who said: I met a man who had accompanied the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) just as Aboo Hurayrah accompanied him, [2.5] who said: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) forbade that one of us should comb his hair every day, and that he should urinate in the place where he takes a bath.”  [2.6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 &#8211; And it is forbidden to urinate in standing water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir: from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) that he forbade urinating in standing water. [3.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 &#8211; And it is permissible to urinate standing, but sitting is better:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Hudhayfah -radiyallaahu `anhu-: that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the rubbish dump of a people, and he urinated whilst standing. So I moved away, so he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Draw near</strong>.&gt;&gt; So I drew close to him, until I stood at his heels. So he performed wudoo·, and wiped over his leather socks. [3.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we said that sitting is better because that was his usual practice, to such an extent that `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- said: “Whoever narrates to you that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) urinated whilst standing then do not believe him. He had not used to urinate except whilst sitting.” [3.3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this saying of hers does not negate what occurs from Hudhayfah, since she informed about what she had seen, and Hudhayfah informed about what he had seen; and, as is known, the one who affirms is given precedence over the one who negates, since he has additional knowledge with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 &#8211; And it is obligatory to keep oneself clean of urine:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- : that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) passed by two graves, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>They are being punished, and they are not being punished for something serious. As for one of them, then he had not used to keep himself clean of his urine; and as for the other, then he used to go between the people with reports to cause trouble (nameemah)</strong>.” [3.4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12-And he should not hold his penis with his right hand whilst he is urinating, nor clean himself with it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qataadah -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When one of you urinates, let him not hold his penis with his right hand; and let him not clean himself with his right hand</strong>.” [4.1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 &#8211; And it is permissible to clean oneself with water, or with stones-or with whatever is like them, and water is better:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to enter the toilet, and I and a boy of similar age to me used to carry a pot of water and a spear. So he would clean himself with the water.” [4.2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa- that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>When one of you goes to the toilet then let him take three stones along with him, and let him clean himself with them, since they will suffice him</strong>.&gt;&gt;  [4.3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 &#8211; And it is not permissible to suffice with less than three stones:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Salmaan al-Faarisee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that it was said to him: ‘Your Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has taught you everything, even how to use the toilet!’ So he said: “Yes indeed! He <strong>forbade</strong> us from facing the qiblah with excrement or urine; and that we should clean ourselves with the right hand, and that we should clean ourselves with less than three stones; and that we should clean ourselves with a piece of animal dung or with a bone.” [4.4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 &#8211; And it is not permissible to clean oneself with a bone, or with a piece of dung: From Jaabir -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: “The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) forbade that a person should wipe himself clean with a bone or a piece of animal dung.” [4.5]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Book of Purification</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Second Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurayrah (May Allaah be pleased with him): Allaah&#8217;s Apostle (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The prayer of a person who does hadath (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs (repeats) the ablution.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4, Number 137 and Sahih Muslim Kitaab at-Taharah #559]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Narrator</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator is Abu Hurayrah (radiyallaahu ‘anhu). His name is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Sakhir ad-Dawsee. He accepted Islaam in the year of the battle of Khaybar (6 AH), and he witnessed the battle. He was in the company of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), and was very much interested in the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), testified to Abu Hurayrah’s keenness regarding the hadeeths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar (May Allaah be pleased with him and his father) said: <em>“You were closest to the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), being with him, and most knowledgeable in hadeeth”</em>. The same had been reported from ‘Umar (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam al- Bukhaaree (rahimahullaah) said: <em>“Abu Hurayrah was the most diligent one in preserving the narrations of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), in his time”</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge related that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated 5,374 hadeeths. He died in the year 57 AH in the city of Madeenah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is “The ruling concerning salaah without wudhuu’”. In this hadeeth it is clear that the importance of salaah ranks high with Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa), because it is the best of worship after the shahaadah. And it is the relation between the slave and his Lord. And for this reason, the believer is not permitted to indulge in the salaah until he is pure, as this hadeeth illustrates. So Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa), does not accept the salaah of the slave and will not reward him for it if he breaks the wudhuu’ until he repeats the ablution.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The hadeeth tells that from the salaah, there is the salaah which is accepted and the salaah which is rejected. The salaah which is in accordance with the shari’ah is accepted. And the salaah which is in opposition to the shari’ah is rejected. This applies to all types of worship, because the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam) said: “Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our matter, then it is rejected.” [Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim]. So it must comply with the shari’ah to be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whether the salaah is an obligatory one or an optional one (even the salaatul-janaazah i.e. funeral prayer), it is not accepted if the person performs it while in a state of ritual impurity, even if he forgets being in such a state. It is only accepted when he repeats the wudhuu’. Similarly, the salaah of one in a state of sexual defilement is not accepted if he performs the salaah before taking the ghusl – the complete bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The salaah of the muhdith (the one in a state of ritual impurity), is forbidden until he makes the wudhuu’, because Allaah does not accept it. And offering means of nearness to Allaah, knowing that Allaah does not accept them, is like mocking at Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If a person makes wudhuu’ to perform a certain salaah then the second salaah approaches and he attains the time of the second salaah while in a state of purity then it is not an obligation on him to redo the wudhuu’. He or she can pray on the same wudhuu’ done for the previous salaah. And this is very important because some people think that it is an obligation to make wudhuu’ for each salaah. It is not an obligation as long as the state of wudhuu’ is maintained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Ritual purity is a condition for the correctness and acceptance of the salaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Breaking the wudhuu’ during salaah invalidates the salaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The invalidators of wudhuu’ are:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. Responding to the call of nature or passing wind</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. Intoxication, unconsciousness, deep sleep and insanity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c. Touching the genitals skin to skin, and some scholars conditioned that it must be with a sexual desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d. Sexual activity which necessitates a ghusl</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e. Eating camel’s meat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f. Apostasy (ar-Ridda)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g. Washing a dead body or carrying it. There is a difference of opinion on this, but to be on the precautionary side, one does that. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He who washes the dead let him take a bath, and he who carries the dead let him make wudhuu’.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ahmed, Abu Daawood and at-Tirmidhee, and Al-Albani graded it as saheeh as in saheeh sunan Abi Daeeod, 2:609)].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Questions for this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the full name of Abu Hurayrah?<br />
2. When did he accept Islaam?<br />
3. How many Hadeeths did he report?<br />
4. When did he die?<br />
5. If someone prayed without having wudhuu’ due to forgetfulness, is his salaah acceptable or not?<br />
6. Is it a must to have (make) wudhuu’ for each salaah?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection. This is a continuation of the explanation of <em>The Basic Rulings and Principles of Fiqh – The Beneficial, Eloquent Classifications and Differentiations</em> by Imaam ‘Abd ar-Rahman bin Naasir as-Sa’di (rahimahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Foundation eleven is entitled:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The asl (i.e. previous state or condition) remains in effect, and certainty is not annulled by mere doubt.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>This great foundation covers many matters including:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Acts of worship<br />
2) <em>Salaah</em> (prayer)<br />
3) <em>Zakaah</em><br />
4) Fasting<br />
5) Hajj<br />
6) <em>Nikaah</em> (marriage)<br />
7) Divorce</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Evidence for Foundation 11</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This foundation is established on the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> from ‘Abbaad bin Tamim ( radiyallaahu ‘anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“My uncle (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) asked Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the <em>salaah</em>. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>He should not leave his salaah unless he hears sound or smells something.</em>’”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the person should not discontinue his prayer due to mere doubt. He should only leave when he is certain he has invalidated his state of purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A person makes <em>wudhu</em> and later doubts whether he performed an act that would nullify it. In such a situation, the <em>asl</em> is the existence and continuity of purity. The fact that he thinks he may have done a ritual impurity is not to be considered as in origin, the person was in a state of purity. <strong>Certainty is never annulled except by certainty; it can never be annulled by mere doubt.</strong> Rather, it is strange that some people when they have doubts, they experience whispering which drives them to remove the doubt with certainty by intentionally invalidating their <em>wudhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) A person was certain that he was in a state of ritual impurity. Later, he doubts whether he made <em>wudhu</em>. In this case, the <em>asl</em> is that the state of ritual impurity remains in effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the <em>asl</em> remains, and it does not cease except when there is certainty that renders it annulled.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Doubt in the Purity of an Object</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purity (<em>at-tahaarah</em>) is the origin of things (e.g. water, clothing, etc.); whenever someone doubts the purity of something, then he builds upon the <em>asl</em> that it is pure. For instance, if some water from a drain falls on him or he steps in moisture, then the origin is that this water is pure. However, if someone is sure filth has fallen on his garment but later doubts whether he washed it, then the <em>asl</em> is that the ritual impurity remains.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt in the Number of Completed <em>Rakaah</em> in <em>Salaah</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In <em>salaah</em>, a person may doubt exactly how many <em>rakaah</em> he has performed. Such situations are divided into two categories: preponderance and total doubt. For example, if someone doubts how many <em>rakaah</em> he has already prayed (e.g. three or four units) but preponderates a certain number, then he builds on that preponderance and later makes two prostrations of forgetfulness (<em>sujuud as-sahw</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for relying on preponderance came in the <em>sunnah</em> from the <em>hadeeth</em> of Abdullaah bin Masood (radhi Allaahu anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) prayed [and the subnarrator Ibrahim (rahimahullaah) said, ‘I do not know whether he prayed more or less than usual’], and when he had finished the prayers he was asked, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Has there been any change in the prayers?’ He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, <em>‘What is it?&#8217;</em> The people said, ‘You have prayed so much and so much.’ So the Prophet bent his legs, faced the <em>qiblah</em> and performed two prostrations (of <em>sahw</em>) and finished his prayers with <em>tasleem</em> (by turning his face to the right and left saying: <em>&#8216;As-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaah’</em>). When he turned his face to us, he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, <em>‘If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I would have informed you, but I am a human being like you and liable to forget like you. So if I forget, remind me and if anyone of you is doubtful about his prayer, he should follow what he thinks to be correct (falyataharra as-sawab) and complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two prostrations (of sahw).’”</em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, when a person is in total doubt concerning how many <em>rakaah</em> he has already completed (e.g. two or three), then he builds upon certainty which is the lesser number; he then makes <em>sujuud as-sahw.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A person is unsure whether he prayed three or four <em>rakaah</em> and is unable to determine which is more likely. He should therefore build on certainty which is the lesser number (i.e. three) and make <em>sujuud as-sahw</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) A person is not certain whether he prayed three or four <em>rakaah</em> but preponderates that he prayed four. He should therefore build on the preponderance (i.e. four <em>rakaah</em>) and make <em>sujuud as-sahw</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, preponderance is used to determine the number of completed rounds in <strong><em>tawaaf</em> </strong>and walks in <em>saa’ee</em> between Safa and Marwah. For instance, if a person is in total doubt as to whether he completed six or seven walks in <em>saa’ee</em>, then he builds on certainty and considers it to be as if he made six trips. Similarly, if he is able to preponderate that it is the sixth walk, then he should consider it the sixth and bring the seventh. However, there is no <em>sujuud as-sahw</em> legislated for <em>tawaaf</em> or <em>saa’ee</em> given the weakness of the narration from ibn ‘Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) that the <em>tawaaf</em> is salaah. This foundation also is applicable to washing a utensil seven times after a dog has licked it. If someone is entirely unsure whether he washed it three or four times, then he builds upon certainty, but if he is able to preponderate, then he builds upon that.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt in the Number of Missed Prayers and Fasts</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When making up missed prayers or days of fasting, the person builds on certainty. However, this can be problematic. For instance, someone is unsure whether he broke his fast three or four days in Ramadan. In principle, he is certain he broke it at least three times. However, this origin is opposed by another <em>asl</em>, which is the obligation to fulfill that which is binding upon one’s self. This can not be attained except by fasting four days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if someone does not know if he missed five <em>salaah</em> or six, then in origin he certainly missed at least five, but this is in opposition to the obligation to free one’s responsibility. This can not be fulfilled except by performing six. In this case, he brings that which is higher.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt Concerning which Specific Prayer was Missed</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone knows that he missed one <em>salaah</em> on a given day but does not remember which prayer (e.g. <em>duhr</em>, ‘<em>asr</em>, etc.), then there are the following opinions concerning that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The person should pray all five prayers because it is possible the missed salaah is any one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) He should pray one <em>salaah</em> with four rakaah, another <em>salaah</em> with three <em>rakaah</em>, and one <em>salaah</em> of two <em>rakaah</em>. This is because the <em>salaah</em> of four <em>rakaah</em> would cover for <em>duhr</em>, ‘<em>asr</em>, and <em>isha</em>’ while the other two <em>salaah</em> would cover for <em>maghrib</em> and <em>fajr</em> respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Our Shaykh, Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said, “He should exert the effort until he preponderates which is the correct one.” If the person sincerely attempts to recall which <em>salaah</em> he missed, Allaah (<em>subhaanallaahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) will let him remember.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Doubt in Divorce</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many different situations in which doubt in divorce can occur. They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A person doubts whether he uttered the statement of divorce at all. In this situation, the asl is that he did not say it, and the couple is still married. This is because the marriage is certain and is not annulled by mere doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) If someone doubts whether he conditioned the divorce on something, then the asl is that the divorce is unconditional.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Someone conditions his divorce on some matter. Later, he doubts whether the condition was fulfilled. The origin therefore is that it did not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) A person divorced his wife but is uncertain how many times he uttered the statement (i.e. once, twice or thrice). The asl is that he said it once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) A man has two wives (for example Hind and Fatimah), and he doubts which of his wives he uttered the divorce concerning. This matter should be decided by drawing lots. If the lot came on Fatimah, then she is divorced, and Hind remains his wife. If he later remembers he actually divorced Hind or found a paper documenting that, then he leaves Hind and returns Fatimah as long as the drawing of the lots and the accompanying decree was not issued by a judge (if it was performed by a judge, then it would be classified as the judge’s direct ruling). However, if Fatimah got married to someone else in the meantime, then the husband can not return Fatimah because she is now the right of her new husband unless he brings proof, such as a document with testimony, that the divorce was for Hind; in this case, Fatimah can return to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) A person doubts whether his wife finished her waiting period. The asl is that she has not finished it and is still in her ‘iddah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt in Suckling</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning suckling, doubts affect whether or not there is prohibition (<em>tahreem</em>) to marry the wet nurse and her daughters. Cases include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Doubt exists concerning whether a particular child nursed from a woman at all. The asl in this situation is that he did not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Someone doubts whether he suckled from a woman five times or less than that. This person builds upon certainty, which is that he suckled on less than five occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) There is doubt around when a child suckled from a wet nurse. In this matter, the scholars have two opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. Some scholars hold that for <em>tahreem</em> to exist, the child must have suckled within the first two years. If there is doubt as to whether a child suckled from a woman within the first two years, then in principle the asl would be that he suckled within that period, which would entail <em>tahreem</em>. However, the scholars have explained that since this <em>asl</em> leads to tahreem, the origin is that there is no forbiddance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. Other scholars have mentioned that the condition for <em>tahreem</em> is whether the child suckled before or after weaning. If there is doubt as to whether the child suckled before or after weaning, then in principle the <em>asl</em> would be before weaning. However, just as with the other opinion, the scholars have explained that in origin there is actually no forbiddance in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, with either opinion, there is no tahreem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) A mother is certain that a woman in a particular household nursed her child but is unsure as to which specific woman did it. In this case, the tahreem is upon all of the women in the household. For example, if there are two women in that house, then both women and their daughters are haraam for him to marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) A woman is certain that she nursed a child in a particular household but is unsure as to which child. Therefore, it is as if she nursed all of them. Hence, all of the boys of this house are prohibited from marrying her as well as her daughters, and they become mahaarim (pl. of mahram) for her and her daughters.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Doubt in the Hunting of Game</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is hunting game, doubt can exist concerning whether the animal was killed by his shot or some other cause. Such situations are divided into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) No cause is found for the death of the animal other than the shot. Therefore, the meat is halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone says the basmalah and shoots an animal. He later finds the animal dead with no sign of another cause for its death. As such, the asl is the nonexistence of another cause, which makes the meat halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Another cause is found for the animal’s death that is equally or close to equally as likely as the shot to have killed it. Therefore, the meat of the animal is haraam. This is proven by the hadeeth of Adi bin Hatim (radhi Allaahu anhu) that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#333300;"><em>When you set off your dog, recite the name of Allaah, and if it catches (game for you) and you find it alive, then slaughter it. If you find it dead and that (your dog) has eaten nothing out of that, (even then) you may eat it, but if you find along with your dog another dog and a kill has been made, then do not eat, for you do not know which of the two has killed it. And if you shoot your arrow, recite the name of Allaah, but if it (game) goes out of your sight for a day and you do not find on that but the mark of your arrow, then eat that it you so like, but if you find it drowned in water, then do not eat that.”</em></span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A person shot an animal, but the shot did not kill it immediately. The animal was later found dead in a pool of water. It can not be known whether the shot killed the animal or it drowned. Thus, as proven by the hadeeth of Adi (radhi Allaahu anhu), this meat is forbidden.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under this foundation many matters fall; anyone that studies <em>fiqh</em> will surely be benefited by it and will be better able to relate matters to their principles and origins. In summary, the continuity of the <em>asl</em> remains whenever the existence of a cause to nullify it is doubted. Similarly, in every matter where there is a doubt about the number, we build on preponderance, and if there is no preponderance, then we build on certainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh foundation in Imaam ‘Abd ar-Rahman bin Naasir as-Sa’di’s book, al- Qawaa&#8217;id wal-Usool al-Jaami&#8217;ah wal-Furooq wat-Taqaaseem al-Badee&#8217;ah an- Naafi&#8217;ah (The Basic Rulings and Principles of Fiqh – The Beneficial, Eloquent Classifications and Differentiations), is entitled:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The asl remains in effect, and certainty is not annulled by mere doubt.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uthman ibn ‘Affaan, al- Hasan ibn ‘Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, ‘Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak, ‘Abdullaah ibn al Haarith, Abu Ya’laa, Abul Ahwas, Ash-Sha’bee, Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn ‘Umar in a narration, and Abu Hanifah, Maalik, Ahmad, and the Shafi’ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is permissible after both wudoo and ghusl to dry the body-parts</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And their evidence is what ‘Aa’ishah (radhiAllaahu ‘anhaa) reports – she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rasoolullah (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) had a cloth which he used to dry himself with after making wudoo . </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be da’eef]. Then al Ainee states that an-Nasaa’ee records it in ‘al-Kunaa’ with saheeh isnaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it. (See Fiqh al-Imam Sa’eed, 1/70). Al-Albaanee declares the hadeeth to be hasan. (Saheeh ul Jaami’, 4706).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped his face with it. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.468)]. In az-Zawaa’id it is said: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In its isnaad is al-Wadeen ibn ‘Ataa who is sadooq but has a bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says in ‘Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb’, so its isnaad is da’eef!! – but it is strengthened by the previous hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah to the level of hasan – and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after Purification and their proof is:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu’anhaa) who described the Prophet’s (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) ghusl from Janaabah and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it.</strong> </span>[Al-Bukhaaree, and Muslim – and the word is his].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Final word: Is that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Drying the body-parts is one of the desirable actions as shown by the hadeeth of Aa’ishah (radhiAllaahu ‘anhaa) – as for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu ‘anhaa) “but he refused it” does not amount to the fact that it is makrooh – and Allaah Knows best.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is a woman that is menstruating or in her post-partum period allowed to touch the mus-haf or read from it? Also, is the menstruating woman allowed to enter the masjid in order to gain religious knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abdulazeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The menstruating woman is not allowed to sit in the masjid nor touch the mus-haf until she has become purified. However, if a need for her to touch it arose, such as in order to revise a verse (of the Qur&#8217;an) or something like that, there is no problem to do so by wearing gloves or by using some other barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for touching it without some sort of barrier, then no, she should not do that. This is because her impurity is major, like the one who is impure due to sexual relations (junub). The one who is &#8216;junub&#8217; does not read or touch the mus-haf. As for the menstruating woman, she may recite [the Qur&#8217;an] during the whole period. So can the one in her post-partum period, according to the correct Opinion. She can read from her memory without touching the mus-haf unless she has to in order to revise a verse in which case it is alright if she touches it using a barrier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. 504. After completing his &#8216;Umrah, a man found some filth in his Ihram garments; what is the ruling on this?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. If a person performed Tawaf and Say for &#8216;Umrah, and after that, he found some filth in his Ihram garments, then his Tawaf is valid, his Say is valid and his &#8216;Umrah is valid. This is because if a person has some filth on his garment, and he does not know about it, or he knew about it but he forgot to wash it, and then he prayed in that garment, then his prayer is valid. Similarly, if he made Tawaf in this garment, then his Tawaf is valid. The evidence for that is the Saying of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error&#8221;</strong> [Al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This evidence is general, and it is considered a great rule from among the rules of Islamic Law. There is a specific evidence in the matter, and that is that one day, the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) led his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, in prayer and it was his practice to pray in his shoes, but he removed his shoes and the people removed their shoes too. After he had finished praying, he said to them: What was wrong with you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8220;We saw you removing your shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;Jibril came to me and informed me that there was something harmful or some dirt on them&#8221;  [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, some impurity. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not repeat the prayer, even though at the beginning of his prayer, he had worn shoes on which there was some impurity. This proves that if a person prayed in a garment in which there was impurity due to forgetfulness or ignorance, his prayer is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a question here: If a person eats camel meat and he stands up and prays without performing ablution, believing that he had eaten mutton, should he repeat his prayer if he found out? We say: He should repeat the prayer after performing ablution. If someone asked: Why do you say that a person who prayed in a polluted garment due to ignorance should not repeat the prayer, while one who eats camel meat due to ignorance, should repeat it? We say: Because we have a useful and important rule, which is, commands are not cancelled due to ignorance or forgetfulness, whereas prohibitions are cancelled due to ignorance and forgetfulness. The evidence for this rule is the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever slept through a prayer or forgot it, he must offer it as soon as he remembers it.&#8221;</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he made the Taslim after performing two Rak&#8217;at in one of his afternoon prayers and he forgot the remainder of the prayer, he completed it when he remembered it. This is an evidence that those things which are commanded are not cancelled due to forgetfulness, because the Prophet ordered the one who forgot his prayer to offer it as soon as he remembers it, and the obligation to pray it was not removed due to forgetfulness. Also, he completed the prayer and he did not cancel the remainder of it due to forgetfulness. The proof that commands are not cancelled due to ignorance, is that a man came and offered a prayer in which he was not at rest, then he came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and greeted him and he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeated it three times and the man kept praying and coming to him, but he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer, for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) taught him to pray correctly. So,this man abandoned an obligatory act due to ignorance, because he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot pray better than this, so teach me.&#8221; If an obligation was cancelled due to ignorance, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have excused him; and this rule is important and beneficial for the seeker of knowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muslim -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; [The Book of Purification]: (no.234): “Muhammad ibn Haatim ibn Maymoon narrated to me: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us: Mu`aawiyah ibn Saalih narrated to us: from Rabee`ah -meaning Ibn Yazeed: from Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee: from `Uqbah ibn `Aamir; And Aboo `Uthmaan narrated to me: from Jubayr ibn Nufayr: from `Uqbah ibn `Aamir, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We were tending camels, and my turn came, so I brought them back in the evening. So then I found Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) standing, speaking to the people, and I caught from what he was saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;There is not one of you who performs the wudoo·, and he performs the wudoo· well, and then he stands and prays two rak`ahs, turning his full attention to them with his heart and his face, except that Paradise will be binding for him&gt;&gt;.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So I said: &#8216;How fine this is!&#8217; So then someone in front of me said: “That which came before it was even finer.” So I looked, and it was `Umar. He said: “I saw that you came just now. So he had (already) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;There is not one of you who performs the wudoo·, and he performs the wudoo· completely -or: and he performs it fully, then he says:</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Sick person is required to purify himself with water, performing ablution from minor impurity and <i>Ghusl</i> from major impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he is unable to purify himself using water, due to weakness or fear of increasing his illness, or delaying his recovery, then he may perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The way to perform <i>Tayammum</i> is to strike the clean earth with his hands once, then wipe his whole face with them, then wipe his hands, one with the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If he is unable to purify himself, the another person should assist him in making the ablution, or performing the <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. If a certain part of the body which is to be purified is afflicted by a wound, he should wash it with water; but if washing it with water will cause harm to him, then he may wet his hand with water and then wipe over it. If wiping over it may also cause harm he may perform <i>Tayammum</i> for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If he has a severe fracture in any of his limbs, which is covered with a dressing or cast, he may wipe over it with water, instead of washing it, and it does not require <i>Tayammum</i>, because the wiping takes the place of washing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is permisable to make <i>Tayammum</i> using a wall, or anything else which is clean and contains dust. If the wall is covered with anything which is not from th earth such as paint, then one should not make <i>Tayammum</i> with it, unless there is dust over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. If the <i>Tayammum</i> is not made on the earth or a wall or anything else containing dust, there is no objection to the collecting of dust in container or a hankerchief, in order to make <i>Tayammum</i> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. If a person performs <i>Tayammum</i> for prayer, and remains in a purified state until the time of the next prayer, then he may pray with the <i>Tayammum</i> he made before and he does not need to repeat it for the second prayer, since he remains purified and nothing has invalidated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. The sick person is obliged to cleanse his body from all manner of impurity, but if he is unable to do so, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 The sick person is required to pray in clean clothes, and if they became soiled, they must be cleaned or replaced with clean ones. If this is not possible, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The sick person is obliged to pray upon something clean and if it becomes soiled, he must wash it, change for something clean or cover it with something clean. If he is unable to do so, he may pray there, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. It is not permissible for the invalid to delay the prayer due to his inability to achieve purification; rather, he should purify himself as much as he is able, then perform the prayer on time, even if there is some impurity on his body, his clothes or his place of prayer, which he is unable to remove.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the Lords of the Worlds, and may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions. As for what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has legislated purification for every prayer, because the elimination of impurity and the removal of pollution &#8211; whether on the body, the clothes or the place of prayer &#8211; are two of the conditions of prayer. So when the Muslim wishes to pray, he must perform the well known ablution <i>(Wudhu)</i> to purify himself from minor impurity, or make Ghusl if the impurity is of the major kind. And before making ablution, <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> must be performed with water, or <i>Istijmar</i> by the one who has urinated or defecated in order that the purification and cleansing be complete. What follows is an explanation of some of the rulings related to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water is obligatory every time something is discharged from the bowel and bladder, such as urine or faeces. But it is not necessary for the sleeper or one who passes wind to perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>. He is only required to perform ablution, because <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>is only prescribed for the removal of impurity, and there is no impurity in this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istijmar</i> is performed using stones, or another material in its place (such as wood, paper etc.) It must consist of three clean stones, as proved by the Hadith of the Prophet<i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> which states that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it </i><i>Witr</i> (i.e. use an odd number of stones).&#8221;</span> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If any of you goes to defecate, he should take with him three stones, for they will be sufficient for him.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated that he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> forbade <i>Istijmar</i> with less than three stones. It is not permissible to make <i>Istijmar</i> with animal droppings, bones or food or anything which contains some forbidden material. It is preferred for a person to perform <i>istijmar</i> with stones, or the like such as tissues etc. After which, he should use water, because the stones remove the essence of the pollution, but the water purifies the area and is therefore more thorough. A person has a choice of <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water, or<i>Istijmar</i> with stones or the like. It is reported on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The Prophet </i><i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> entered the toilet and I and a young boy like me carried materials, including water and <i>&#8216;anaza</i> (a short spear) and he would perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the water.&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari no.152 &amp; Muslim no.271.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of &#8216;Aishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, that she said to a group of women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Order your husbands to clean themselves following defecation with water, for I am too embarrassed to do so, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></em> At-Tirmidhee said that it was authentic [At-Tirmidhee no.19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wants to use only one of them (i.e. stones or water), it is preferred to choose water, because it cleans the area removing the essence and the traces and it is more thorough in cleansing. If he chooses to only use stones, he should content himself with three, if it cleanses the area, but if it is not enough, he may use four or five (or more) until he has cleaned the area, but it is better to finish with an odd number, based upon the saying of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it Witr.&#8221;</span></em> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissable to make the <i>Istijmar</i> with the right hand, according to the <i>Hadith</i> of Salman, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah forbade us from performing <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the right hand.&#8221; And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you should hold his penis in his right hand while he is urinating. nor should he wipe himself with the right hand after answering the call of nature.&#8221;</span> </i>[Al-Bukhari no.153 &amp; Muslim no.267]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if his left hand has been cut off, or is broken or there is some disease in it, he may use his right hand, and there is no objection to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Islamic law is based upon facility and ease, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has lightened the burden of worship on those who have some excuse, according to the excuse. He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you can.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukharino.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Religion is ease.&#8221;</i> </span>[Narrated by al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a sick person is unable to cleanse himself of minor impurity with the water by making ablution, or he is unable to purify himself of major impurity by making <i>Ghusl</i>, due to weakness, or fear of making his illness worse, or delaying his recovery, he may perform<i>Tayammum</i> [Dry ablution using sand or dust.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by striking his hands in clean dust once, then wiping his face with the palms of his hands and his fingers slowly, based upon the Words of Him, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform <i>Tayammum</i> with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nisa 4:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling on those who are unable to use water is the same that of those who are unable to find water, according to the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no. 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person may fall into one of a number of categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If his illness is a simple one and he does not fear to use the water, such as an ailment from which there is no fear that using the water will delay his recovery, or increase his pain, or cause any infection, such as a headache, toothache and the like, or he is able to use warm water without harm, then it is not allowed for him to make <i>Tayammum</i>. Because the permission to perform it is in order to prevent harm, and there is no fear of harm to him, and because he can find water, therefore he must use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he fears from an illness which he fears may &#8211; should he use water &#8211; cause his death or harm one of his organs, or may lead to some illness which might cause his death or harm one of his organs, or cause the loss of some faculty, then it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the words of the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you.&#8221;</b>[Surah an-Nisa&#8217; 4:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is suffering from some illness which makes him unable to move, and he finds no one to bring him water, it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Anyone suffering from a wound, an ulcer or fracture, or any illness which will be exacerbated by using water, and who becomes <i>Junub</i> [in a state of sexual impurity] is allowed to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the above evidences. If he is able to wash the healthy areas of his body, he must do so and make <i>Tayammum</i> for the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person who is in a place in which he finds neither water nor dust, or anyone who can bring him either one of them, may pray whatever condition he is in, and he is not allowed to delay the prayer, as Allaah, the Most High say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An invalid afflicted with incontinence of urine, who is not cured by his treatment, must make ablution for every prayer after the start of its prescribed time, wash off any urine that has affected his body, and wear a clean garment for his prayer, if this is not a burden on him. But if it is, he is excused from it, based upon the Allaah Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you cable.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must try to the best of his ability to prevent the spread of the urine to his clothes, or his body, or the place in which he will pray. And everything that invalidates ablution also invalidates <i>Tayammum</i>, and in addition, the ability to use water or its presence. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (May Allaah be pleased with him), that Allaah&#8217;s Apostle (<em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If anyone of you performs ablution he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers. And whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands three times before putting them in the water for ablution, because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration by Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Let him take water into his nose, washing the nose by putting water in it”. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And he who makes ablution, then let him take water into his nose.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4, Number 163]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p>The narrator is Abu Hurayrah and some aspects of his biography have already been mentioned in hadeeth number two.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is explaining and making known some types of purification. The meanings of some of the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•<em> Ithaa tawadhdha’a</em> means“ If he starts his <em>wudhuu</em>’”<br />• <em>Wudhuu</em>’ means “ablution”<br />• <em>Anf</em> means “nose”<br />• <em>Istijmar</em> means “cleaning the private parts with stones.”<br />• <em>Istinshaq</em> means “drawing water into the nose.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The overall meaning is that it is from the completion of Shari’ah and its care and concerns regarding purification, that it comprehensively dealt with the types of purification needed to complete such act of worship (the ablution). In this hadeeth, The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam</em>) spoke about three types of perfection of <em>taharah</em> and taking the precautionary measures regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Completing the <em>taharah</em> of the face in <em>wudhuu</em>’ by making <em>istinshaq</em> (drawing the water into the nose).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person does this by himself; draws the water into the nose then blows it out to clean what’s therein.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In the <em>istijmar</em> (the cleansing of the private parts), this is to remove what comes out from these parts and from the perfection of this is that the person does this with odd numbers. So if it cleans the place by three times of cleansing then he holds. And if the place is cleansed by four times usage of the stones then he increases a fifth one in order to attain the <em>witr</em> – the odd number- and this is like many matters in Shari’ah that end up with <em>witr</em> – the odd number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Concerns the washing of the hands after waking from sleep before immersing it in the water for ablution. The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam</em>) commanded that this be done three times..</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Seeking to wash the inside of the nose and to clean it by blowing the water out is done before the washing of the face. It is from the completion of the face washing and therefore it is an obligation like the obligation of washing the face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Seeking to disconnect the <em>istijmar</em> upon <em>witr</em> (the odd number) is done even if the cleansing takes place with even steps. What is obligatory is the cleansing, and the odd number is added as the perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Seeking to wash the hands, of the person upon waking up, three times before immersing them in the utensil of water for ablution, or any utensil containing water or the like of liquids. The wisdom is that the person does not know where his hands were during sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The good way of teaching by the Prophet (<em>`alayhi salaatu was-salaam</em>), where he linked the ruling to its wisdom so that the legally responsible person increases his eemaan by knowing the wisdom. Through this, the perfection of the Sharia’ah is manifested and its signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The comprehensibility and perfect state of the Shari’ah where it dealt with and gave high attention to the matters of purification and also taking precaution in these matters.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Narrators</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibnu-l’Aas ibn Waa’il al-Qurayshi. He was a devout worshipper, memorizing narrations from the Prophet (`alayhi salaatu wassalaam), but limited are the narrations from him. His narrations were not as many as those reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with all of them), because he was a worshipper utilising much of his time in worship. As to his date of death; there is differences among the historians as to when and where did he die. It is reported from Imaam Ahmad, that he died at the end of Dhul-Hijjah the year 63 AH (may Allaah be please with him).</p>
<p>Abu Hurayrah was spoken about earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aa’ishah, Ummul-Mu’mineen (the mother of the believers), the daughter of Abi Bakr ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Uthman ibn ‘Aamir al-Qurayshi at-Taymee (may Allaah be pleased with her and her father), was born in Islaam and the Prophet (`alayhi salaatu was-salaam) married her in Makkah following the death of Khadeejah and before his marriage to Sawdah. The marriage contract was done when she was six and the commencement of the marriage took place in Madeenah when she was nine. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) died when she was eighteen years of age. The marriage of ‘Aa’ishah in knowledge and wisdom and understanding is well known. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) spoke about her saying: “The merits of ‘Aa’ishah and her excellence over the rest of women is like the excellence of ath-Thareed (a meat dish) over the rest of food. [Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many used to consult with her concerning aspects of knowledge. She died in the city of Madeenah in the month of Ramadaan 58 years AH, after a life spent propagating much knowledge that benefited the Ummah. May Allaah be pleased with her.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Subject and Overall Explanation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is improperly performing wudhuu’. As to the meanings of some of the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• waylun : This is a threat (wa’eed). And it is said that this could be a valley in Hellfire, and the other opinion is that it means punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Al-a’qaab &#8211; The plural of‘ aqib (heel). This refers to the heels which were left not completely wet in wudhuu’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The overall meaning is that since taharah (purification) is one of the greatest and most important conditions for salaah, improperly doing it will take away from the salaah. That is why the Prophet (`alayhi salaatu was-salaam) warned against incompletion or improperly making the purification to the degree that he gave such a threat regarding improper handling of one of the parts upon which wudhuu’ is to be made; a threat of Punishment in Hell on that particular part. Why did the Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) particularize the heels as the part? This is because it was the place where the wudhuu’ on it was not completed as in the hadeeth referring to this incident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the version reported by &#8216;Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr he said: “We returned from Makkah to Madeenah with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), and when we came to some water on the way, some of the people were in a hurry at the time of the afternoon prayer and performed ablution hurriedly; and when we reached them, their heels were dry, no water had touched them. The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: ‘Woe to (dry) heels, because of Hell-fire. Make your ablution thorough’.” [Muslim]. In another narration also by &#8216;Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) lagged behind us on a journey. We travelled (back) and we took him; and then came the time of the afternoon prayer, and as we were going to wipe our feet he (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called out: ‘Woe to the heels because of Hell-fire’.” [Muslim]. So this is the reason behind the hadeeth, and in the version by Abi Hurayrah, he reported that: “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saw a man who did not wash his heel and he remarked: ‘Woe to the heels because of Hell-Fire’.” [Muslim].</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is obligatory to complete the wudhuu’ on each part of the parts of wudhuu’ thoroughly, leaving no dry spots.<br />
2. There is a warning and a threat as to the one who neglects this and improperly handles it.<br />
3. Since there is a threat, then negligence regarding this matter is a major sin.<br />
4. Washing the feet in wudhuu’ is obligatory if they are uncovered.<br />
5. Affirming the recompense on the actions. The recompense is related to the kind of action.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Questions for this Hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Why is it that ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibnu-l’Aas did not report many narrations?<br />
2. When did ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) die?<br />
3. What is intended in this hadeeth?<br />
4. True or False<br />
a. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) died when ‘Aa’ishah was a teen.<br />
b. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) particularized the heels because they are the places of accumulation of filth.<br />
c. Washing the feet in wudhuu’ is mandatory if they are uncovered.<br />
d. Negligence concerning any of the parts of wudhuu’ is from the minor sins.</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;" align="left">A Description of How the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) Made Wudoo&#8217;<br />
By Fahd ibn &#8216;Abdir Rahman ash-Shuwaib<br />
Translated by Dawood Burbank al-Britanee.</div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left"><strong>Contents:</strong></div>
<div align="left"></div>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC1"></a>Introduction</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC2"></a>Preface</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is for Allaah, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allaah from the evils of ourselves and our evil actions. Whomever Allaah guides there is none who can misguide him, and whomever Allaah misguides there is none who can guide him, and I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah Alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb (Creator, Master, Owner of All-Things), Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both, He created many men and women and, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights). and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you. </strong>[Sooratun-Nisaa&#8217;: Ayat 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O You who Believe! Fear Allah (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that he has forbidden) as He should be feared. [Obey Him, be thankful to Him. and remember Him always] And do not die except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allah.</b> [Sooratul-&#8216;Imraan ayah: Ayat 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O You who Believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you of your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (saws) he has indeed a great achievement (i.e. he will be saved from the Hell-Fire and made to enter Paradise). [Soorat</b><b>ul-Ahzaab: Ayat 70-71]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the Word of Allaah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), and the worst of affairs are the novelties and every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I desired to write this as a completion for the treatises which are in circulation amongst the people today &#8211; about the different fields &#8211; especially of worship such as Prayer and Fasting, etc. &#8211; which have made easier that which is difficult as regards religious rulings and being guided thereby, as it maybe difficult these days for some to read, research and extract these rulings from their places within the source books &#8211; either because of the ignorance of the Muslims or laziness or other worldly problems. I sincerely advise all the Muslims to read and research until they come to know and understand their true Deen &#8211; and I wished to write this in order to complete the series of the types of worship, especially since no one has particularized this topic in a treatise &#8211; except what occurs within the books of reference as we have explained &#8211; but I have not found this in the form of a treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My method for this treatise has been not to quote except what is authentic from the hadeeth of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<tt> - </tt>if Allaah wishes &#8211; ordering it according to the order of the Wudoo of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam),<tt> </tt>and I have commented on some of the points about which there is difference of opinion &#8211; stating that which is correct therefrom in our view after replying to the other opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to guide us to that which is proper &#8211; verily He is the One having authority over that and having the Power to do so.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC3"></a>The Definition of Wudoo</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Wudoo in the Arabic Language:</b></dt>
<dd>Wudoo is the action, and wadoo the water used therefor &#8211; and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Wudoo in the Sharee&#8217;ah:</b></dt>
<dd>Wudoo is using clean and cleansing (Tuhoor) water upon certain body parts as Allaah ta&#8217;ala has prescribed and explained.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC4"></a>The Prescription of Wudoo in The Kitaab And Sunnah:</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles</tt> [soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah, 5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>The Prayer of anyone of you breaching purification is not accepted unless he makes wudoo.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree, (Fath ul-Baaree, 1/206), Muslim (no.225) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa)<tt> </tt>said: Indeed I heard Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) say: <b>Allaah does not accept Prayer without purification, nor Sadaqah from illegally attained wealth.</b> [Muslim (1/160) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) said: Rasolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>Verily I have been ordered to make wudoo when I stand for Prayer</b>. [Saheeh. Reported by Abu Dawood (no.3760); at-Tirmidhee (no.1848), and he declared it to be &#8216;hasan-saheeh&#8217;: an-Nasaa.ee (1/73). And Shaikh al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;saheeh&#8217; (&#8216;Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, no.2333)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Abu Sa&#8217;eed (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu)<tt> </tt>said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>The key to Prayer is purification, its &#8216;tahreem&#8217;</b><a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn0">[1]</a><b> is the takbeer and its &#8216;tahleel&#8217;</b><a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn1">[2]</a><b> is the giving salaam.</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.60); at-Tirmidhee (no.3); Ibn Maajah (no.275) and others. Declared as &#8216;saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee: (&#8216;Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, no.5761)].</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC5"></a>The Excellence of Wudoo</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam) said: <b>Shall I not guide you to that by which Allaah wipes away the sins and raises the ranks?</b> They said: Certainly O Messenger of Allaah! He said <b>Completing the wudoo when it is a hardship, and many steps to the mosques and waiting for the [next] Prayer after the Prayer, that is &#8216;ar-Ribaat&#8217; (defending the frontiers), that is &#8216;ar-Ribaat&#8217; that is &#8216;ar-Ribaat&#8217;).</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/151) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) reports that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<tt> </tt>said <b>When the Muslim (or &#8216;Believing&#8217;) servant makes wudoo and washes his face then the sin of everything he looked at with his eye comes away with the water, or with the last drop of the water, and when he washes his hands then the sin of everything he stretched out his hands to comes away with the water, or with the last drop of the water. And when he washes his feet every sin which his feet walked towards comes away with the water or with the last drop of the water &#8211; so that he leaves clean (clear/pure) from sins.</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/148) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reports that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) came to the graveyard and said <b>Peace be upon you, dwelling of Believing People and we will (all) if Allaah wills join you soon. I would have liked to have seen our brothers!</b> They said: Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of Allaah? He said <b>You are my Companions and our brothers are those who have not yet come!</b> They said: How will you know those who have not yet come from your Ummah, O Messenger of Allaah? He said <b>Have you not seen that if a man had a horse with a white blaze and hoof along with a totally jet-black horse, then would he not know his horse?</b> They said: Certainly, O Messnger of Allaah. He said <b>So they will come with white blazes and marks from the wudoo and I am present before them at the Hand (&#8216;water-tank&#8217;) Indeed men will be driven away from my &#8216;water-tank&#8217; as the lost camel is driven away from their gathering place. &#8216;Come on&#8217;. So it will be said: &#8216;Indeed they have made changes after you,&#8217; so I will say: Be off, be off.</b> [Muslim 249].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Abu Umaamah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When a Muslim makes wudoo the sins he has committed come away from his hearing and from his sight and from his hand and from his feet, so when he sits he sits down having been forgiven.</b> [Reported by Ahmad (5/252) and is hasan].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Abu Maalik al-Ash&#8217;aree (radhiAllaahu anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) said <b>Purification is half of Imaan. And &#8216;al-hamdu lillaah&#8217; fills the Scales. And &#8216;subhaanAllaah&#8217; and &#8216;al-hamdu lillaah&#8217; fill whatever is between the heaven and the earth. And Prayer is a light. And Sadaqah is a clear proof. And Sabr (patience) is a shining light. And the Qur&#8217;aan is a proof for or against you. Every person starts the day dealing for his own soul so he either sets it free or destroys it.</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/140) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, his sins come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.</b> [Reported by Muslim (3/133) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo like this &#8211; then all of his previous sins are forgiven &#8211; and his Prayer and his walking to the mosque are above and beyond that.</b> [Reported by Muslim, 3/113].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam) said <b>When one of you makes wudoo and makes it well, then goes out to the mosque &#8211; having no purpose except Prayer &#8211; then his left foot continues to wipe away his evil deeds and his right foot continually writes for him good deeds until he enters the mosque. And if the people knew what there was in the night prayer and Subh prayers &#8211; then they would come to them even if they had to crawl.</b> [Reported by at-Tabraanee in &#8216;al-Mu&#8217;jam ul-Kabeer&#8217;. And Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee declares it to be saheeh (As-Saheehah, no.454). And its meaning is reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well then goes out &#8211; and then finds that the people have finished the Prayer &#8211; then Allaah gives him the same reward as one who had prayed it along with the people without diminishing any of their reward.</b>[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.564) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.856) and others. Al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;saheeh&#8217; (As-Saheehah, no.6039)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Zaid ibn Khaalid al Juhanee (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) relates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, then prays two rak&#8217;ahs not letting his mind wander in them &#8211; then Allaah forgives him all of his previous sins.</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.905) and others. Al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;hasan&#8217; (As-Saheehah, no.6041)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, then prays two rak&#8217;ahs concentrating therein with his heart and his face &#8211; then Paradise is obligatory for him.</b> [Reported by an-Nasaa&#8217;ee. Al-Albaanee declares it to be &#8216;saheeh&#8217; (As-Saheehah, no.6062)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: I heard Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) say <b>Whoever makes wudoo for Prayer and completes the wudoo &#8211; then walks to the obligatory Prayer and prays it with the people &#8211; or with the congregation &#8211; or in the mosque &#8211; then Allaah forgives his sins.</b> [Reported by Muslim (1/144) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. &#8216;Alee (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) relates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Completing the wudoo when it is a hardship, and walking to the mosque, and waiting for the next prayer after the previous one (greatly) washes away the sins.</b> [Reported by al-Haakim (1/132) who declared it to be saheeh to the standard of Muslim. And al-Haithumee said in &#8216;Az-Zawaa-id&#8217;: It is narrated by Abu Ya&#8217;laa and al-Bazzaar. And its narrators are up to the standard of Al-Bukharee],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. Humraan ibn Abaan relates that &#8216;Uthmaan asked for water to make wudoo &#8211; then he mentioned how the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo . Then he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said at the end of the hadeeth <b>Whoever makes wudoo in the same way that I have just made wudoo then stands up and prays two rak&#8217;ahs, not thinking of other things, then his previous sins are forgiven.</b> [Related by al-Bukhaaree (Fath ul-Baaree, 11/213) and Muslim (no.226) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee ( 1/63)] .</p>

<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC6"></a>The Components of Wudoo</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC7"></a>An Niyyah (Intention)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the firm resolve of the heart to perform wudoo in obedience to the order of Allaah ta&#8217;ala and His Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam). Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said (Majmoo&#8217;at-ur-Rasaa-il il-Kubraa 1/243): &#8220;The place of the niyyah is the heart and not the tongue in all forms of &#8216;ibaadah &#8211; and that is agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars &#8211; Purification, Prayer, Zakaat, Sawm, Hajj, &#8216;Itq (freeing of slaves), Jihaad, etc. If he were to express with his tongue other than that which he intended in his heart &#8211; then what he intended is counted, not what he said. If he voiced the intention with his tongue and the intention was not in his heart, that will not count &#8211; by total agreement of all the scholars of Islaam &#8211; so the niyyah is the firm intention and resolve itself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. As Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) himself explained in the hadeeth narrated by &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) in the Sahihain Verily the actions are by intention and there is for everyone only what he intended&#8230; [Fath-ul-Baaree, 1/9, and Muslim, 6/48].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC8"></a>At-Tasmiyyah (Mentioning Allaah&#8217;s Name)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217; anhu) said that Rasoolullah (sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) said <b>There is no wudoo for him who does not mention Allaah&#8217;s name upon it.</b>[Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.399), At-Tirmidhee (no.26), Abu Dawood (no.101) and others. Ash-Shaikh al-Albaani says: hadeeth Saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaarni&#8217;, no.7444)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad in one of his two sayings is of the opinion that it is obligatory in wudoo, ghusl, and Tayammum. He was followed in this opinion by Abu Bakr, and it is the saying of al-Hasan (al-Basaree) and Imam Ishaaq &#8211; as reported by Ibn Qudaamah in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217; (1/84) and their proof is this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah adds: If we take the saying that it is obligatory, then the wudoo of one who deliberately leaves it is not correct as he has left an obligatory duty in Purification &#8211; just as if he had left the intention; and if he left it forgetfully then his purification is correct. (Al-Mughnee). And this is the saying that we regard as being correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullah) he held it to be obligatory if the related hadeeth was authentic &#8211; as occurs in his Kitaab-ul-Imaan &#8211; and the hadeeth is authentic, so therefore his opinion (rahimahullah) is that it is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim report from Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) that some of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) sought water for wudoo , so Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Does any of you have water?</b> So he put his hand into the water and said <b>Make wudoo in the name of Allaah.</b> And I saw the water coming out from between his fingers until they all made wudoo . Thaabit said: &#8220;I said to Anas (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu): How many were there? He said: About seventy. [Al-Bukhaaree, 1/236, Muslim, 8/411, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, V8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof for that which we have stated &#8211; it is his (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saying <b>Make wudoo in the name of Allaah.</b> As for those who say that it is only sunnah mu&#8217;akkadah then they base that upon the relative hadeeth being da&#8217;eef ( There is no wudoo &#8230; ). However since the hadeeth is saheeh as we have explained, then there remains no proof for them and the proof is with us, and Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is therefore obligatory as we have shown, however the one who forgets should mention Allaah&#8217;s name when he remembers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC9"></a>Washing the Hands</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Humraan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that &#8216;Uthmaan called for water to make wudoo and washed his hands three times&#8230; then said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)make wudoo just as I have made wudoo . [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, and as preceded].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When one of you awakes from sleep then let him not enter his hand into the bowl/vessel until he washes it three times as he does not know where his hand has spent the night.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree (Fath ul-Baaree, 1/229), Muslim and it is his wording, as al-Bukhaaree doesn&#8217;t report &#8220;three times&#8221;].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. And in the hadeeth of&#8217;Abdullaah ibn Zaid (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) he was asked about the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), so he called for a bowl of water and made wudoo from it as the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo, and he poured out water from the bowl upon his hand and washed it three times. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, l/255), Muslim, 3/121].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Aus ibn Abi Aus reports from his grandfather (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) make wudoo washing his hands three times. [Ahmad (4/9), An-Nasaa&#8217;ee (1/55) &#8211; with saheeh isnaad].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC10"></a>Al-Madmadah and Al-Istinshaaq</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AL-MADMADAH: Is washing the mouth and moving the water around within it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AL-ISTINSHAAQ: Is taking water into the nose and breathing it into its backmost part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AL-ISTINTHAAR: Is expelling the water from the nose after istinshaaq.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC11"></a>Washing the Mouth and Nose Together with One Handful (of Water)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Zaid al-Ansaaree said that it was said to him: Perform for us the wudoo of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), so he called for a pot of water..until he said: So he washed his mouth and nose with a single handful and did that three times. [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC12"></a>Washing the Mouth</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. In the hadeeth of &#8216;Amr ibn Yahyaa (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) he said: And he washed his mouth and nose using three handfuls of water. [Muslim, 3/123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Imam an-Nawawi says: And in this hadeeth is a clear proof for the correct opinion that the sunnah in washing the mouth and nose is that it should be with three handfuls of water &#8211; washing the mouth and nose [together] with each of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. In the hadeeth of&#8217;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhaa) in which she describes the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said <b>When you make wudoo then wash your mouth.</b> [Al-Baihaqi says: &#8216;Its isnaad is saheeh.&#8217; And it contains an addition to the previous hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah in Abu Dawood, no.l43].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC13"></a>Washing the Nose and Expelling the Water</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When one of you makes wudoo then let him enter water into his nose, then expel it.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/229), Muslim (no.237), Abu Dawood (no. 140)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Exerting in sniffing in the water as long as you are not fasting is reported in the hadeeth of Laqeet (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: O Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), inform me of the wudoo . He said <b>Complete the wudoo and rub between the fingers and excert in breathing in the water into the nose unless you are fasting.</b> [Abu Dawood, no.l42; At-Tirmidhee, no.38; An-nasaa&#8217;ee, no.ll4; IbMaajah, no.407; and others]. (Declared as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haalcim, and adh-Dhahabee agreed to that. Also declared as saheeh by Ibn al Qaataan, An-Nawawi and Ibn Hajr. Refer to the footnote in al-Baghawi&#8217;s Sharh us-Sunnah: 1/417].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear from these two ahaadith that washing the mouth and nose are both obligatory (waajib). Ibn Qudaamah says in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;: Washing the nose and washing the mouth are both obligatory in both forms of purification &#8211; Ghusl and wudoo &#8211; as washing the face is obligatory in both of them in the established view of the madhhab; and it is the saying of Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ibn Abi Lailaa and Ishaaq, and it is reported from &#8216;Ataa.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC14"></a>Taking Water into the Nose with the Right Hand and Expelling it with the Left</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abd Khair said: We were sitting looking towards &#8216;Alee &#8211; as he made wudoo &#8211; and he entered into his mouth a handful of water with his right hand and washed his mouth and nose, then expelled it from his nose with his left hand &#8211; he did that three times, then said: Whoever would like to see the way of purification of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) &#8211; then this is his purification. [Reported by ad-Daarimee. Ash-shaikh al-Albaanee says in his notes on al-Mishkaat: Its isnaad is saheeh].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC15"></a>Washing the Face</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The face (wajh) is determined as being everything between the beginnings of the hair down to the cheeks and the chin, and up to the start of the ears including that which is between the beard and ear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.</tt><b> </b>[soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah,5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humraan ibn Abaan narrates that &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) called for water to make wudoo and so mentioned the way in which the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo . Humraan said: Then he washed his face three times. [Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/312), Muslim (no.226)].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC16"></a>Running Water Through the Beard with the Fingers</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to run his (wet fingers) through his beard. [At-Tirmidhee (no.31), Ibn Maajah (no.430), Ibn Jaarood (p.43) and al-Haakim (1/14~) who declared its isnaad as saheeh as did Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan. See the note in al-Baghagawi&#8217;s Sharh us-Sunnah, 1/421].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Anas (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam), when he made wudoo , used to take a handful of water and enter it below his chin and rub it through his beard and said <b>This is what my Lord &#8211; the Great and Exalted &#8211; has ordered me to do. </b>[Abo Dawood (no.145), al-Baihaqee (1/54), al-Haakim (1/149). Ash-Shaikh al-Albaani declares it to be saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, no.4572)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars have declared that entering water through the beard is obligatory and say: If he deliberately leaves it &#8211; then he must repeat the ( wudoo and) prayer. And this is the saying of Imam Ishaaq and Abu Thaur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the scholars however are of the opinion that the order is an order of desirability (istihbaab) and it is not obligatory &#8211; and that it is clearer that that which is obligatory is moving water through that part of the beard..so that it reaches the skin underneath. [Al-Khattaabee, 1/56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad and Laith and most of the scholars hold that moving water through the beard is obligatory when taking ghusl from Janaabah &#8211; and not obligatory in wudoo . [&#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood, 1/247].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC17"></a>Washing the Arms Including the Elbows</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: The arms here which we are ordered to wash begin with the fingertips and hands &#8211; which are to be included in this washing &#8211; they being part of the arm (yad) which we are ordered to Wash in the aayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.</tt><b> </b>[soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah,5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humraan ibn Abaan reports that &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) called for water for wudoo and mentioned the Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) way of making wudoo &#8211; and Humraan said: Then he washed his right arm including the elbow three times, then the left in the same way. [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim as has preceded].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding inclusion of the elbows in the washing of the arms &#8211; scholars have differed: Some of them saying that they must be included in this washing, and others saying that this is not so. And this difference of opinion is due to their disagreement over the meaning of the word &#8220;ilaa&#8221; (to) in the aayah &#8211; does it mean &#8216;up to/until&#8217; or &#8216;up to and including&#8217; ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who says that it means &#8216;up to&#8217; does not include the elbows in the washing &#8211; just as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>... thumma 'atimmus-siyaama ilaa -llail</tt>:<b> </b>Then complete your fast till the night appears; [soorat-ul-Baqara, 2:187]. And this is the opinion of some of the companions of Imam Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most scholars, however, hold the view that the meaning is &#8216;up to and including/along with&#8217; &#8211; and thus include the elbows in the washing and use as their evidence Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying: <b>.</b><tt>..wa yayazidkum quwwatan ilaa quwwatikum...:</tt><b> .</b>..and add strength to your strength; [Soorat-ul-Hud 11:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. The proof in this matter is the hadeeth of Nu&#8217;aim ibn Mijmar who said: I saw Abu Hurairah make wudoo &#8211; he washed his face and completed the wudoo , then washed his right hand until he reached the upper arm, then his left hand till he reached the upper arm&#8221; &#8211; then in the end of the hadeeth he said: &#8220;This is how I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) make wudoo . [Muslim, 1/246]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, dear reader, it is clear from this hadeeth that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to wash the elbows further, he used to increase upon that and wash part of the upper arm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Jaabir (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said that when the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallarn) made wudoo , he would pass the water over his elbows. [Reported by ad-Daaraqutnee (1/15), al-Baihaqee (1/56) and others &#8211; Ibn Hajr declared it to be hasan. And Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee declared it to be saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217;, 4547)].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC18"></a>Wiping the Head and Ears and &#8216;Imaamah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Wiping over all of the head as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>...wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum...</tt><b>:</b> &#8230;rub your heads (with water) [Soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah says in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;: Some of the people who claim that that which is ordered to be wiped is part of the head only &#8211; claim that the (Baa) [in the verse] means &#8220;part of&#8221; as if He had said: &#8220;Wipe part of your heads&#8221;.&#8217; However, we say that in His saying <tt>wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum</tt> the (Baa) is as if He said regarding Tayammum <tt>wamsahoo bi wujoohikum</tt><b> </b>[Allaah ta&#8217;ala orders us to wipe the faces].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore their saying that the (Baa) means &#8220;part of&#8221; is incorrect and unknown to the scholars of the language. Ibn Burhaan says: &#8216;He who claims that the &#8220;baa&#8221; means &#8220;part of&#8221; has declared before the scholars of the language that of which they have no knowledge. [al-Mughnee, 1/112].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaukaanee (rahimahullah) says in Nail-ul-Autaar: It is not established that it means &#8220;part of&#8221; and Seebawaih (one of the foremost scholars of the Arabic language) has denied that in fifteen places in his book. (Nail-ul-Autaar, 1/193).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. In the hadeeth of&#8217;Abdullaah ibn Zaid (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) is a further proof of the incorrectness of the saying that it means &#8220;a part of&#8221; &#8211; in that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) wiped his head with his two hands, moving them forwards and backwards &#8211; beginning with the front of the head and (wiping) with them up to his nape then he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) returned them to the place from which he began. [Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/251), Muslim (no.235), at-Tirmidhee (no.28) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Wiping the ears: The ruling for the ears is the same as that for the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. And it is authentically reported that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>The two ears are a part of the head.</b> [Reported by at-Tirmidhee, no.37; Abu Dawood, no.l34 and Ibn Maajah, no.444]. (Declared by ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee to be saheeh &#8211; as-Saheehah, 1/36 &#8211; and Imam Ahmad was of the view that wiping the ears has the same ruling as that for wiping the head.)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hold the view that it is a sunnah they do not have any evidence except their regarding this hadeeth as being da&#8217;eef &#8211; it is however authentic due to a chain of narration which they did not come across and so the proof is with our saying &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And of the scholars who hold that they are part of the head are Ibn al-Musayyib, &#8216;Ataa, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Sa&#8217;eed ibn Jubair and an-Nakha&#8217;ee and it is the saying of ath-Thauree and Ahl ur-Ra&#8217;y and Imams Malik and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC19"></a>Taking Fresh Water for the Head and Ears</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee says in &#8216;ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8217;, no.995: There is not to be found in the Sunnah anything which obligates taking fresh water for the ears &#8211; therefore he should wipe them along with the water for the head &#8211; just as it is also permissible to wipe the head with the water remaining from that of the arms after washing them according to the hadeeth of Ar-Rabee&#8217; bint Mu&#8217;awwidh that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) &#8220;wiped his head with water remaining in his hand&#8221;.

From &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr &#8211; about the way of performing wudoo &#8211; he said: Then he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b> </b>wiped his head and entered his two forefingers into his ears and wiped the backs of his ears with his thumbs. [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.135), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.140), Ibn Maajah (no.422) and authenticated by Ibn Khuzairnah].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC21"></a>Wiping Over the &#8216;Imaamah (Turban) Only</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. &#8216;Amr ibn Umayyah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b> </b>wipe over his turban and leather socks. [Reported by al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/266) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. Bilaal (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reports that the Prophet (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam) wiped over the leather socks and the head cover. [Reported by Muslim, 1/159].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC22"></a>Wiping Over the Turban and Forelock</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu&#8217;bah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) reports that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo and wiped over his forelock and over the turban and leather socks. [Reported by Muslim, 1/159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qudaamah says in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217; (1/310); And if part of the head is uncovered and it is normally so, then it is preferable to wipe over that along with the turban &#8211; that is recorded from Ahmad: as the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) wiped over his turban and forelock &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu&#8217;bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for caps/&#8217;prayer hats&#8217;, it is not permissible to wipe over them as Ahmad says for various reasons, from them: (1) They do not cover all of the head normally, nor are they tied around it. (2) There is no difficulty in their removal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the woman&#8217;s head cover &#8211; it is permissible to wipe over it as Umm Salamah used to wipe over her head cover &#8211; as reported by Ibn al-Mundhir. (See&#8217;al-Mughnee&#8217;, 1/312).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC23"></a>Washing the Feet and Ankles</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: <tt>...wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn...</tt>: &#8230;and (wash) your feet to the ankles [Soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:7] [thus ordering the washing of the feet and ankles].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) fell behind us and then came upon us during a journey, then we found him and it was time for &#8216;Asr &#8211; so we began to make wudoo and wipe over our feet, so he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) called out at the top of his voice Woe to the ankles from the Fire. (two or three times) [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/232) and Muslim, 3/128].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawi says in his explanation of Sahih Muslim after mentioning the hadeeth: Muslim&#8217;s intention (rahimahullah) in quoting these hadeeth was to prove with it the obligation of washing the feet &#8211; and that wiping them is not sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. In the hadeeth of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from Humraan ibn Abaan that &#8216;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) called for water for wudoo and then mentioned the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) &#8211; then Humraan said: Then he washed his right foot to the ankle three times and then his left foot to the ankle three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. As Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) did in Muslim&#8217;s narration: &#8220;Then he washed his right foot till he reached the shin, then he washed the left foot till he reached the shin&#8221; and in the end of the hadeeth said: This is what I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) do. [Muslim, 1/246].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this hadeeth &#8211; O Brother Muslim &#8211; it becomes clear that the ankles enter into this washing as is clear from his saying &#8217;till he reached the shin&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. Al-Mustaurad (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: When the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo he would enter the water between his toes with his little finger. [Reported by Abu Dawood (no.148), at-Tinnidhee (no.40) and Ibn Maajah (no.446). Declared as &#8216;saheeh&#8217; by al-Albaanee].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-San&#8217;aanee says in &#8216;Subul-us-Salaam&#8217; after quoting this hadeeth: It is a proof for the obligation of wiping between the toes &#8211; and this also occurs in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas which we have indicated &#8211; which is reported by at-Tirmidhee, Ahmad, Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim &#8211; and authenticated by al-Bukhaaree. And it is done by using the little finger. (See &#8216;Subul-us-Salaam&#8217;, 1/48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. And Laqeet ibn Sabarah said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam) said <b>Complete the wudoo and wipe between the Asaabi&#8217; </b>(fingers and/or toes). [Abu Dawood (no.142), at-Tirmidhee (no.37), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.114), Ibn Maajah (no.407), al-Hakim (1/148). Al-Albaanee says: Saheeh.]. As-San&#8217;aanee says: It clearly means both the fingers and toes and is shown clearly in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. [Subul-us-Salaam, 1/47].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC24"></a>The Reply to Those who Follow Wiping of the Feet Without Washing</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Wiping the feet when not wearing anything on the foot is not established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b>. </b>As for their using as a proof the reading of the Aayah:<tt>wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn</tt>: rub your heads and your feet to the ankles&#8230;[soorat-ul-Maaidah 5:7] reading (arjulikum) &#8211; and saying that the feet are thus connected to (the command to wipe) the heads &#8211; and this is not correct, rather they are connected to (the order to wash) the hands. As for the reading of the word (arjulikum) with Kasra of the laam &#8211; as-San&#8217;aanee says That is for wiping over the leather socks &#8211; as is shown by the Sunnah &#8211; and this is the best interpretation for this particular recital. (As-Subul, 1/58).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The Qur&#8217;aan is not to be explained according to the human intellect &#8211; especially in the matters of worship such as Salaat and wudoo , etc. &#8211; but by the Sunnah which explains this Pillar. And there are many such examples in the Qur&#8217;an which the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) explained by his sayings &#8211; and from this is the washing of the feet &#8211; and its proof from the Sunnah has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) If they wish to use the intellect then we say to them: The bottom of the foot has more right to be wiped than the surface (their saying being the wiping of the surface), and if they say: Then what about the socks? we say: That is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) just as washing the foot is also established in the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Leaving out one of two verbs and sufficing with one of them, as the Arabs, when two verbs come together having similar meaning and are followed by things related to them, makes it permissible to mention only one of the two verbs and attaching those things relating to the second to those relating to the first which is mentioned &#8211; according to what the wording demands, until it is as if the two are partners with regard to the verb, as the poet said: I fed it with hay and cold water. And what is meant is: I fed it with hay and gave it cold water to drink.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) The saying of az-Zajjaj (a great scholar of the language): It is permissible that the wording (arjulikum) has the meaning of &#8216;wash the feet&#8217; as the wording (ilal Ka&#8217;bain) conveys that meaning &#8211; as the mentioning of a limit suggests washing just as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says ilaal maraafiq [that is the limit of the elbows is for washing] however, if wiping were intended then there would be no need for mention of a limit just as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says wamsahoo bi ru&#8217;oosikum not mentioning any limit (for wiping the head) and further the term wiping can be used to mean washing. (Al-Mirqaat, 1/400).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) And further, the great majority of scholars have agreed that it is obligatory to wash the feet and that is reported &#8211; and reaches the level of mutawaatir from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says; and further it is not established that any of the Sahaabah differed regarding that &#8211; except what is reported from &#8216;Alee, Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhum) &#8211; and it is established that they went back on that. (Al-Mirqaat. 1/400~.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. And Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reports that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) came to the graveyard and said .<b>..they will come on the Day of Judgement with their blazes shining from the wudoo</b> (It has preceded, no.7). Meaning the Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) will know from the traces of the washing, as for those who do not wash then he will not know them on the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr says: And it is established that this shining of the faces, hands and feet are particular to the Muslim Ummah.</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC25"></a>Other Aspects of Wudoo</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC26"></a>The Siwaak</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The SIWAAK is that which the mouth is brushed with. And it is also called the MISWAAK, the plural being: SOOK. And the siwaak comes from the Araak tree and it is a well-known tree. Abu Hanifah said: It is the best of the trees whose twigs are used for brushing the teeth&#8230; smelling of milk. Abu Ziyaad said: From it is taken there tooth-sticks &#8211; from its twigs and roots &#8211; and the best part for that is its roots, and it is broadly spreading..And Ibn Shameel: The Araak is a tall fine-shoot green tree with many leaves and branches, having weak wood and growing in hollows &#8211; miswaaks are taken from it, being one of the citrus trees. Its singular is Araak and its plural Araa-ik. (Lisaan-ul-&#8216;Arab, 268).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mustahabb (desirable) to use the siwaak at many different times as is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he used to use the siwaak at every Prayer, and before reading the Qur&#8217;an, and before sleeping and when waking, and when the breath changes &#8211; whether fasting or not &#8211; or whether at the start of the day or in the afternoon, and it is a form of worship which is easy therefore observe it, O my Muslim Brother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. And also when making wudoo , as Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said I<b>f I did not fear to cause hardship to my Ummah I would have ordered them to use the siwaak with every wudoo.</b> [Reported by at-Tirrnidhee (no.22) who said: Hasan Saheeh, and Maalik (no.123), Ahmad (4/116), Abu Dawood (no.37) and others. Al-Albaanee declared it to be saheeh (Takhree; ul Mishkaat, no.390)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. And &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu&#8217; anhaa) narrates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>The siwaak is a means of cleansing the mouth and pleasing the Lord.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree reports it in mu&#8217;allaq form &#8211; connected by Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee, Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC27"></a>Ad-Dalk (Rubbing the Water over the Body Parts):</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is part of the wudoo authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam). Al-Mustawrid ibn Shadad said: I saw Rasoolullah (sailallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) when he made wudoo rubbing his toes with his litle finger. [Saheeh as has preceded].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Abdullah ibn Zaid (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihiwasallam) made wudoo and said <b>Rub in this way.</b> [See Nail-ul-Autaar, 4/39].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. He (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) also narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo with two thirds of a mudd<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn2">[3]</a> (of water) and rubbed over his forearms. [Ibn Khuzaimah (no.118), and its isnaad is Saheeh &#8211; and al-Haakim (1/161) reports it by way of Yahyaa ibn Abi Zaa&#8217;idah].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC28"></a>Performing the Wudoo in the Order Mentioned in the Ayaah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is narrated regarding the &#8216;order&#8217; as mentioned in the Aayah, then there is nothing to contradict that &#8211; and this order is obligatory (waajib) and it is said: Sunnah. [See Fiqh al Imam Sa&#8217;eed ibn al Musayyib, 1/64].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is related with regard to the Prophet&#8217;s wudoo (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) then it has been reported sometimes out of the regular order. And the proof is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. Al-Miqdaam ibn Ma&#8217;d Yakrib said: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) with water for wudoo , so he washed his hands three times, then washed his face three times, then washed his forearms three times, then washed his mouth and nose three times, then wiped his head and ears &#8211; their outsides and insides &#8211; and washed each of his feet three times. [Ahmad (4/132), Abu Dawood (1/19) with Saheeh isnaad. Ash-Shaukaanee (1/1~5) said: Its isnaad is good, and it is reported by ad-Diyaa in &#8216;al-Mukhtaarah&#8217;. And al-Albaanee records it in &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217;, no.261] .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a proof that he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) did not always stick to the regular order &#8211; and this is a proof that it is not obligatory &#8211; however, his sticking to it mostly shows that it is Sunnah. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyooti says as is reported from him in &#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood&#8217; ( 1/48): It is used as a proof &#8211; that is the aforementioned hadeeth &#8211; by him who says that sticking to the regular order in wudoo is not obligatory as he washed his mouth and nose after washing his arms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of &#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood&#8217; says: This narration is &#8216;shaadh&#8217;<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn3">[4]</a> &#8211; and therefore not to be taken in contradiction to the established narrations which put the washing of the mouth and nose before the washing of the face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The difference of opinion between the scholars here is with regard to those parts of wudoo which are Sunnah. As for the obligatory duties &#8211; then they are according to the order mentioned in the noble Aayah, and the best thing is to perform all of the actions in the way mentioned in the majority of the ahaadeeth &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC29"></a>Al-Mawaalaat (Washing Each Part Directly After the Previous one &#8211; Leaving no Time Gap in Between)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing other than this is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam). It is however established that Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu&#8217; anhu) urinated within the market, then made wudoo and so washed his face and hands and wiped his head, then he was called to pray over a Janazzah so he entered the mosque then wiped over his leather socks, then prayed over it. [Reported by Maalik (no.72) and al-Baihaqee (1/84). And &#8216;Ataa didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with leaving such gaps whilst making wudoo and it is the saying of al-Hasan, an-Nakha&#8217;ee and the better reported of the two sayings of ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC30"></a>Beginning with the Right</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is washing the right hand before the left &#8211; and likewise the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. &#8216;Aaishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;annaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to like to begin with the right in putting on shoes, combing his hair, in purification and in all of his affairs. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/235, Muslim (no.267) and others].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>When you dress and when you make wudoo , then begin with the right.</b> [Abu Dawood (4141), at-Tirmidhee (1766), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (402). Al-Albaanee declares it to be saheeh].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC31"></a>Economizing in the Use of Water and not Being Wasteful</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to make wudoo with a mudd (of water) and make ghusl with a saa&#8217; or up to five mudds. [Muslim (1/156) and others]. A saa&#8217; is equal to four mudds. ( A mudd is that amount of water which is held by the two hands cupped together.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you consider this hadeeth well, O my Muslim Brother, you would feel ashamed of what some people do these days &#8211; one of them opening the water tap and making wudoo and sometimes talking to his companion whilst the water is running out &#8211; what an excess in wastefulness! So he who does that should fear Allaah and remember this hadeeth and keep it in mind and follow the Sunnah with regard to using the water sparingly and not being wasteful &#8211; and here the true following of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) is made clear and the true Muslim&#8217;s belief. It is from the Sunnah for the Muslim who wishes to make wudoo to have with him a container large enough for a mudd of water &#8211; in order to force himself to return to the following of the Sunnah.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC32"></a>The Du&#8217;aa After the Wudoo</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alahi wa sallam)<b> </b>said <b>None of you makes wudoo and completes the wudoo then says:<br />
</b><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.qss.org/images/wudoo/1.gif" alt="" align="center" /><br />
<b>Ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu washhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abduhu wa rasooluhu </b>(I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave andMessenger) <b>except that all eight Gates of Paradise are opened for him &#8211; so that he enters by whichever he pleases.</b>[Reported by Muslim (no.234), Abu Dawood (no 169), at-Tirmidhee (no.55), an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.148), Ibn Maajah (no.470)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee adds an authentic addition to it:<b><br />
</b><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.qss.org/images/wudoo/2.gif" alt="" align="center" /><br />
<b>Allaahumma aj&#8217;alnee minat-tawwabeen waj&#8217;alnee minal mutatahhireen </b>(O Allaah, make me one of those who constantly repents toYou and of those who purify themselves.) [Declared as Sahih by al-Albaanee].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57. Abu Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)said <b>Whoever makes wudoo then says upon finishing the wudoo:<br />
</b><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.qss.org/images/wudoo/3.gif" alt="" align="center" /><br />
<b>Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illa anta astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika </b>(I declare You free from all defects my Lord and all praise belongs to you and I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I turn to You) <b>It is written in a parchment, then sealed and is not opened till Judgement Day.</b> [Reported by Ibn ar-Sunnee in &#8216;Amal al Yaurn wal-l~ilah, no.30. Declared as Saheeh by al-Albaanee].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC33"></a>Washing Each Body-Part Once</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo (washing each part) once. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/226].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC34"></a>Washing Each Body-Part Twice</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Zaid narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo (washing each part) twice. [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/226].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC35"></a>Washing Each Body-Part Twice</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60. In the hadeeth of&#8217;Uthmaan (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) recorded by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wasallam) washed each of the parts three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from these ahaadeeth it becomes clear to us that, as is well-known to the large majority of scholars, washing each body-part once is obligatory &#8211; and the second and third washings are Sunnah &#8211; and it is better to do likewise following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) [&#8216;al-Majmoo&#8217; of an-Nawawi, 1/229].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC36"></a>The Desirability of Making Wudoo for Each Prayer</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz says in &#8216;al Fath&#8217; (1/172) in the question &#8216;Making wudoo without having broken it&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61. Anas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) says: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to make wudoo for every prayer. I said: What had you (the Sahaabah) used to do? He said: One wudoo was sufficient for us till such time as we broke it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is an evidence that what is meant generally is the obligatory Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Tahaawee says: It may be that that was obligatory upon him (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) particularly &#8211; then was abrogated on the Day of Fath by the hadeeth of Buraidah &#8211; meaning that which Muslim reports &#8211; that he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) prayed all the Prayers on the Day of Fath with one wudoo and that &#8216;Umar (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) asked him about that so he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>I did it deliberately.</b> Or it may be that he (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to do it out of desirability only, then feared that it might be thought to be obligatory and so left it to show the permissibility of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The result is that making wudoo for every Prayer is mustahabb and praying all of the Prayers with one wudoo is permissible &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC37"></a>The One who is not Sure if he has Broken the Wudoo or not Relies upon that which he is Certain of</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he who knows that he has made wudoo then is not sure that he has broken it &#8211; then his wudoo remains. And he who knows that he has done that which breaks wudoo and doubts when he has made wudoo thereafter then he does not have wudoo . In each case he relies upon that which he is certain of before that which he has doubt about &#8211; and he throws the doubt away. And this is the saying of the great majority of scholars &#8211; and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee and Ahmad. [&#8216;Al-Mughnee&#8217;, 1/193, and ~iqh ul Awaaa&#8217;ee, 1/56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62. And the proof for this is what is established from Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) who said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>If one of you feels something in his stomach and he isn&#8217;t sure did anything (wind) come out of it or not &#8211; then let him not leave the mosque until he hears a sound or finds a smell.</b> [Muslim (Sharh an-Nawawi, 4/51), &#8216;Aaridat-ul-Ahwadhee Sharh ut-Tirmidhee, 1/79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeeth is a proof that things remain upon their original state until there is a certainty of a change in that, and doubt does not harm that &#8211; so he who is sure of having made wudoo and thinks that he may have broken it, then he remains upon wudoo .</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC38"></a>A Man and Woman&#8217;s Washing from a Single Vessel</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) narrates that one of the wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) took a ghusl from Janaabah then saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<b> </b>about to take a ghusl from the water remaining &#8211; so she informed him that she had made ghusl therefrom &#8211; so Rasoolulah said <b>Nothing makes the water impure.</b>[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.67), and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (no.326), and at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be hasan saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no.370)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abd ul-Barr says: There is nothing in the Sharee&#8217;ah to prevent each of them washing with the water remaining from the other &#8211; either together or one after the other, and this is the saying of the scholars of the different lands and the great majority of scholars &#8211; and the ahaadeeth about it are Mutawaatir. (Al-Istidhkaar, 1/373).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC39"></a>Making Wudoo after Eating Camel Meat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64. Jaabir ibn Samurah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrates that a man asked Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam): Should I make wudoo because of the meat of sheep? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>If you wish make wudoo and if you wish then do not make wudoo.</b> He said: Should I make wudoo from the meat of the camel? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Yes, make wudoo from the meat of the camel.</b> He asked: May I pray in sheep-pens? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Yes.</b> He asked: May I pray in the stalls of camels? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>No.</b> [Reported by Muslim, 1/189].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC40"></a>Drying the Body Parts after Purification</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uthman ibn &#8216;Affaan, al- Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, &#8216;Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak, &#8216;Abdullaah ibn al Haarith, Abu Ya&#8217;laa, Abul Ahwas, Ash-Sha&#8217;bee, Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn &#8216;Umar in a narration, and Abu Hanifah, Maalik, Ahmad, and the Shafi&#8217;ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that it is permissible after both wudoo and ghusl to dry the body-parts. And their evidence is what &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) reports &#8211; she said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) had a cloth which he used to dry himself with after making wudoo . [Reported by at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be da&#8217;eef]. Then al Ainee states that an-Nasaa&#8217;ee records it in &#8216;al-Kunaa&#8217; with saheeh isnaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it. (See Fiqh al-Imam Sa&#8217;eed, 1/70). Al-Albaanee declares the hadeeth to be hasan. (Saheeh ul Jaami&#8217;, 4706).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped his face with it. [Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.468)]. In az-Zawaa&#8217;id it is said: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In its isnaad is al-Wadeen ibn &#8216;Ataa who is sadooq but has a bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says in &#8216;Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb&#8217;, so its isnaad is da&#8217;eef!! &#8211; but it is strengthened by the previous hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah to the level of hasan &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after Purification and their proof is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhaa) who described the Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) ghusl from Janaabah and said: Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it. [Al-Bukhaaree, and Muslim &#8211; and the word is his].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Final word: Is that drying the body-parts is one of the desirable actions as shown by the hadeeth of Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) &#8211; as for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) &#8220;but he refused it&#8221; does not amount to the fact that it is makrooh &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC41"></a>Those Things which Break Wudoo</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC42"></a>(1) That Which Comes Out from the Two Private Parts (Front And Back):</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>Allaah does not accept the prayer of any one of you having committed hadath until he makes wudoo.</b> [Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/206) and Muslim (no.245)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67. An-Nawawi says in &#8216;al-Majmoo&#8217; (2/3) as for that which comes out of the two private parts &#8211; then it breaks wudoo according to Allaah ta&#8217;alas saying: <tt>Aw jaa'a ahadukum min al ghaa'it...</tt>: or one of you comes from offices of nature&#8230;[Soorat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:7] along with his (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saying <b>There is no wudoo except from a sound or a smell.</b> [Saheeh and has preceded (Saheeh ul Jaarni&#8217; (7443)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He adds: So that which comes out of the front or back part of a man or woman breaks the wudoo &#8211; whether excretion or urine or wind &#8211; or a worm or pus or blood or stones or anything else and there is no difference in that for something which happens normally or rarely.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC43"></a>(2) Sound Sleep<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/wudoo.html#fn4">[5]</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. &#8216;Alee ibn Abi Taalib (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>The eye is the drawstring for the anus, so he who sleeps then let him make wudoo.</b> [Abu Dawood (no.203), Ibn Maajah (no.477), Ahmad. Declared as Saheeh by al-Albaanee].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the hadeeth is an evidence that sleep does not in itself something that breaks wudoo , however the Purification is broken if it is possible for something to come out from the anus &#8211; however if that is restricted, e.g. by sitting flat on the earth, then that is not the case.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC44"></a>(3) Becoming Unconscious &#8211; Other than Sleep</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the &#8216;intellect&#8217; going away by any means because of insanirt or fainting or intoxication &#8211; as in this condition he does not know whether his wudoo is broken or not. This is the saying of the great majority of scholars. (Sharh Saheeh Muslim (4/74) and al-Mughnee (1/164)).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC45"></a>(4) Touching the Uncovered Private Parts</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>If one of you touches his penis and there is no veil between him and it nor any cover, then wudoo has become obligatory for him.</b> [al-Haakim (1/138) and others]. (Al-Albaanee says: hadeeth Saheeh.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC46"></a>(5) Touching the Penis</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70. Busrah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) <b></b>said <b>If one of you touches his penis then let him make wudoo.</b> [At-Tirmidhee (1/18) who said it is hasan saheeh. And also declared as Saheeh by Ahmad, al-Bukhaaree and Ibn Ma&#8217;een (Lum&#8217;aat ut-Tanqeeh Sharh Mishkaat ul Masaabeeh, no.319). Others also narrate it as authentic].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71. Talq ibn &#8216;Alee (radhiAllaahu&#8217;anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu&#8217;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about a man&#8217;s touching his penis. Should he make wudoo ? He (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said <b>And is it except a part of him? </b>[At-Tirmidhee (no.85) and he said: And this is the best of what is reported in this regard]. Al-Albaanee says: Its isnaad is Saheeh, and this (the view that it doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo) is established as being that of a group of the Sahaabah, from them: Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and because of these Imam Ahmad gave the choice between this and the one before it. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah harmonized the two carrying the first to mean if he touched it with desire and this upon the touching without desire &#8211; and there is in this hadeeth that which gives that impression and it is his (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saying &#8216;a part of him&#8217;. [Al-Mishkaat al Masaabeeh, notes on nos.3 19 and 320].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">(6) Touching a Woman with Desire:</h2>
<p><a name="_6"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72. A man&#8217;s touching a woman without desire does not break the wudoo . &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) says: <strong>Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) prayed and I was lying in front of him as in front of a Janaazah, so when he wished to prostrate I pulled up my leg.</strong> [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73. And in the same way a woman&#8217;s touching a man without desire does not break wudoo as is established from <strong>&#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhaa): I didn&#8217;t find the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) one night so I tried to find him with my hand &#8211; and my hand fell upon his feet which were raised up as he was making prostration</strong>. [Muslim (3/203) and an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (l/101)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we see from these two hadeeth that merely touching does not break the wudoo &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of&#8217;at-Ta&#8217;leeqaat us-Salafiyyah&#8217; upon Sunan of an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (1/23) says concerning &#8220;he pushed me with his foot&#8221;: It is well-known that that is a touching without desire. And so the author uses it as a proof that touching without desire does not break the wudoo . <strong>As for the touching with desire &#8211; its proof is that the wudoo is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> broken until a proof is established that it does indeed break it</strong> &#8211; and this is enough of a proof to show that it doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo for the one who holds that view &#8211; and above and beyond that is a further proof that it doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo is the hadeeth of kissing &#8211; as normally kissing is not free from touching with desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of &#8216;Aun al Ma&#8217;bood&#8217; (1/69) says regarding her saying &#8220;<strong>he kissed me and did not make wudoo</strong>&#8220;&#8216; &#8211; It contains a proof that touching a woman does not break the wudoo as kissing is part of touching and the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) did not make wudoo (before praying). And this (that <strong>touching a woman even with desire doesn&#8217;t break the wudoo</strong> ) is the saying of &#8216;Alee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and &#8216;Ataa ibn Taawoos, and Abu Hanifah and Sufyaan ath-Thawree. And this hadeeth is (in itself) da&#8217;eef but is supported by other narrations. And it is mursal &#8211; however ad-Daaraqutnee joins it &#8211; and it is (therefore) an authentic (saheeh) hadeeth inshaaAllaah. (See Nasb ur Raayah, l/70).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217; (1/190) says: The touching is not in itself something which breaks wudoo but breaks wudoo as it leads to prostratic fluid or semen being emitted &#8211; so the condition which leads to breaking of the wudoo is considered &#8211; and that is when there is desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Summary: <strong>That when a man and woman are safe from anything being emitted which breaks wudoo &#8211; then their wudoo is not broken;</strong> and it is preferable to be on the safe side, as they may not be safe from such emissions in the condition of desire &#8211; and Allaah Knows best.</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><a name="RTFToC47"></a>Conclusion:</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allaah ta&#8217;ala has made easy for us to gather together about the wudoo and its rulings, so we hope from Allaah the Most High, the All-Powerful, that we have been able to do justice to the subject &#8211; and we hope that any scholarly solicitous brother who comes across anything in our booklet which is incorrect to cover up and give sincere advice. And it is Allaah who grants success.</p>

</a>The prayer of a person who does hadath (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs (repeats) the ablution</p>

If anyone of you performs ablution he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers. And whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands three times before putting them in the water for ablution, because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep.</p>

Chapter 215<br />
The Excellence of using Miswak (Tooth-Stick)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1196.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Had I not thought it difficult for my Ummah, I would have commanded them to use the Miswak (tooth-stick) before every Salat</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1197.</b>  Hudaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) got up (from sleep), he would rub his teeth with Miswak (tooth-stick)</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1198.</b>  `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> We used to prepare for the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) a Miswak (tooth-stick) and the water for making Wudu&#8217;. Whenever Allah wished to awaken him from sleep at night, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would brush his teeth with Miswak, make Wudu&#8217;, and perform Salat</span>.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1199.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I stress upon you to use Miswak (tooth-stick)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1200.</b> Shuraih bin Hani (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I asked `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): &#8220;What was the first thing which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would do when he entered his house?</span>&#8221; She replied:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;He would use Miswak (tooth-stick)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1201.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) once and noticed the tip of Miswak (tooth-stick) on his tongue</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1202.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Miswak (tooth-stick) cleanses and purifies the mouth and pleases the Rubb</span>.&#8221;<br />
[An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Khuzaimah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1203.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There are five acts which conform to the pure nature: Circumcision, removing of the pubic hair, clipping the nails, plucking the underarm hair and trimming the moustache</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1204.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There are ten demands of pure nature: trimming the moustache, letting the beard grow, using Miswak (tooth-stick), snuffing up water into the nose (in ablution), paring the nails, washing the bases of the finger joints; plucking the underarm hair, removing of the pubic hair and removing impurities with water from the affected part after a call of nature</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subnarrator said: I forgot the tenth but it might possibly be the rinsing of the mouth (in ablution).<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1205.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Trim the moustaches and let the beard grow</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">His explanation of Shuroot as-Salaat of Imaam Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author (Imaam Muhmmad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab) stated: “The things that nullify (nawaaqid) the ablution are eight:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Whatever comes out from the two private parts;<br />
(2) Any foul impure substance that comes out from the body;<br />
(3) Loss of consciousness (i.e. sleep/insanity);<br />
(4) Touching a woman with sexual desire;<br />
(5) Touching one’s private part with the hand, whether it is the frontal or rear (private part);<br />
(6) Eating the meat of camels;<br />
(7) Bathing a deceased person; and<br />
(8) Apostating from Islaam, may Allaah protect us from that!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First:</strong> “Whatever comes out from the two private parts”: This refers to everything that comes out from the two private part areas, such as feces, urine, passing gas, blood, sperm, female ejaculation and so on. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Allaah does not accept the prayer of any of you if he releases (something) from his private parts, until he performs wudoo.”</strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (6954) and Muslim (537) from Abu Hurairah (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second: </strong>“Any foul impure substance that comes out from the body”: The scholars have differed concerning blood that is emitted from other that the two private parts – does it nullify the wudoo or not? Some of the scholars have taken the view that this does not cancel out the wudoo, since nothing has been authentically reported on the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) concerning that. Some other scholars have taken the view that it only cancels out the wudoo if a lot of this foul substance is emitted. This is the view that was reported on some of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, and this is the same opinion that the author has preferred here, may Allaah have mercy on him. This is taking the view that is most cautious and more removed from differing. See <em>al-Mughnee </em>(1/247), the <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa </em>of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him (10/159) and the Fataawaa of the Permanent Committee for Verdicts (5/261).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third:</strong> “Loss of consciousness (i.e. sleep/insanity)”: Wudoo is nullified by the loss of consciousness, whether due to insanity, drunkenness, fainting or deep sleep. As for the sleep in which one is drowsy and lightly dozes without him losing his sense of feeling, such as when one is sitting or standing and he dozes off, so his head bops back and forth, then he becomes conscious, this does not nullify the wudoo. Muslim reported in his Saheeh (376) from Anas (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that: “The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger would sleep then pray without performing (new) wudoo.” The wording of this hadeeth as reported by Abu Dawood (200) states: <strong>“The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) would wait for the ‘Ishaa prayer to the point that their heads would bop around. Then they would pray without performing (new) wudoo.”</strong> This proves that the loss of consciousness does not nullify wudoo in itself, but rather that it is just the most likely scenario where one’s wudoo will be broken. What also proves this is the statement of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>): <strong>“The drawstring of the anus is the eyes. So whoever falls asleep must perform (a new) wudoo.”</strong> [Reported by Abu Dawood (203) from ‘Alee (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) and its chain of narration is sound. See <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> (113). An-Nawawee, Al-Mundhiree and Ibn as-Salaah have also been quoted as declaring it <em>hasan</em> (sound).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth:</strong> “Touching a woman with sexual desire”: The opinion preferred here by the author is just one of the three opinions that exist on this issue. The second view holds that touching a woman nullifies one’s wudoo absolutely without exception. The third view states that touching a woman does not break one’s wudoo in the absolute sense, regardless of whether it is done with sexual desire or not, so long as nothing is emitted (i.e. ejaculation) with desire. This (last) opinion is the most correct of all the opinions because of the lack of there being any authentic texts that indicate that this nullifies the wudoo. See the <em>Fataawaa</em> (10/132-138) of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth:</strong> “Touching one’s private part with the hand, whether it is the frontal or rear (private part)”: This view that has been preferred here by the author is the view of the majority of the scholars, and it is the correct view. This is if the touch occurs without any barrier between the hand and the private part, regardless of whether one touches his own private part or the private part of someone else, or if the one being touched is young or old, dead or alive. This is based on the hadeeth narrated by Busrah bint Safwan (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who reported that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Whoever touches his penis must perform wudoo.”</strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee (82) and others and he said it was a “hasan saheeh hadeeth.” See <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel </em>(116) and the <em>Fataawaa</em> of the Permanent Committee for Verdicts (5/263-266)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth:</strong> “Eating the meat of camels”: There are two opinions from the scholars concerning the wudoo of one who eats the meat of camels. The first is the view of the majority of the scholars, which is that one is not required to perform wudoo from eating their meat. The second view states that one is obligated to perform wudoo because of that regardless of whether the meat is raw or cooked. As for the milk that comes from camels and the juice (gravy) of their meat as well as the food that is cooked along with its meat, then these things do not nullify one’s wudoo. What proves that one is required to perform wudoo because of eating the meat of camels is the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Samurah (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that a man once asked the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>): ‘Should I perform wudoo after eating the meat of sheep?’ He (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>‘If you wish, perform wudoo and if you wish do not perform wudoo.’</strong>The man then asked: ‘Should I perform wudoo after eating the meat of camels?’ He (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>‘Yes, perform wudoo from the meat of camels.’ </strong>The man asked: ‘Can I pray in the sheep stables?’ He (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>‘Yes.’ </strong>The man asked: ‘Can I pray in the camel resting areas?’ He (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>‘No.’ </strong>” [Reported by Muslim (360)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there is also the hadeeth of Al-Baraa bin ‘Aazib (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) in which he said: “The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was asked about performing wudoo after eating the meat of camels, so he replied: <strong>‘Perform wudoo from that.’ </strong>And he was asked about the meat of sheep, so he replied: <strong>‘Do not perform wudoo from that.’ </strong>Then he was asked about praying in the resting area of the camels, so he replied: <strong>‘Do not pray in the resting areas of the camels for indeed these places are from the devils.’</strong> Then he was asked about praying in the sheep stables, so he replied: <strong>‘Pray in them for indeed these areas are a blessing.’”</strong> [Reported by Abu Dawood (184) and others with an authentic chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fundamental principle with regard to a command (from the Prophet) is that that matter becomes an obligation. And the fundamental principle with regard to the mention of wudoo here is that it refers to the Islamic definition of wudoo. So this command is not to be interpreted as a recommendation nor is the wudoo here to be interpreted according to its linguistic meaning, which is washing the hands and rinsing. This is due to the lack of there being something that turns away this fundamental principle. See <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> (118). In his explanation of Saheeh Muslim, An-Nawawee mentioned the difference of opinion of the scholars concerning having to retake wudoo from the meat of camels, saying: “Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ishaaq bin Raahwaih reported two hadeeths concerning this – i.e. performing wudoo from the meat of camels – the hadeeth of Jaabir and the hadeeth of Al-Baraa. This is the view with the strongest proofs even if the majority of the scholars disagree with it.” Also refer to <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa</em> of Shaikh Ibn Baaz (10/156-158), may Allaah have mercy on him, and the Fataawaa of the Permanent Committee for Verdicts (5/273-277).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh:</strong> “Bathing a deceased person”: The scholars have differed into two opinions on the ruling of whether one is required to perform wudoo as a result of washing a dead person’s body. The first opinion is that it is obligatory to perform wudoo after washing the body of a deceased person, while the second states that it is just recommended. Ibn Qudaamah mentioned these two opinions in <em>al-Mughnee</em> (1/256) and inclined towards the view that it is recommended. Abu Dawood (3161) reported from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah in marfoo’ form: <strong>“Whoever washes a dead person, should perform ghusl. And whoever carries his body, should perform wudoo.”</strong> Al-Albaanee mentioned it in <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> (144) and in the book <em>Ahkaam-ul-Janaa’iz</em> (53), quoting Ibn Al-Qayyim, Ibn Al-Qattaan, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajr Al-‘Asqalaanee as declaring it authentic. He (i.e. Al-Albaanee) also mentioned that it most likely indicates its recommendation not its obligation, due to an authentic hadeeth in that regard from Ibn ‘Abbaas as well as a narration from Ibn ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If while washing the body, a person touches the private part of the person he is washing without there being a cover between him and the private part, he then becomes obligated to perform the wudoo for having touched the private part, not because he washed the deceased body. Also see the Fataawaa of Shaikh Ibn Baaz (10/165), may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth:</strong> “Apostating from Islaam, may Allaah protect us from that”: What the author, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentioned here from one losing his wudoo due to apostasy, is what Ibn Qudaamah attributed to the <em>madh-hab</em> of Imaam Ahmad in <em>al-Mughnee</em> (1/238). Furthermore, he attributed the view that apostasy doesn’t nullify the wudoo to the other three Imaams. So if a person performs wudoo and then apostates from Islaam, then returns back to it before committing one of the things that would break his wudoo, except apostasy, then he remains in his state of wudoo, according to the second opinion. So he is not required to repeat the wudoo. However, according to the first view, he is required to repeat the wudoo. But as for the opinion mentioned by the author, then it is the most cautious one and the farthest removed from differing, based on the statement of the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>): <strong>“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which doesn’t make you doubt.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it necessary for new converts to Islam to change their names? Should an adult convert be circumcised?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible for new Muslims to change their names if they carry wrong or bad meanings, as this is a sign of conversion to Islam. If one asks the reason for a convert having changed their name, in most cases, their names before converting to Islam were not suitable, thus they felt it necessary to change them to Islamic names such as Saleh, Ahmad, `Abdullah, `Abdul-Rahman, Muhammad, etc. Names which suggest slavery to other than Allah such as `Abdul- Messiah, `Abdul-Zahra, or `Abd-Musa must be changed to `Abdullah, `Abdul-Rahman and the like, as servitude is to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Alone. Therefore, it is best to change names which express servitude to other than Allah and which are familiar and used by the Kuffar (disbelievers) to Islamic names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better for new Muslims to get circumcised by highly-skilled, experienced doctors, even when accepting Islam as adults. A group of scholars hold that it is Wajib (obligatory) upon new converts be circumcised unless there is fear of harm. If a doctor feels that circumcision may harm them, it is waived in this case. However, if a doctor know that it will not cause them any harm, they should be circumcised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Circumcision is a stressed Sunnah and Wajib according to a group of scholars. Therefore, if it is feasible for an adult to be circumcised without suffering any harm, it is better and safer to undergo such procedure, otherwise they do not have to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If getting circumcised will drive a person away from Islam, it should not be mentioned to them. It can also be abandoned, for embracing Islam is a great bounty even without being circumcised. Therefore, a new convert need not be informed of this if it will turn them away from Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a new convert becomes steadfast in Islam, they should be circumcised, if it would not pose any risk to their health; otherwise they should not undergo this procedure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: On our visit to Uganda, we noticed that some Christians bring their children to embrace Islam in an orphanage for newly converted Muslims. When the parents were asked why they themselves do not embrace Islam, their answer was that they fear being circumcised. What is the opinion of Your Eminence concerning this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not necessary to demand that they be circumcised, if they fear that, for this is Sunnah (action following the teachings of the Prophet) and not an obligatory action, according to the majority of scholars. Those who maintain that circumcision is obligatory restrict it to situations where there are no fears for the circumcised person&#8217;s safety</span>.</p>
<p>If this fear of circumcision prevents those Christians from embracing Islam, they should not be asked to do it at the time of embracing Islam. When Islam becomes firm in their hearts, this matter can be reconsidered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>
