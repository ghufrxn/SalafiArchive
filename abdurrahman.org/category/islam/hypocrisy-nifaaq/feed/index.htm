<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book (what means): <em>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</em>. What is meant by hypocrisy and hypocrites in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse)? Please clarify their meaning.</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites are those who make a false pretense of Islam, when they are professing otherwise. They claim to be Muslims, although deep down they disbelieve in Allah and belie the Messenger (peace be upon him). These are the hypocrites who are so called because they show Islam, while hiding Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And of mankind, there are some </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">who say: &#8220;We believe in Allâh and the Last Day&#8221; while in fact they believe not. They </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(think to)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceive Allâh and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> not! In their hearts is a disease </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(of doubt and hypocrisy) </span><span style="color:#008000;">(namely doubt and suspicion) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and Allâh has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This theme is continued in the Ayahs following them in Surah Al­Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites who disbelieve in Allah and belie His Messengers (peace be upon them). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As­Salât </strong>(the prayer)<strong>, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allâh but little. </strong>(They are) <strong>swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those.</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they vacillate between the Kafirs (disbelievers) and the Muslims; at times they support the Kafirs when they prevail and achieve victory and at other times they support the believers when they prevail and achieve victory. They are not steadfast; their Din (religion) is not constant, and their Iman (Faith) is not solid. They waver between the state of Kufr and the state of Iman, and between the Kafirs and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) has disclosed their Kufr in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and that they came not to As­Salât </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the prayer) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly. So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;">sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; in reality Allâh’s Plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(die) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">while they are disbelievers.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 59: Point 102 </strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know that there has never been any heresy except from the ignorant rabble who follow anyone who calls out wildly. They bend with every wind that blows, so anyone who is like that has no religion. Allah, the Blessed and Most High, says:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَمَا اخْتَلَفُوا إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They did not differ until after the knowledge came to them, through envy amongst themselves.</strong></span>[Soorah al-Jaathiyah (45): 17]</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَا اخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ فَهَدَى اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لِمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 30 : Point 38</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And hypocrisy (an-nifaaq) is to display Islaam upon the tongue whilst hiding disbelief (al-kufr) in the heart.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F371203025&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/hypocrisy-in-belief-nifaaq-itiqaadee-and-hypocrisy-in-action-nifaaq-amaliy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-nifaaq</em> (hypocrisy) is to show outwardly that which is good and to conceal inwardly that which is evil. And it (<em>nifaaq</em>; hypocrisy) is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first of them being:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Nifaaqun I`tiqaadiyy</em> (hypocrisy of belief)</span> and this is <em>kufrun akbar</em> (major disbelief). And the hypocrite; munaafiq is worse than the <em>kaafirun asliyy</em> (original disbeliever) because the original disbeliever, it is well known about him that he is a disbeliever; kaafir and that he is an enemy. However, the munaafiq (the hypocrite), he deceives the Muslims and he manifests that he is from them when he is actually an enemy to them. He manifests openly that he is a Muslim whilst when he is actually a kaafir (a disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They try to deceive Allaah and those who believe but they do not actually deceive except their ownselves whilst they do not perceive.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, Allaah will put them in the lowest depths of the Fire beneath the worshippers of the idols and the kuffaar (disbelievers) because they are worse than the disbelievers. And therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High said with regard to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They </strong>(the hypocrites)<strong>, they are the enemy so beware of them, may Allaah curse them, how do they deviate away from the truth?</strong></span> [01] (Sooratul-Munaafiqoon (63), aayah 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-Nifaaqun I`tiqaadiyy</em> (hypocrisy of belief) is that which <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) can never combine with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>An-Nifaaqun `Amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in actions)</span>; it is that a person is a believer; a mu`min outwardly and inwardly. However, some characteristics come from him from the characteristics of the hypocrites, which render his <em>eemaan</em> deficient and there is a severe threat for it. However, he does not exit from the religion. It is called <em>an-nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in action) and it is called an-<em>nifaaq ul-asghar</em> (the lesser hypocrisy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this is occurs in his saying <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“There are four things, whoever has them all in him then he will be a pure hypocrite and whoever has a single characteristic from them then he will have a characteristic of hypocrisy till he abandons it. When he talks, he lies and when he makes a promise, he breaks it and when he is trusted, he proves treacherous and when he argues, he speaks in a foul manner.”</span> </strong>[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with regard to the believer, then hypocrisy in action may appear from him and it will be a deficiency in his eemaan and he will be deserving of the threat, however, he does not depart from the religion on account of that. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this hypocrisy in action is <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>ar-riya</em></strong></span> (performing deeds to show off), which Allaah’s <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> feared for his companions and he called it lesser shirk. So he said: </strong><strong>“That which I fear most for you is lesser shirk.” </strong><strong>So they said: </strong><strong>“And what is lesser shirk, Oh Messenger of Allaah?” </strong><strong>So he said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“It is ar-riya (acting to show off). Allaah will say on the Day of Resurrection when the people are recompensed for their deeds; go to those people whom you used to show off to in the world and look and see, do you find any recompense with them and any reward with them?” </strong></span>[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Shall I not inform you of that which is more fearful with me upon you than AlMaseehud-Dajjaal?” So they said: “Yes indeed.” So he said: “It is hidden shirk that a man stands up and prays and he beautifies his prayer because of the fact that he sees a man looking at him.”</strong> </span>[05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when this person prays in the presence of the people, he adorns his prayer and when he prays in his house or in a place when he is unseen, he prays very quickly. Then this is what the Companions used to fear for themselves severely. So, no-one can declare himself to be totally free and innocent of it. So a person should fear it and therefore they said with regard to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No-one fears it except for a true believer and no-one feels secure from it except for a hypocrite.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim fears for himself from this hypocrisy, which is lesser hypocrisy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And hypocrisy is that he manifests Islaam upon his tongue and he hides disbelief in the heart”</strong>, this is the definition of <em>an-nifaaqun i`tiqaadiyy</em> (hypocrisy in belief) and it is <em>an-nifaaqun akbar</em> (major hypocrisy) and <em>eemaan</em> cannot combine with this. So it will never occur from a <em>mu`min</em> (a believer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High at the start of Sooratul-Baqarah divided mankind into three categories :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) believers; <em>mu’mineen</em> outwardly and inwardly ,<br />
(2) disbelievers; <em>kuffaar</em> outwardly and inwardly and<br />
(3) the hypocrites; <em>munaafiqeen</em>; those who manifest Islaam outwardly but hide disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He, the Perfect said in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif-Laam-Meem. This is the Book about which there is no doubt, it is a guidance for the people of <em>Taqwaa</em> (dutiful to Allaah), those who truly believe in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen) and who establish the prayer and who spend from that which we have given them and those who truly believe in that which was sent down to you (Muhammad) and who believe in that which came down before you and those who truly believe in the Hereafter. They are upon guidance from their Lord and they are the ones who will prosper.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 1-5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aayahs are with regard to the believers; mu’mineen, those who are believers outwardly and inwardly. As for the disbelievers; outwardly and inwardly and Allaah said with regard to them in the following aayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who disbelieve, it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. Allaah has put a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and upon their sight there is a covering and there will be a tremendous punishment for them.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 6-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said with regard to the 3rd category; the hypocrites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from the people, there are those who say we believe in Allaah and in the Last Day but they are not believers. They attempt to deceive Allaah and those who believe but they do not actually deceive except themselves whilst they do not perceive&#8230;.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Deaf , dumb and blind so they will not return to the truth.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 8-18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these aayahs are with regard to the hypocrites; the munaafiqeen and they are ten and odd aayahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The hypocrite is the one who manifests Islaam upon his tongue and hides disbelief in the dameer; heart.”</strong> Ad-dameer means that which he conceals within the heart. [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01 <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em>hafizahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Indeed there has come down with regard to them (the hypocrites) a soorah which is specifically about them, which is called Sooratul-Munaafiqoon; 63rd soorah and it from its start to its end speaks about their shameful deeds just as Allaah, the Most High also exposed them in other soorahs as occurs in Sooratul-Noor, 24th soorah, and Sooratut-Towbah the 9th soorah to the extent that this soorah is called Al-Faadeehah (the exposing soorah) because it exposes the hypocrites and also Sooratul-Ahzaab; 33rd soorah and some parts of Sooratul-Baqarah and some parts of Soorah-Aali `Imraan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (34) and Muslim (58) from a hadeeth of Abdullaah ibn Amr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Shaykh Saalih As Suhaymee</strong> hafizahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And this type of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy with regard to actions) does not take the person outside the fold of Islaam even though the seriousness of its sin is great because it may lead over time to falling into hypocrisy in belief and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>Aameen</em>. And all of it is evil and hypocrisy is blameworthy from every angle and therefore there has never been any movement against Islaam and against the Muslims except that the hypocrites were found within their ranks; either aiding them with material or by laying down plans for them, plotting for them or by preparing the way for them or by making false promises until Allaah, the Exalted and Most High exposed them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, al-Bayhaqiyy in Shu`b al-Eemaan, al-Bagawiyy in SharhusSunnah from a hadeeth of Mahmood ibn Labeeb radiyAllaahu `anh and al-Mundhiriyy said in his book AtTargeeb Wa At-Tarheeb, “its chain of narration is good.” Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said in his checking of AtTargeeb Wa At-Tarheeb, “saheeh (authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, ibn Maajah in his Sunan, at-Tahaawiyy in Sharh Mushkili alAathaar, ibn Adiyy and a number of others, at-Tabariyy in Tahdheebu al-Aathaar, al-Haakim and others from a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy radiyAllaahu `anh. This hadeeth was declared saheeh by atTahaawiyy and al-Haakim and ad-Dhaahabi agreed and al-Boosayriyy declared it hasan in his Misbaah AzZujaajah; al-Boosayriyy`s notes on his checking of ibn Maajah. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said in his checking of ibn Maajah, “this hadeeth is hasan (good).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“<em>An-nifaaq</em> (hypocrisy) is derived from <em>an-nafq</em>, which means <em>al-juhr</em>; literally animal burrow or a tunnel, which is found in the earth and it is called that because the person who has it has hypocrisy. He makes apparent something contrary to that which he hides. And this is what is called <em>an-nifaaqun i`tiqaadiyy</em>; (hypocrisy in belief) and as for <em>nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in action) then that does not take a person outside Islaam, rather this person remains as a Muslim and this is called <em>nifaaqun `amaliyy</em> (hypocrisy in action) because the person with it, he manifests something contrary to what he hides does something. </span><span style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">As for </span><em style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">an-nifaaqun i`tiqaadiyy</em><span style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;"> (hypocrisy in belief) then that is the hypocrisy of the hypocrites, those who were in the time of the Prophet </span><em style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;">sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em><span style="color:#993300;font-size:1rem;"> and it is to manifest Islaam whilst hiding disbelief and the person tries to guard against revealing what he actually believes and therefore Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic has informed about them that the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth of the Fire and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 259<br />
Condemnation of Double-faced People</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>They may hide (their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (them) from Allah; for He is with them (by His Knowledge), when they plot by night in words that He does not approve. And Allah ever encompasses what they do.</b></span><b>&#8221; (4:108)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1540.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People are like ores. Those who were excellent in the Days of Ignorance are excellent in Islam provided they acquire the knowledge and understanding of the religion. You will find the best people in it (Islam) those who had a deep hatred (for leadership). You will find the worst among the people a double-faced person who appears to some people with one face and to others with another face</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1541.</b> Muhammad bin Zaid reported: Some people said to my grandfather, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar (May Allah be pleased with them)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">:</span> <span style="color:#008000;">We visit our rulers and tell them things contrary to what we say when we leave them. `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) replied: &#8220;In the days of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we counted this act as an act of hypocrisy</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="038.6677"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which we faced many hardships. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone to &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:&#8221; When the hypocrites come&#8221; (lxiii. 1). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar reported that when &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul died. His son &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abdullah (b. Ubayy) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and begged him that he should give him his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had hardly got up to observe the prayer for him that &#8216;Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:&#8221; You may beg pardon for them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times&#8221; (ix. 80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering prayer over them)&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud reported that there gathered near the House three persons amongst whom two were Quraishi and one was a Thaqafi or two were Thaqafis and one was a Quraishi. They lacked understanding but wore more flesh. One of them said: Do you think that Allah hears as we speak? The other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in undertones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; You did not conceal yourselves lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you&#8221; (xli. 22).</p>

The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) were divided in two groups. One group said: We would kill them, and the other one said: No, this should not be done, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to hypocrites?&#8221; (iv. 88).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri reported that during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the hypocrites behaved in this way that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) set out for a battle, they kept themselves behind, and they became happy that they had managed to sit in the house contrary to (the act of) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace he upon him) came back, they put forward excuses and took oath and wished that people should laud them for the deeds which they had not done. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful chastisement&#8221; (iii. 18).</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with the people of the Book.&#8221; Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; When Allah took a covenant from those who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this&#8221; (iii. 186), and then Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done&#8221; (iii. 186). Ibn &#8216;Abbas (further) said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him something else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them and they felt happy of what they had concealed.</p>

Is it your personal opinion or something you got from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? &#8216;Ammar said: We have got nothing from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which people at large did not get, but Hudhaifa told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had especially told him amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hypocrites out of whom eight would not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through the needle hole. The ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do not remember what Shu&#8217;ba said about them.</p>

He said: It was not because of any covenant that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got from us which he did get from other people, and he further said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; In my Ummah.&#8221; And I think that Hudhaifa reported to me and according to Ghundar (the words are) that he said: In my Ummah, there would be twelve hypocrites and they would not be admitted to Paradise and they would not smell its odour, until the camel would pass through a needle&#8217;s hole. Dubaila (ulcer) would be enough to (torment them) -a kind of flame of Fire which would appear in their shoulders and it would protrude from their chest.</p>

He said: I adjure you by Allah to tell me as to how many people from Aqaba were. The people said to him (Hudhaifa) to inform him as he had asked. We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (may peace be upon him) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the announcement of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we were not aware of the intention of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day.</p>

Then there was a ceaseless flow of persons and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to them: All of you are those who have been pardoned except the owner of a red camel. We came to him and said to him: You also come on, so that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) may seek forgiveness for you.

He ran away as a rebel and joined the People of the Book. They gave it much importance and said: He is the person who used to transcribe for Muhammad and they were much pleased with him. Time rolled on that Allah caused his death. They dug the grave and buried him therein, but they found to their surprise that the earth had thrown him out over the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">It is reported that ‘Abdullâh b. Mas’ûd – Allâh be pleased with him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of the believer, the unbeliever and the hypocrite is that of three people who arrived at a valley. One of them descended and passed through to the other side. One of them descended until he reached half way, when the third man on the edge of the valley called to him, “Woe to you, where are you going? You will die. Come back.” The man who made it to the other side called to him, “Come and be saved.” So [the man in the middle of the valley] kept looking back and forth at the two [on each side of the valley], when a flood came into the valley and drowned him. The man who passed through to the other side is the believer; the one who drowned is the munâfiq (hypocrite) – <em><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who remained at the edge of the valley [not  able to escape the flood and pass] is the kâfir (unbeliever).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The likeness [of the munâfiq] is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allâh took away their light and left them in darkness. So they could not see. They are deaf, dumb and blind, so they return not [to the Right Path].</span> (Quran 2:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatâdah – Allâh’s mercy be upon him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the likeness Allâh has given of the Hypocrite (munâfiq); he says lâ ilâha illallâh and with it marries into the Muslims, inherits from the Muslims, fights alongside the Muslims, and protects his blood and wealth. But when death comes, [the testimony of faith] has no basis in his heart, and no reality in his actions, so the munâfiq is stripped of it at death and left in darkness and blindness wondering therein, just as he was blind about the right of Allâh and obedience to Him in his worldly life and deaf to the truth.</p>
