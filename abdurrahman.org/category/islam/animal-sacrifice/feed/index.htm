<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Slaughtering animals upon building houses</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: In our residential area, people are accustomed to slaughtering an animal upon starting or finishing the construction of a house. Neighbors and relatives are invited on this occasion. What is Your Eminence&#8217;s opinion about this practice? Is there any recommendable act to be performed before going to live in a new house? Benefit us may Allah reward you well!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 2; Page No. 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice needs to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If by slaughtering the animal the owners of the house seek to protect themselves from jinn or ensure that the house is safe to live in or any similar issue, this practice will be considered an act of <strong>Bid&#8217;ah</strong> (innovation in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the slaughter is offered for the sake of the jinn, then it will be considered an act of <strong>major Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as it involves offering an act of Ibadah (worship) to someone other than Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if by doing this, one intends <strong>to show gratitude to Allah&#8217;s Blessings</strong> for reaching the roof or completion of construction works there is nothing wrong with this and with inviting the relatives and neighbors. This is the custom of many people who offer thanks to Allah due to Him helping them construct a house of their own instead of renting a house to live in. There is nothing wrong in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the <strong>intention</strong> behind this is to protect oneself from jinn or to fulfill any other non-Islamic purpose, then this practice is impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice will be valid only if the intention is to show gratitude to Allah for enabling one to construct a house of their own. This practice is similar to being hospitable to one&#8217;s relatives and neighbors.This is also similar to holding a <strong>marriage banquet</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A similar practice is performed when people <strong>return from travel</strong> when animals are sacrificed and relatives are entertained. It was the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wasallam</em>) regular practice that upon returning from a journey he would slaughter a camel and invite people to dine with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/defects-in-the-sacrificial-animal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The following is posted from: <a title="The Conditions of a Sacrificial Offering – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2009/11/19/the-conditions-of-a-sacrificial-offering/">The Conditions of a Sacrificial Offering</a> – Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Condition:</strong> The animal must be free of any defect that would prevent its slaughter from being valid and acceptable. These defects are of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear defectiveness of the eye</span>: This is when the animal’s eye becomes sunken or it sticks out to the point that it looks like a knob or it becomes a pale white indicating clearly that it is one-eyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear illness</span>: This is when the animal exhibits signs of sickness, such as a fever that keeps it from grazing and causes a loss of appetite, or an obvious scabies infection that will spoil its meat and harm a person’s health (if he eats it), or a deep wound that threatens to affect its health and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear limping</span>: This is when the animal is unable to step safely (without hurting itself) when walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span style="color:#993300;">Emaciation that causes brain loss</span>: This is based on what the Prophet said when he was asked about what types of animals one should avoid when sacrificing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gestured with his hand and said: <strong>“They are four: The lame animal that clearly walks crookedly; the one-eyed animal that clearly has a defect in the eye; the sick animal that clearly has signs of illness; and the emaciated animal that is (usually) not picked.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth was reported by Maalik in al-Muwatta from Al-Baraa’ bin ‘Aazib. In another version of this report narrated by Al-Baraa’ found in the <em>Sunan</em> collections, he said: “The Messenger of Allaah stood up amongst us and said: <strong>‘Four types (of animals) are not permissible to use as sacrificial offerings…’</strong> and he went on to mention them.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore if these four defects are found in an animal, they prevent its slaughter and sacrifice from being valid. This goes as well for any other defect that is similar to or worse than these, which means that it is also not valid to sacrifice the following types of animals:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A blind animal that cannot see with both its eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. An animal suffering from nausea until it releases its load and its harm is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. An animal that has been assisted in giving birth if natural delivery is difficult until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. An animal afflicted by something fatal such as choking, falling from a high place, and so on until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. A crippled animal, which is an animal that cannot walk due to a physical disability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An animal with one of its front legs or back legs broken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these last defects are added to the four mentioned in the narrations, the types of animals that cannot be slaughtered become ten in total. There are these six types plus the animals that suffer from the four previously mentioned defects.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em></strong><strong> (Sacrificing or Slaughtering), its Types and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for sacrificing is His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: My prayer and my sacrificing and my living and my dying are all for Allaah alone, the Lord of the whole of creation </strong></span>[6:162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the sunnah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ ذَبَحَ لِغَيْرِ الله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has cursed the one who sacrifices for other than Allaah.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>25</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">25</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>adh-Dhab<u>h</u></em> (sacrificing or slaughtering) is of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Firstly</span>:</strong> sacrificing which is done to seek closeness and to honour and venerate someone, and this is not permissible except for Allaah the Perfect and Most High, because it is an act of worship involving wealth. So therefore it is not permissible to sacrifice for the <em>jinn</em> nor for the devils nor for the kings nor for the leaders in order to show honour and veneration of them, because this is worship – it is not permissible except for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those people who sacrifice for the jinn in order to gain safety from their evil, or in order for a sick person to be cured, as is done by the soothsayers and by the astrologers, those who claim to be able to heal or cure, and who say to the people, “if you sacrifice such and such in order to cure your sick person and do not mention the Name of Allaah upon it” – this is major shirk which takes a person outside of the religion and this is what Allaah the Most High has said in warning against doing it for other than Allaah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: My prayer and my sacrificing and my living and my dying are all for Allaah alone, the Lord of the whole of creation </strong></span>[6:162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So pray for your Lord and sacrifice to Him</span> </strong>[108:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: make sacrifice for your Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second type of sacrifice is: </strong></span>slaughtering an animal in order to obtain meat to eat. This, there is no harm in it, because it is not something slaughtered to draw closer to anyone or to venerate anyone, it is just being sacrificed for a need, and eating is from that; so this, there is no harm in it, because it is not a type of worship, and it can be slaughtered in order to sell the meat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The third type of sacrifice is: </strong></span>sacrificing which is done at times of joy and happiness, on the occasion of a marriage or on the occasion of settling in a new home or someone returning after an absence, or the like of that, by gathering one’s relatives and then performing a sacrifice in order to show one’s happiness and joy at what has occurred. This, there is no harm in it, because it does not contain veneration of anyone, and it is not seeking to draw closer to anyone, rather it is just a case of joy and happiness at something that has occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Fourthly</span>:</strong> sacrificing in order to give meat away in charity for the poor people and the needy and the destitute, this is counted as being a sunnah, and it enters into worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Before you is a translation of the book: &#8220;<em><strong>Talkhees Ahkaam-ul-Udhiyah wadh-Dhakaat</strong> </em> [<strong>The Rules of Sacrificial Offerings and Slaughtering &#8211; Abridged</strong>] which is a condensed version of a larger book written by Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen [D. 1421H].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction, he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I had previously written a rather lengthy book on the rules of sacrificial offerings and slaughtering, which was published in 93 pages and contained discussions on some issues of difference. However, foreseeing that the book might be too long for the average reader, I felt that I should abridge that book and leave out unnecessary discussions while adding to it what needed to be added.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author has divided his discussion into ten solid and informative chapters in which he covers the various rules and regulations of sacrificial offerings and slaughtering. So this treatise serves as a valuable guide for those intending to perform the sacrifice on the day of Eid. It is hoped that it will serve as a source of benefit and guidance to English-speaking Muslims throughout the world.</p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The following is posted from Tafseer Ibn Kathir , Darussalam:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice.</strong></span>) meaning, `just as We have given you the abundant goodness in this life and the Hereafter &#8212; and from that is the river that has been described previously &#8212; then make your obligatory and optional prayer, and your sacrifice (of animals) solely and sincerely for your Lord. Woship Him alone and do not associate any partner with him. And sacrifice pronouncing His Name alone, without ascribing any partner to Him.&#8217; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِى وَنُسُكِى وَمَحْيَاىَ وَمَمَاتِى للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ &#8211; لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</strong></span>) (6:162-163)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, `Ata,&#8217; Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan all said, &#8220;This means with this the Budn should be sacrificed.&#8221; Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi`, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, Al-Hakam, Isma`il bin Abi Khalid and others from the Salaf have all said the same. This is the opposite of the way of the idolators, prostrating to other than Allah and sacrificing in other than His Name. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not eat from what Allah&#8217;s Name has not been pronounced over, indeed that is Fisq</span></strong>.) (6:121)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 1474</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q2: Is it permissible for a person to offer an Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) on behalf of a dead person?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: All Muslims have agreed upon its permissibility. So, it is permissible to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of a dead person because of the generality of the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(37. It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is <em><strong>Taqwa</strong> </em>from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) </span>&#8211; Suratul Baqarah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, &#8220;The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<strong>We have more right to do that</strong>.&#8221; Then Allah revealed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)</strong> That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.)</strong> And in the Hadith; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Thus have We made them subject to you)</strong> meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you.)</strong> means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.)</strong> means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,&#8217; i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;<strong>The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years</strong>.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: &#8220;At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting ﴿by sacrificing more than one﴾ and things reached the stage that you see now.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Obligation of Having Sincerity When Slaughtering the Sacrificial Animal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great days of Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day from the month of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of the blessed ‘Eid al-Adha. This day has been called the day of an-Nahr because the Muslims seek closeness to Allaah on that Day by slaughtering grazing livestock (sheep, camels, cattle, goats). Pilgrims on this day slaughter their sacrificial animals and the Muslims in every scattered part of the earth slaughter their sacrificial animals too, seeking closeness to Allaah by doing so, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em><span style="color:#008000;">And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allaah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food. And your (God) is One (God &#8211; Allaah), so you must submit to Him Alone (in Islaam). And give glad tidings to the Mukhbitin [those who obey Allaah with humility and are humble from among the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism],</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allaah is mentioned; who patiently bear whatever may befall them (of calamities); and who perform the prayer and who spend (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have provided them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Budn (cows, oxen, or camels driven to be offered as sacrifices by the pilgrims at the sanctuary of Makkah.) We have made for you as among the Symbols of Allaah, therein you have much good. So mention the Name of Allaah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). Then, when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat thereof, and feed the beggar who does not ask (men), and the beggar who asks (men). Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may magnify Allaah for His Guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (doers of good).</span></em> &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 34-37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: The intent is not just slaughtering but, indeed what has been legislated for you is slaughtering this sacrifice so that you remember Allaah at the slaughter, as He indeed is The Creator and The Provider, it is not that He will take anything from its meat or its blood, for Allaah Ta’ala is in no need of other than Himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt; but it is piety from you that reaches Him&gt;&gt;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: to have sincerity, hope of gaining reward, a good intention and a desire for the Face of Allaah by performing good actions. In 1this is a great encouragement and motivation to have sincerity in slaughtering and that the intent should be the Face of Allaah alone, because Allaah Ta’ala does not accept actions except those that are sincere, with which one only desires the Face of Allaah –Subhanahu- as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;Say: &#8220;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allaah, The Lord of all that exists. He has no partner.  And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;&gt;&gt;</span></em> [Anaam: 162-163]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer –Rahimullaah- said in explanation of this Ayaah: ‘Allaah Ta’ala commands the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to inform the Mushrikeen who worship other than Allaah and slaughter in other than His name, that he is in opposition to them in this. Indeed his prayer is for Allaah and his sacrifices are in the name of Allaah alone, Who has no partner. This is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> [Anaam: 162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that your prayer and your slaughtering should be sincerely for Allaah. Indeed the Mushrikeen used to worship idols and slaughter for them, so Allaah Ta’ala ordered the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to oppose them, to turn away from what they were upon and to face Allaah with purpose, intention and determination, doing so sincerely for Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said regarding Allaah’s saying <strong>&lt;&lt;my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> i.e. ritual: slaughtering in the Hajj and Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said on the authority of Sa’eed bin Jubair who said regarding the word:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> : my slaughtering.</p>
<p>As-Saadi and Dhihaak also said the same thing.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Slaughtering is a great act from the different types of worship with which the Muslims seek nearness to their Lord –Azza wa Jal – fulfilling rites for the sake of Allaah Ta’ala from slaughtering the sacrificial animal to vows to other such things. So it is not permissible to direct these acts of worship to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been established in the authentic book of hadeeth by Muslim from the hadeeth of the Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib –radhiAllaahu anhuwho said: the Messenger of Allaah-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- informed me of four statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Allaah’s curse is upon the one who slaughters for other than Allaah, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who curses his parents, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who gives shelter to an innovator and Allaah’s curse is upon the one who changes signposts which mark directions on the earth.’ [2]</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accursedness meaning exiled and being distant from the Mercy of Allaah. The most dangerous of these four matters, such that the one who does it is deserving of this punishment, is slaughtering for other than Allaah. This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- mentioned it first, which shows the great danger of this matter, as slaughtering for other than Allaah is Shirk, whereas the other points mentioned are from the major sins but they do not reach the level of Shirk. Any type of slaughtering done for other than Allaah is Shirk even if what is slaughtered -seeking closeness to Allaah- is insignificant or small such as a fly or something similar to that. So how about the one seeking closeness while he sacrifices the best and the finest of animals?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his book ‘az-Zuhd’, by Abu Na’eem in his book ‘al-Hileeya’ and in other places on the authority of Salman alFarsi –RadhiAllaahu anhu- with an authentic chain stopping at him, that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘A man entered Paradise due to a fly and another man entered the Fire due to a fly. They asked, ‘How is that?’ He replied: Two men from before your time passed by some people who had an idol and none could pass by them except that he had to sacrifice to their idol.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to one of the two men: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I don’t have anything.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said: Sacrifice something, even if it is a fly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he sacrificed a fly and passed by, then entered the Hell-fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to the other man: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I never sacrifice anything for other than Allaah –Azza wa Jal. So they chopped his head off and he entered Paradise.’[3]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows the wickedness of Shirk and the severity of its danger that, even if it is with something small, it obligates entry into Hell-fire. So, when the first man sacrificed a despicable and the vilest of animals, a fly, for the idol his reward was the Fire due to him committing Shirk in the worship of Allaah. If this is the case of the one who sacrificed by slaughtering a fly, then what is the state of the one who fattens a camel or a sacrificial animal then slaughters it for the one he worships other than Allaah such as graves, tombs, stones, trees or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- said in his book ‘Sharh as-Sadoor’: ‘This is from the causes of extreme evil, by which the evil companion is thrown behind the wall of Islaam from the highest point of the Deen and lands on his skull. So much so that many of them come with the best of the livestock they possess and the most excellent of what they have of sheep and cattle, then they slaughter them at the graves seeking closeness to them and hoping that this (closeness) can be attained from the graves. So they sacrifice for other than Allaah and, as a result, they worship one from amongst the idols, because there is no difference between slaughtering for the erected stones they call idols and slaughtering for and at the grave of the deceased calling it a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple difference in description does not affect something’s being Halaal or being Haram. The one who calls alcohol by other than its true name and drinks it has the same ruling as the one who calls alcohol by its name and drinks it, there is no difference of opinion amongst any of the Muslims in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that slaughtering is one type from the different types of worship for Allaah, similar to slaughtering the sacrificial animal and atonement. So the one who seeks closeness to the inhabitant of the grave and slaughters for it does not have any other intent in so-doing except to glorify and honour the grave, to seek to attain goodness from it and to fend off evil due to it. This is, no doubt, worship and it suffices as evil just to hear of it. There is no power or might except with Allaah, The Most High, The Most Great, to Allaah we belong and to Him is our return. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘In Islaam there is no slaughtering animals near graves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq Sanaani said: ‘They used to slaughter at the grave, i.e. cows and sheep’ as narrated by Abu Daawood with an authentic chain of narration on the authority of Anas ibn Maalik.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- was very eloquent in his advice and very good in warning against this dangerous issue. We ask Allaah, The Most Noble that He saves us all from falling into any of this and that He makes all our actions sincerely for His Noble Face, in accordance with the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Indeed Allaah is The Most Generous and The Most Noble.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <em><a style="text-decoration:none;" href="#">    </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 22: </font></p>
<p></a></em>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Sacrifices (Kitab Al-Adahi)  </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Religion, at its highest and best, is the devotion of the  total self, through service and adoration, to the Almighty Who controls the universe. In  this sense all the manifold rites, consecrations, and purifications, offerings and sacred  feasts, all the working of asceticism and morality are only the indirect expression of the  inner experience of religion-the experience of trust, surrender, yearning and enthusiasm.  Sacrifice, whether that of wealth or desires, is the practical proof of man&#8217;s devotion to  his Creator. It is in fact religion in action. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an expresses this attitude of mind and heart  in the following words:&#8221; Say: Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, and my  living and my dying are for God (alone), the Sustainer of all the worlds, in Whose  Divinity none has a share. Thus I have been bidden-and I am foremost among those who  surrender themselves unto Him&#8221; (vi. 162-163). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The &#8216;Id al-Adha is commemorative of that unparalleled act  of devotion of that noble soul. Abraham (peace be upon him), who, in obedience to the  Command of his Lord, readily offered the life of his son Isma&#8217;il. The Holy Qur&#8217;an narrates  this soul- stirring event in these words:&#8221; And when he (Isma&#8217;il) attained the age to  assist him in his (Abrahm&#8217;s) work, he (Abraham) said: O my son! I see in vision that I  offer thee in sacrifice. Now see what is thy view. The son said: O my father, do as thou  art commanded. Thou wilt find me, if God so wills, patient. So when they both had  surrendered themselves to (Allah), and he laid him down prostrate on his forehead (for  sacrifice), We called out to him: O Abraham, thou hast indeed fulfilled the vision. Thus  do We reward the doers of good. Surely this is a manifest trial. And We ransom- ed him  with a great sacrifice. And We left (this blessing) for him among the later generations.  Peace be upon Abraham I Thus indeed do We reward those who do good; for he was one of Our  believing servants&#8221; (xxxvii. 102-111) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the above-quoted verses &#8216;axim (great), the adjective  qualifying&#8221; Sacrifice.&#8221; may be understood both in literal and figurative sense.  In literal sense it implies that a big ram was substituted. The figurative sense is even  more important. It was indeed a great and momentous occasion, when two men with  concentrated will ranged themselves in ranks of those to whom self-sacrifice in the  service of God was the supreme thing in life. Similarly, the words&#8221; thou hast indeed  fulfilled the vision&#8221; show that it was not in fact the act of slaughtering which was  needed for the fulfilment of the vision, but it was the attitude of submission and  surrender, an attitude of preparedness to sacrifice one&#8217;s all in the path of Allah. that  was demanded of Abraham and his illustrious son, and they eminently stood this test. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Readiness to Sacrifice One&#8217;s Life. In Islam the act of  sacrifice is the symbol of a Muslim&#8217;s readiness to lay down his life, and to sacrifice all  his interests and desires in the cause of truth. The purpose of sacrifice is not fulfilled  only by shedding the blood of an animal, but it is really fulfilled when a man submits  himself completely to the command of Allah. This has been clearly laid down in Sura Hajj,  verse 37;&#8221; Not their flesh, nor their blood reaches Allah, but it is the piety from  you that reaches Him.&#8221; This verse eloquently speaks of the fact that sacrifice in  Islam is nothing else than a natural expression of homage and gratitude to the Creator. It  is the spirit of willing devotion and cheerful obedience underlying sacrifices that is  accepted by Allah Who is the Fountainhead of all morality. It is only piety of heart.  nobility of soul and righteousness of conduct, that is acceptable to Him. It is  essentially symbolic, an external symbol of dedication, devotion to Allah. Tafsir Ibn  Kathir stresses this point:&#8221; The man who offers sacrifice should keep this fact  uppermost in his mind that the most important motive behind this is the willing submission  to Allah&#8221; &#8216; (Vol. VI, p. 183). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such truths, so self-evident to the Muslim readers, needed  a clear and emphatic enunciation in view of the horrible misconceptions which had crowded  round the act of sacrifice before Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Throughout the Semitic field,&#8221; observes  Robertson Smith, in his well known book. The Religion of the Semitics, the fundamental  idea of sacrifice was that of communion between the God and his worshipper by joint  participation in the living flesh and blood of a sacred victim&#8221; (p. 49). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The Greeks also looked upon sacrifice as a  &#8216;Communion feast&#8217; with the Divinity, in which the God and his people became of one flesh  by partaking together of the flesh of the victim; the animal was regarded, as in some  degree, divine, as having the divine spirit incarnate in it. Among the Babylonians the  gods feast in heaven, they eat the offerings, they scent the savour, like flies do they  gather themselves together with the offerers&#8221; (Hastings, Encyclopedia of Rdigion  &amp; Ethics, Article&#8221; Sacrifice&#8221; ). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an strikes at the very root of such wrong  concepts of sacrifice and asserts that&#8221; it is neither the flesh nor the blood of  (animals) that reaches Allah, but it is your piety that reaches Him,&#8221; for God does  not stand In need of food or blood. What He, in fact, desires is the devotion and piety of  our hearts. and, as a symbol of such offer, the visible institution of sacrifice has been  instituted. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has further elucidated the main parpose of the institution of  sacrifice.&#8221; For every people did We appoint rites (of sacrifice) that they might  celebrate the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from animals (fit for food).  But your God is One God. Sub- mit then your wills to him (in Islam)&#8230;. The sacrificial  camels We have made for you as among the symbols from God. In them is (much) good for you  So mention the name of Allah on them standing in a row. Then when they fall down on their  sides, eat of them, feed the contented one and the beggar. Thus have We made them  subservient to you that you may be grateful&#8221; (xxii. 34-38). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Qur&#8217;an testifies to the historical fact that whatever  may be the outward symbols of sacrifice, it has been accepted in one form or another by  all the nations of the world. It had been a fundamental element of both Jewish and Gentile  religions, and Christianity. It had been corrupted by many wrong practices and been  overlaid by many wrong notions before the advent of Islam. Islam purifies it from all  wrong notions and practices connected with it, and makes it explicitly clear that the act  of sacrifice is an outward symbol of man&#8217;s readiness to lay down his life, if required,  and to surrender all his interests in the cause of truth and righteousness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The words&#8221; We have made them (subservient) to  you&#8221; have a very wide significance. A Muslim has been awakened to the realisation of  the fact that if they offer as a sacrifice an animal over which they hold control, it is  their bounden duty to lay down their lives in the way of Allah, Who is not only their  Master, but also their Creator and Sustainer and Who. therefore, exercises a far greater  authority over them than they do over the animals. This should be the true motive of  sacrifice, and it is with this spirit that this act should be performed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Qur&#8217;anic words&#8221; To Him is acceptable observance of  duty on your part&#8221; make it abundantly clear that the prevalent idea of atonement  that&#8221; it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul&#8221; (Leviticus; 17: 11)  has no foundation in Islam. The expiation of sin in Islam rests entirely on the good deeds  of men, repentance of the Winners and the Forgiving and Merciful nature of God &#8216;This fact  cuts the ground from under the feet of any theory of an atoning sacrifice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The opening verse&#8221; For every people did We appoint  rites (of sacrifice) that they might celebrate the name of God over the beast cattle  wherewith He bath provided them,&#8221; speaks of the fact that the very idea of human  sacrifice is repugnant to the true religion and Allah has never given it sanction. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>This practice of human sacrifice was not uncommon before  Islam.&#8221; Both on the mainland of Greece and in the Greek colonies human sacrifice was  practised, usually as a means towards expulsion of evil&#8221; (Encydopaedia Britannica,  Article&#8217;on&#8221; Sacrifice&#8221; ). it occupied a prominent place in the ritual of the  mother goddesses of ancient times. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The ordinary form of sacrifice,&#8221; says E. O.  James, in his famous book, The origins of Sacrifice,&#8221; consisted in stripping the  victim of his ornaments, stretching him over the convex sacrificial stones and while fare  priests held his arms, legs, head, the high priests or sacrificer cut open his breast with  a flint or obsidian knife, and tore out the heart. This was held up to the sun to provide  it with nourishment, before it was cast into a basin of Copal placed in a position to  enable the blood and incense to ascend to the gods. The body was hurled down the steps of  the temple to the court where it was seized by the priest or by the warrior who captured  the victim. Some times a solemn feast was then held on the flesh, the skin having first  been removed to be worn ceremonially by men who seem to have acquired thereby the  fertilising nd health-giving qualities of the victim. Some of the blood was carried to  certain temples and smeared on the hips of the images of gods&#8221; (pp. 84-6). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has not only exterminated the very idea of human  sacrifice, but has completely ended all such inhuman practices which were very common with  the people before Islam. The Holy Qur&#8217;an makes a pointed reference to the fact that this  sacrifice of animals is commemorative of Abraham&#8217;s offer of his son&#8217;s life at the Command  of Allah, who was substituted by a ram, and it has been perpetuated by Islam. It is  narrated that once the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) asked him  about the sacrifice. He replied:&#8221; This is commemorative Sunnah of your father  Abraham&#8221; (vide Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, p. 221). That this practice of sacrifice was  already prevalent amongst the people before Islam can be well borne out by the fact that  we find clear references to it in the poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia. The well. known poet  Umayya observes: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abraham was one who would fulfil the pledges and offer  sacrifices for Allah&#8217;s sake. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thus he offered the life of his only son whose separation  and whose risk of life, he could not bear. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said,&#8221; O my son I have pledged you to Allah. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>May I sacrifice my life for you! </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Be steadfast and firm.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He had hardly taken off the shirt of his son, when Allah  substituted Isma&#8217;il by a stout ram. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not only this practice of sacrifice has been preserved in  Islam, but even the way of Abraham&#8217;s has been declared to he one of righteousness and  truthfulness: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Say: Behold, my Lord has guided me to a way that is  straight-a religion of Right Path-the Path (trodden) by Abraham, who was wholly devoted to  God, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to any beside him&#8221; (vi. 161). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Even the Millat has been assigned a name after the name of  Abraham: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; He hath selected you and hath not placed upon you  any hardship in religion-the religion of your father, Abraham. He named you Muslims before  this, and in this, that the Messenger may be a witness to you and you may he witnesses to  mankind&#8221; (xxii. 78). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Historical Continuity, The constant reference to the  earlier Prophets and the Qur&#8217;anic testimony to their righteousness and the preservation of  some of their religious practices have been done to awaken the people to the realisation  of a fundamental fact, i. e. the fact of the historical continuity of religious  experience. The Muslims have been asked to believe in that which has been revealed unto  Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) as well as in that which was revealed before him.  Life-so the Qur&#8217;an teaches us-is not a series of disconnected parts but a continuous,  organic process: and this law applies also to the law of the mind, of which man&#8217;s  religious experience (in its cumulative sense) is a part. To make religious experience  more living, to set Allah the Ever-living with loving vividness before the eyes of living  men, to make them feel Him as actually and eternally present in their lives, man needs a  path, clear-cut path, lightened with glories of the Messengers of Allah-a path on which  one should not feel lonely but the strength of comradeship of those noble souls upon whom  Allah has bestowed His choicest blessings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A few words may be said about the way how an animal should  be slaughtered according to the teachings of Islam. Three are the aims which should be  kept before the mind while slaughtering the animal: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It should be slaughtered by reciting the name of Allah and  glorifying Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It should be slaughtered with a sharp knife so that its  jugular vein may be cut with the minimum possible pain and its skin should not be removed  and limbs should not be cut so long as there is any sign of life in it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The head should not be removed from the body abruptly but  only the jugular vein should be cut so that even the last drop of blood flows out of its  body. If the animal is beheaded with a stroke, the blood congeals in its veins which makes  the flesh distasteful and pernicious to health. </font></p>

I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy    Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did    not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I    throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game).    Thereupon he said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly    (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that.</font></p>

I asked the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he said. When you    send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but if some    part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has caught that    (the-game) for itself.

And he found for us nothing    besides it. Abu Ubaida gave each of us one date (everyday). I (Abu Zubair, one of the    narrators) said: What did you do with that? He said: We sucked that just as a baby sucks    and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. We beat off    leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then    went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of the sea something    like a big mound. We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-&#8216;Anbar    (spermaceti whale). Abu &#8216;Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not    matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the path    of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you eat that.    We three hundred in number stayed there for a month, until we grew bulky. He (Jabir) said:    I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and    sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaida called    forth thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold    of one of the ribs of its chest and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the    camels we had with us and it passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves    with pieces of boiled meat (especially for use in our journey). When we came back to    Medina, we went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to    him, whereupon he said: That was a provision which Allah had brought forth for you. Is    there any piece of meat (left) with you, so tnat you give to us that?

We were three hundred riders and our chief    (leader) was &#8216;Ubaida b. al-Jarrah. We were on the look out for a caravan of the Quraish.    So we stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much afflicted by extreme hunger    that we (were obliged) to eat leaves. That is why it was called the Detachment of the    Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-&#8216;Anbar (whale). We ate of    that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became    stout. Abu &#8216;Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance    at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over    that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its    eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the cavity of its eye. We had small    bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). &#8216;Ubaida gave every person    amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave each one of    us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.068.453"></a>Volume 7, Book 68, Number 453:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offer the (&#8216;Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&#8221; (On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, &#8220;I have got a six month old ram.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#8217; added: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, he just slaughtered it for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet distributed among his companions some animals for sacrifice (to be slaughtered on &#8216;Id-al-Adha). &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s share was a Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old goat). &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I get in my share of Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old ram).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said on the day of Nahr, &#8220;Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another sacrifice).&#8221; A man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a day on which meat is desired.&#8221; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &#8220;I have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and then the people went towards some sheep and distributed them among themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&#8217;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#8217;ban. The Prophet then asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and his Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it the town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What day is today?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&#8221; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I delivered (Allah&#8217;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#8217;t I delivered Allah&#8217;s message (to you)?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet gave him some sheep to distribute among his companions to slaughter as sacrifices (&#8216;Id&#8211;al&#8211;Adha). A kid was left and he told the Prophet of that whereupon he said to him, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice (on your behalf).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 463:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An uncle of mine called Abu Burda, slaughtered his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Your (slaughtered) sheep was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got a domestic kid.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be permissible for anybody other than you&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before the (&#8216;Id) prayer, he only slaughtered for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he offered his sacrifice properly and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 464:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Burda slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the (&#8216;Id) prayer whereupon the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Slaughter another sacrifice instead of that.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have nothing except a Jadha&#8217;a.&#8221; (Shu&#8217;ba said: Perhaps Abu Burda also said that Jadha&#8217;a was better than an old sheep in his opinion.) The Prophet said, &#8220;(Never mind), slaughter it to make up for the other one, but it will not be sufficient for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 465:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered upon me at Sarif while I was weeping (because I was afraid that I would not be able to perform the ,Hajj). He said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform the ceremonies of the Hajj as the pilgrims do, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon, and he said (on the Day of &#8216;Id-Allah. a), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours is that we will offer the &#8216;Id prayer, then we will return and slaughter our sacrifices; and whoever does so, then indeed he has followed our tradition, and whoever slaughtered his sacrifice (before the prayer), what he offered was just meat that he presented to his family, and that was not a sacrifice.&#8221; Abu Burda got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer and I have got a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than an old sheep.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it to make up for that, but it will not be sufficient for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>

The man said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is to me better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not.

I have already done it. The Prophet said, &#8220;That is something you have done before its due time.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than two old sheep; shall I slaughter it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, but it will not be sufficient for anyone after you.&#8221;</p>

Masruq added, I heard the clapping of her hands behind the curtain. She said, &#8220;I used to twist the garlands for the Hadi of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he used to send his Hadi to Ka&#8217;ba but he never used to regard as unlawful what was lawful for men to do with their wives till the people returned (from the Hajj).&#8221;</p>

(In his narration) Abu Sa&#8217;id added: I got up and went to my brother, Abu Qatada (who was his maternal brother and was one of the warriors of the battle of Badr) and mentioned that to him He Sad. &#8216;A new verdict was given in your absence (i.e., meat of sacrifices was allowed to be stored and eaten later on).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">the freed slave of Ibn Azhar that he witnessed the Day of &#8216;Id-al-Adha with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar offered the &#8216;Id prayer before the sermon and then delivered the sermon before the people, saying, &#8220;O people! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden you to fast (on the first day of) each of these two &#8216;Ida, for one of them is the Day of breaking your fast, and the other is the one, on which you eat the meat of your sacrifices.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 479:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Ubaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in continuation of 478). Then I witnessed the &#8216;Id with &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan, and that was on a Friday. He offered the prayer before the sermon, saying, &#8220;O people! Today you have two &#8216;Its (festivals) together, so whoever of those who live at Al-&#8216;Awali (suburbs) would like to wait for the Jumua prayer, he may wait, and whoever would like to return (home) Is granted my permission to do so.&#8221; Then I witnessed (the &#8216;Its) with &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib, and he too offered the &#8216;Id prayer before the sermon and then delivered the sermon before the people and said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden you to eat the meat of your sacrifices for more than three days.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Sacrifice on Occasion of Birth (`Aqiqa)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.066.376"></a>Volume 7, Book 66, Number 376:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A son was born to me and I took him to the Prophet who named him Ibrahim, did Tahnik for him with a date, invoked Allah to bless him and returned him to me. (The narrator added: That was Abu Musa&#8217;s eldest son.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A boy was brought to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him, but the boy urinated on him, whereupon the Prophet had water poured on the place of urine.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conceived &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba&#8217;, and gave birth at Quba&#8217;. Then I brought the child to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379p:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, &#8220;How does my son fare?&#8221; Um Salaim (his wife) replied, &#8220;He is quieter than he has ever been.&#8221; Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), &#8220;Bury the child (as he&#8217;s dead).&#8221; Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Did you sleep with your wife last night?&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.&#8221; Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, &#8220;Yes, a few dates.&#8221; The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child&#8217;s mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman bin &#8216;Amir Ad-Dabbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering.&#8221; (Note: It has been quoted in Fateh-AL-Bari that the majority of the Religious Scholars agrees to the Hadith narrated in Sahih At-TlRMlZY that the Prophet was asked about Aqiqa and he ordered 2 sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl and that is his tradition &#8220;SUNNA&#8221;.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Habib bin Ash-Shahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sirin told me to ask Al-Hassan from whom he had heard the narration of &#8216;Aqiqa. I asked him and he said, &#8220;From Samura bin Jundab.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (of camels or sheep) which the pagans used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols.

<h3 align="center">Hunting, Slaughtering</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.067.384"></a>Volume 7, Book 67, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, &#8220;If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah&#8217;s name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Mi&#8217;rad. He said, &#8220;If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but if the Mi&#8217;rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;If I let loose my trained hound after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If the hound eats of the game?&#8221; He said &#8220;Then you should not eat of it, for the hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Some times I send my hound and then I find some other hound with it?&#8221; He said &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Allah on your dog only and not on the other.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We let loose our trained hounds after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat what they hunt for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if they killed (the game)?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;Even if they killed (the game).&#8221; I said, &#8216;We also hit (the game) with the Mi&#8217;rad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat of the animal which the Mi&#8217;rad kills by piercing its body, but do not eat of the animal which is killed by the broad side of the Mi&#8217;rad.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maghaffal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, &#8220;Do not throw stones, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden throwing stones, or e used to dislike it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth or gouge out an eye.&#8221; Afterwards &#8216;Abdullah once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, &#8220;I tell you that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet you are throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for hunting, nor for guarding livestock, the reward (for his good deeds) will be reduced by two Qirats per day.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 391:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for guarding livestock, nor for hunting, his good deeds will decrease (in reward) by two Qirats a day.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 392:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;We hunt with the help of these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat what the hounds catch for you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for then it is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound in hunting the game, then do not eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah&#8217;s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it.&#8221; And it has also been narrated by &#8216;Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet &#8220;If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;He can eat if he wishes.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 394:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it has killed it for itself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You must not eat of it because you have not mentioned, the Name of Allah except on sending your own hound, and you did not mention it on the other hound.&#8221; Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side (shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a pie</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 395:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi Bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;We hunt with these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 396:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name while hunting, then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 397:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We provoked a rabbit at Marr Az-Zahran till it started jumping. My companions chased it till they got tired. But I alone ran after it and caught it and brought it to Abu Talha. He sent both its legs to the Prophet who accepted them.</p>

When he had covered some of the way to Mecca, he and some companions of his, who were in the state of lhram. remained behind the Prophet while Abu Qatada himself was not in the state of Ihram. Abu Qatada, seeing an onager rode his horse and asked his companions to hand him a whip, but they refused. He then asked them to hand him his spear, but they refused. Then he took it himself and attacked the onager and killed it. Some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ate of it, but some others refused to eat. When they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked him about that. He said, &#8220;It was meal given to you by Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 399:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with the Prophet (on a journey) between Mecca and Medina, and all of them, (i.e. the Prophet and his companions) were in the state of Ihram, while I was not in that state. I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It is an onager.&#8217; They said, &#8220;It is what you have seen.&#8221; I had left my whip, so I said to them, &#8220;Hand to me my whip.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager).&#8221; I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, &#8220;Come on, carry it!&#8221; But they said, &#8220;We will not even touch it.&#8221; At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), &#8220;I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf).&#8221; When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, &#8220;Has anything of it been left with you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out in a campaign and the army was called The Army of the Khabt, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida was our commander. We were struck with severe hunger. Then the sea threw a huge dead fish called Al-&#8216;Anbar, the like of which had never been seen. We ate of it for half a month, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida took one of its bones (and made an arch of it) so that a rider could easily pass under it.</p>

But we were struck with such severe hunger that we ate the Khabt (desert bushes), so our army was called the Army of the Khabt. Then the sea threw a huge fish called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till our bodies became healthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a rider passed underneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger became severe, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so.</p>

Then he distributed the animals, regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels ran away and there were a few horses with the people. They chased the camel but they got tired, whereupon a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Among these animals some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away from you, treat it in this way.&#8221; I said. &#8220;We hope, or we are afraid that tomorrow we will meet the enemy and we have no knives, shall we slaughter (our animals) with canes?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If the killing tool causes blood to gush out and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned, eat (of the slaughterer animal). But do not slaughter with a tooth or a nail. I am telling you why: A tooth is a bone, and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the company of Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari and there were friendly relations between us and this tribe of Jarm. Abu Musa was presented with a dish containing chicken. Among the people there was sitting a red-faced man who did not come near the food. Abu Musa said (to him), &#8220;Come on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &#8216; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &#8216;I have nothing to mount you on&#8217; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked twice, &#8216;Where are Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&#8217;s Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; He said, &#8216;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A mouse fell into the butter-fat and died. The Prophet was asked about that. He said, &#8220;Throw away the mouse and the butter-fat that surrounded it, and eat the rest of the butter-fat (As-Samn).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 447:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zhuri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding an animal, e.g., a mouse or some other animal that had fallen into solid or liquid oil or butter-fat: I had been informed that a mouse had died in butter-fat whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that the butter-fat near it be thrown away and the rest of the butter-fat can be eaten.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 448:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was asked about a mouse that had fallen into butter-fat (and died). He said, &#8220;Throw away the mouse and the portion of butter-fat around it, and eat the rest.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 449:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Ibn &#8216;Umar disliked the branding of animals on the face. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet forbade beating (animals) on the face.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 450:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I brought a brother of mine to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him while the Prophet was in a sheep fold of his, and I saw him branding a sheep. (The sub-narrator said: I think Anas said, branding it on the ear.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rait&#8217; bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet, &#8220;We will be facing the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives (for slaughtering)&#8217; He said, &#8220;If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, unless the killing instrument is a tooth or nail. I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221; The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet was behind the people. So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these animals there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 452:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were with the Prophet. on a journey, one of the camels ran away. A man shot it with an arrow and stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these camels some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away and you cannot catch it, then do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we have no knives.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is forbidden to carry out an act of obedience to Allah and His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in a place used to carry out acts of disobedience to Allah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and that includes slaughtering animals in a place where animals are slaughtered for others besides Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">That it proves the prohibition of all things which might lead in the end to Shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of Thabit Ibn Adh-Dhahhak (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he said: &#8220;A man vowed to sacrifice a camel at a place called Buwanah, and he asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said to him: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Does the place contain any of the idols from the time of the Jahiliyyah?</strong></span>&#8221; They said: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then asked: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Did the disbelievers hold any of their (religious) festivals there?</strong></span>&#8221; They replied: &#8220;No.&#8221; So the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Then fulfill your vow, for verily, vows, which entail disobedience to Allah or that which is beyond the capacity of the son of Adam should not be fulfilled.&#8221; </em></span>(Narrated by Abu Dawood, with a Sanad that meets the conditions of acceptance laid down by Bukhari and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thabit Ibn Adh-Dhahak (Radhi Allaahu Anhu) informs us that a man made a vow to slaughter a female camel in a place called Buwanah, and so the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) enquired as to whether it had been used as a place of worship for the idols of the Jahiliyyah or whether any of their pagan festivals had been celebrated there. When it was made clear to him that this was not the case, he ordered the man to fulfill his vow. In addition to this, he then gave a general ruling binding upon his Ummah until the Day of Ressurrection, prohibiting the fulfillment of vows made in disobedience to Allah or which require of man what is beyond his capacity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 4: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it true that a person who testifies that Allah is the Creator and Provider,and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Allah&#8217;s Messenger, and performs Salah (Prayer) is a Muslim even if they make Sujud (Prostration) to their shaykh and offer sacrifices for people other than Allah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Sujud and sacrificing for anyone other than Allah is Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). People who indulge in any of these practices after being aware of the ruling of doing so, are Mushriks (people who associate others with Allah in worship) and Kafirs (disbelievers). Allah will not accept any of their deeds even if they offer Sawm (Fast) and Salah. Deeds of Mushriks are rejected. Moreover, if they die in this case, Allah will not forgive them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> But if they had joined in worship others with Allâh, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them. But if they return to Allah in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) before death, Allah will forgive them</strong>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: “O ‘Ibâdî (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh: verily, Allâh forgives all sins</strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim scholars unanimously agree that this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) speaks about repentant people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ayah of Surah Al-Nissa&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills</strong> ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it speaks about the unrepentant people, namely, those who died in Kufr (disbelief) and sin. May Allah protect us from that.</p>
<p><span style="color:#888888;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The one who intends to do a sacrifice should not cut his hair and nails</strong><br />
<strong> from the beginning of Dhul-Hijjah UNTIL the sacrifice is done. </strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Al-Albaanee, may Allah shower His Mercy upon him, states in our of his works:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘When the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah appears and one of you wants to do the sacrifice, then he should abstain from (cutting) his hair and his nails<a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Bf" target="_blank">.</a>’</em> </span></p>
<p>And in a narration:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘Then he should not take anything from his hair or from his nails until he sacrifices.’</em></span></p>
<p> – Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim No<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Bf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span>1251 and other than it.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albaani</strong>, may Allah shower his Mercy upon Him, comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I say: And the apparent meaning of the hadeeth is the obligation to leave removing the hair and the nails for the one who has resolved to do the sacrifice until he sacrifices &#8230; and this is what Imaam Ahmad and other than him have said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, let those who are afflicted with the shaving of the beard pay attention to this, for indeed shaving it (the beard) for ‘Eed has in it three acts of disobedience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First</strong>: The shaving in of itself, for indeed it is to become feminine and to resemble the disbelievers and to change the creation of Allah as I have explained it in my book Adaab-uz-Zifaaf Fis-Sunnatil-Mutahharah (6th Edition, page 118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second</strong>: Beautifying (oneself) for the ‘Eed through the disobedience of Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third</strong>: What this hadeeth has benefitted with from the forbidding of taking (from) the hair for the one who wants to sacrifice. And in reality, very few are those who are saved from these violations (of the religion), even some of the people of knowledge! We ask Allah for safety.”</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q 1: If a neighbor is a Kafir (non-Muslim), but he never disturbs me with regard to ‘Ibadah (worship); is it permissible to give him from the Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) and from the ‘Aqiqah (sacrifice for a newborn)? Respected Shaykh, we hope you will clarify this issue for us.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to give a Kafir from the meat of an Ud-hiyah or ‘Aqiqah, as a way of showing kindness to the neighbor and fulfilling our Islamic duty as neighbors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8211; One Udhiyah is sufficient on behalf of a man and the members of his household<br />
&#8211; Ud-hiyah offered by your father is not sufficient for you if you are living with your family in a separate house</p>
<p><a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=1&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fatwas</a> &gt; <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=126&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dhul-Hijjah Fatwas</a> &gt; What is the ruling on Ud-hiyah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am married, praise be to Allah, and I have children. I live in a city other than the city in which my family lives, but on holidays I go to the city where my family is. On ‘Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice), my children and I came five days before the ‘Eid but we did not offer the Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) even though I am able to, praise be to Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for me to offer Ud-hiyah? Is my father’s Ud-hiyah valid on behalf of myself and my wife and children? What is the ruling on Ud-hiyah for the one who is financially able? Is it obligatory on the one who is not able? Is it permissible to take a loan in order to offer the Ud-hiyah? A.A.Sh. Rafha’ the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Ud-hiyah is a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet), not Wajib (obligatory), and one sheep is sufficient on behalf of a man and the members of his household, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to sacrifice two-horned rams that were white speckled with black, every year; one on behalf of himself and the members of his household, and the other on behalf of those among his Ummah (nation based on one creed) who believe in the Oneness of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you, dear questioner, are living in a separate house, then the Ud-hiyah offered by your father on behalf of himself and the members of his household is not sufficient for you, because you are not living with them in the same house. It is prescribed for you to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of yourself and your family. There is nothing wrong with a Muslim taking a loan to offer Ud-hiyah if he is able to repay it. May Allah grant us all success</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling on a Woman&#8217;s Slaughter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:<br />
Is it permissible for a woman to slaughter an animal? And is it permissible to eat from it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for a woman to slaughter an animal, the same as a man, as has been confirmed by the Sunnah from the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam. It is permissible to eat from the animal she has slaughtered, if she is a Muslim or one of the People of the Scripture and the animal was slaughtered according to the Islamic Law, even if a man was available to do it for her. It is not a condition for the permissibility of her sacrificial animal that there be no man present.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The first question of Fatwa no. 7465</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: What is the ruling on sacrificing an animal at a specific date and time every year? Many people believe that slaughtering on the 27th of Rajab, 6th of Safar, 15th of Shawwal and 10th of Muharram draw them close to Allah and is an act of ‘Ibadah (worship). Are these acts valid? Are they acts of Sunnah or Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) that contradicts Islam and its doer will not be rewarded for them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>All acts of ‘Ibadah that draw a Muslim close to Allah are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no textual proof from the Qur’an or the authentic Sunnah that dictate a particular sacrifice on the mentioned days of these months</strong>. The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them) did not do so either and therefore, this is Bid‘ah. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" /><a> Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" />(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> SOURCE: Talkhees Ahkaam-ul-Udhiyah wadh-Dhakaat </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are certain etiquettes one must abide by when slaughtering an animal for a sacrificial offering. However, these etiquettes are not conditional for the validity of a sacrifice. So the sacrifice is still valid even in their absence. Among these etiquettes are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He should face the Qiblah with the animal at the time of slaughtering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He must slaughter the animal in a good manner, which is by quickly and firmly passing a sharpened blade over the neck area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars hold the view that this etiquette is obligatory based on the implication found in the Prophet’s saying: &#8220;Verily Allaah has prescribed proficiency in everything. So when you kill, kill proficiently. And when you sacrifice, sacrifice proficiently. Each of you should sharpen his blade and lessen the pain inflicted on his sacrificial offering.&#8221; [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This opinion is the correct view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The slaughter of a camel must be done by cutting the area just below the neck and above the chest. This is known as nahr. As for all other types of animals, their necks should be sliced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A camel should be slaughtered while standing and with its (front) left leg tied. If it is difficult to do it this way, the camel can be slaughtered while kneeling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for all of the other animals, they are to be slaughtered while lying flat on their left side. However, if the one slaughtering is a lefty, he may use his left hand and lay the animal down on its right side. This is so long as doing it this way is easier upon the animal and more convenient for the one slaughtering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also prescribed for him to place his foot on the collar of the animal to give him better control. As for making the animal kneel and tying its legs together, there is no basis for this in the Sunnah. Some scholars mentioned that one of the reasons why the legs should not be tied is so that the outflow of blood can increase as a result of the animal’s constant motion and instability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The throat and esophagus of the animal should be cut in addition to its jugular veins. For more on this, refer to the discussion on this under the eighth condition of slaughtering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The blade should be concealed from the view of the animal when sharpening it. This means that the animal should not see the blade until the time of the actual slaughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. One should glorify Allaah (by saying <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) after mentioning His Name (by saying Bismillaah) when slaughtering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. One should name the person whom the sacrificial offering (<em>udhiyah</em>) or ‘aqeeqah is being performed for after mentioning Allaah’s Name and glorifying Him. He should also ask Allaah to accept it from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, he should say: &#8220;In the Name of Allaah, Allaah is the Greatest. O Allaah, this is from You and for You on behalf of me&#8221; if he is performing the slaughter for himself or &#8220;…on behalf of so and so&#8221; if the slaughter is being done on behalf of someone else. And he should say: &#8220;O Allaah, accept this from me&#8221; if he is performing the slaughter for himself or &#8220;…accept this from so and so&#8221; if the slaughter is being done on behalf of someone else.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>There are six conditions that a sacrificial offering (</em><em>udhiyah</em>) must meet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Condition: </strong>The sacrificial offering must be an animal from among cattle, which include camels and cows, or smaller livestock such as sheep and goats. This is based on Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies that they may mention the Name of Allaah over the beasts of cattle that He has given them for food.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term <strong>“beasts of cattle”</strong> refers to camels, cows, sheep and goats. This definition is well known amongst the Arabs as stated by Al-Hasan, Qataadah, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Condition:</strong> It must have reached the required age that is in accordance with the religious standards such as six-months for sheep and one-year and up for everything else. The Prophet said: <strong>“Do not slaughter any animal except for one that is mature in age unless that is difficult for you, in which case you may slaughter a premature one from among sheep.”</strong> [Reported by Muslim] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Mature in age”</strong> is the age at which an animal is considered fully developed as well as any age beyond that, while <strong>“premature”</strong> is the age before that. With respect to a camel, a mature-aged one is one that has completed five years. With respect to a cow, a mature-aged one is one that has completed two years. A mature-aged sheep is that which is one-year old while a premature sheep is one that has competed half a year (up to one year).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, it is invalid to slaughter a camel, cow, and goat if it is under its respective <strong>“mature”</strong> age as well as a sheep if it is under six months of age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Condition:</strong> The animal must be free of any defect that would prevent its slaughter from being valid and acceptable. These defects are of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Clear defectiveness of the eye: This is when the animal’s eye becomes sunken or it sticks out to the point that it looks like a knob or it becomes a pale white indicating clearly that it is one-eyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Clear illness: This is when the animal exhibits signs of sickness, such as a fever that keeps it from grazing and causes a loss of appetite, or an obvious scabies infection that will spoil its meat and harm a person’s health (if he eats it), or a deep wound that threatens to affect its health and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Clear limping: This is when the animal is unable to step safely (without hurting itself) when walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Emaciation that causes brain loss: This is based on what the Prophet said when he was asked about what types of animals one should avoid when sacrificing. He gestured with his hand and said: <strong>“They are four: The lame animal that clearly walks crookedly; the one-eyed animal that clearly has a defect in the eye; the sick animal that clearly has signs of illness; and the emaciated animal that is (usually) not picked.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth was reported by Maalik in al-Muwatta from Al-Baraa’ bin ‘Aazib. In another version of this report narrated by Al-Baraa’ found in the <em>Sunan</em> collections, he said: “The Messenger of Allaah stood up amongst us and said: <strong>‘Four types (of animals) are not permissible to use as sacrificial offerings…’</strong> and he went on to mention them.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore if these four defects are found in an animal, they prevent its slaughter and sacrifice from being valid. This goes as well for any other defect that is similar to or worse than these, which means that it is also not valid to sacrifice the following types of animals:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A blind animal that cannot see with both its eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. An animal suffering from nausea until it releases its load and its harm is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. An animal that has been assisted in giving birth if natural delivery is difficult until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. An animal afflicted by something fatal such as choking, falling from a high place, and so on until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. A crippled animal, which is an animal that cannot walk due to a physical disability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An animal with one of its front legs or back legs broken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these last defects are added to the four mentioned in the narrations, the types of animals that cannot be slaughtered become ten in total. There are these six types plus the animals that suffer from the four previously mentioned defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Condition:</strong> The sacrificial offering must be owned by the one slaughtering it or if not, he must have the right to slaughter it based on religious grounds or based on the approval of the animal’s owner. So if someone sacrifices an animal that does not belong to him, such as one that has been confiscated, stolen, or taken under false pretenses, such a sacrifice is not valid. This is since it is not permissible to draw near to Allaah by way of disobeying Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also valid if an orphan’s guardian sacrifices an animal for him using his (i.e. the orphan’s) money if this is what the orphan is accustomed to and if his heart will be broken if one is not sacrificed.[4] It is also permissible for a representative to perform the sacrifice using the funds of the person commissioning him with his permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Condition:</strong> No other person’s right should be associated to the animal being slaughtered. So for example, it is not valid to sacrifice an animal that is being held as mortgage on a loan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Condition:</strong> The animal should be slaughtered in the specific time-frame legislated in the Religion, which is from the time after the ‘Eid Prayer on the Day of Sacrifice[5] until the sun sets on the last of the days of Tashreeq, which is the thirteenth day of Dhul-Hijjah. So therefore, the days in which the sacrifice is permitted are four: the day of ‘Eid, after prayer, and the three days after that (i.e. the days of Tashreeq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever performs the sacrifice before the end of the ‘Eid Prayer or after the sun sets on the thirteenth day (of Dhul-Hijjah), his sacrificial offering is not valid. This is based on what Imaam Al-Bukhaaree reported from Al-Baraa’ bin ‘Aazib who narrated that the Prophet said: <strong>“Whoever sacrifice an animal before the (‘Eid) Prayer), it is just meat that he presents to his family and not a sacrificial offering at all.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree also reported that Jundub bin Sufyaan Al-Bajlee narrated: “I witnessed the Prophet say: <strong>‘Whoever slaughters an animal before praying (the ‘Eid Prayer) should slaughter another animal (as sacrifice) in its place.’</strong>” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nubaishah Al-Hadhlee narrated that Allaah’s Messenger said: <strong>“The days of Tashreeq are days of eating, drinking and remembrance of Allaah.”</strong> [Reported by Muslim] [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if one has a valid excuse for delaying the slaughter past the days of Tashreeq, such as if the animal runs away from him, due to negligence on his part, and he only finds it after the time-frame for slaughtering has passed. Another example is if a person entrusts someone to slaughter the animal for him but that person forgets to do it until the time has passed. In situations such as these, there is no sin in slaughtering after the prescribed time-frame since there is a valid reason for the delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also based on the analogy of it being similar to a person who sleeps passed the time of prayer or forgets to do it until its time passes, for he may pray it either when he wakes up or when he remembers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is allowed to perform the sacrifice any time during the days of Tashreeq, whether day or night. However, slaughtering during the daytime is better, and doing it on the day of ‘Eid after the two khutbahs is better than that. Each day is better than the day that comes after it, in terms of performing the sacrifice, since that reflects one’s quickness and eagerness to carry out good deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> Perhaps the orphan is accustomed to the sacrifice because this was his experience with his parents before he lost them. So if this tradition that he used to partake in with his family is not kept, it will cause his heart to be broken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> The Day of Sacrifice, i.e. Yawm-un-Nahr, is the day of ‘Eid, while the days of Tashreeq are the three days that follow it.</p>
