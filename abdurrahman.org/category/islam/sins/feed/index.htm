<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<p>Al-Haafidh ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee, may Allah have mercy upon him and provide us with his knowledge, said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The heart has been singled out for this because it is the leader of the body, and through the purification of the leader the subjects become purified, and with his corruption they become corrupted. So if you, O servant of Allah, with to cure your heart then it is upon you to be truthful with regards to seeking refuge with Allah and putting your trust in Him, to pray a great deal of superogatory prayers, to perform the actions of obedience to Allah frequently, to pray the night prayer while the people are sleeping, and to treat your heart by making it continuously stick to the remembrances and by befriending only the righteous … and to frequently recite the Qur’an. And Allah will indeed allow all of this to be preserved by him.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 80 : Points 140</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The lawful is that which you would witness and swear to be lawful, likewise the prohibited (<em>haraam</em>). That which causes uneasiness in your heart is something doubtful </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>[1] An-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;What is lawful is clear and what is unlawful is clear, but between them are certain doubtful things which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and his honour blameless. But he who falls into doubtful things falls into that which is unlawful, just as a shepherd who grazes his cattle in the vicinity of a pasture declared prohibited (by the king); he is likely to stray into the pasture. Mind you, every king has a protected pasture and Allah&#8217;s involved limits is that which He has declared unlawful. Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it is healthy, the whole body is healthy, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. Verily, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is a hidden trap that one must not feel secure from. Ash-Sha&#8217;bee <sup>[34]</sup> said: <strong>&#8220;It is called <em>Hawaa</em> because it throws down its&#8217; adherent.&#8221;</strong> In its general and unrestricted meaning, it demands ready pleasure without thinking about the outcome. It incites the immediate obtainment of lusts even though it is, sooner or later, the cause of greater sufferings. This life has an outcome before that of the Hereafter, and <em>Al-Hawaa</em> blinds its follower from giving notice to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man&#8217;s <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, <sup>[35]</sup> religion, and rationalism all forbid the pleasure whose outcome will be painful and prohibit lust whose legacy is sorrow and regret, each telling the self when it desires [pleasure and lust], &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it!&#8221; The self would obey the winner.<sup>[36]</sup> Don&#8217;t you see because of the weakness of the rationalistic restraint in a child, he prefers what he desires even though it may lead to his own destruction. On the other hand, the one who does not abide by the <em>Deen</em> prefers and likes what he desires even if it would lead to his destruction in the Hereafter because of the weakness in compliance to the Deen&#8217;s prohibitive code. The one who does not respect his <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em> prefers what he likes even if he injures [or shatters] or even loses his <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em> because of the weakness in adhering to its prohibitive code. What place does this hold in comparison with the saying of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee <sup>[37]</sup>: &#8220;<strong>If I knew that cold water would injure my <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, I would not drink it</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since man has been distinguished from other forms of creation by being subjected to the trials of Al-Hawaa, and because at all times he encounters all kinds of events and occurrences, two references of judgment have been established in order to deal with him: The <em>Deen</em> and reasoning. He is always commanded to refer all of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> related incidents to these judges [Deen and reasoning] and to submit to their ruling. He should train himself to ward off <em>Al-Hawaa</em> whose consequences are safe in order to train himself to abandon Al-Hawaa, which have harmful consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let the reasonable person know that lust addicts reach a state in which they do not find pleasure therein. Yet, they are unable to give it up, because it becomes to them like an indispensable form of living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why you see the alcoholic and <em>Al-Jimaa&#8217;</em> [38] addict does not reach one tenth of the enjoyment achieved by those who sometimes infrequently drink [39] or engage in <em>Al-Jimaa</em>&#8216;. However, it is the habit which requires that of him. Consequently, he drives himself into destructive paths to attain what is demanded by the habit. Had he been relieved from the <em>Rayn</em> [40] of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>, he would have known that he was miserable wherefore he anticipated happiness, depressed wherefore he thought he was glad, and in pain where from he sought pleasure. He is like a bird that was deceived by a grain of wheat, neither he was able to get it, nor he was able to free himself from the trap he got caught in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if it is asked: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;How could a person who fell in <em>Al-Hawaa</em> free himself from it?</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response is: &#8220;By the help and success granted by Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى), he will be able to liberate himself from <em>Al-Hawaa</em> by holding to the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A determined free will: having a vigilant care and sense of honor for himself, jealously protecting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A dose of patience making himself endure the bitter taste of the moment (i.e. the time his <em>Hawaa</em> is active).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Strength and self-determination that encourages him to drink that dose [of patience]. His courage is a moment of forbearance, and the best of living attained by an &#8216;<em>Abd</em> is through his perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Being aware of the splendid impression of the outcome and the cure achieved by that dose [of perseverance].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Being aware of the pain that exceeds the pleasure arising from following his <em>Hawaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Keeping his good standing before Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and in the hearts of Allaah&#8217;s &#8216;<em>Ibaad</em>. Certainly this is better and more beneficial to this than taking pleasure in following his <em>Hawaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Preferring the joy of &#8216;<em>Iffaah</em> [41] and its honor and sweetness over the pleasure of disobedience and wrong-doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Having delight in overcoming his enemy and driving him away disgraced in his rage, grief, and worry, being unable to get hold of him as he wishes. In fact, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) loves for His &#8216;<em>Abd</em> to abandon and enrage his enemy as He has said in his noble Book:</p>
<p><strong> وَلَا يَطَئُونَ مَوْطِئًا يَغِيظُ الْكُفَّارَ وَلَا يَنَالُونَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ نَّيْلًا إِلَّا كُتِبَ لَهُم بِهِ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan,SooratAt-Tawbah. 9:120].</p>
<p><strong> لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّار</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That He may enrage the disbelievers with them</strong> (i.e. the Sahaabah)<strong>.</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Falh, 48:29].</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا وَسَعَةً</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He who emigrates </strong>[from his home]<strong> in the Cause of Allaah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Nisaa&#8217;. 4:100],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means, &#8220;A place where he abandons and assails the enemies of Allaah.&#8221; The sign of true love is to enrage the enemies of the Beloved and to forsake them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Contemplating the fact that he has not been created to [be a slave of] Al-Hawaa, but that he has been prepared for a great task that will not be achieved unless he disobeys his Hawaa, as it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed they have prepared you for a task such that if you are aware of it (i.e. its importance and great outcome);</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Then you would hold yourself above giving respect to the negligent.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. That he should not choose for himself a state such that the unintelligible animal is better than him. Indeed the animal is able by means of his natural instincts to distinguish between beneficial and harmful situations, preferring the beneficial above the harmful. For the same purpose, man has been endowed with the faculty of reason. If he does not differentiate between what hurts or benefits him, or, in the case he realizes this but prefers what is harmful to him, then the status of an unintelligible animal is better than his. The evidence for this lies in the fact that an animal takes a share of enjoyment in the taste of food, drinks, and sexual relations that is not attainable by man, and that it lives a comfortable life free from thought and worry. Hence it is driven to its slaughtering place preoccupied with its lusts [42] due to the lack of knowledge about the consequences. Man will not procure the same damage done to the animal because of the intensity of the preoccupying thought, and the weakness of the used male organ, and so forth. Had the attainment of what is desired been a virtue, the right of man, who is the pure extract of the world, to it would have not been diminished while making it abundant to the animals. In the augmentation of man&#8217;s share of reasoning, knowledge, and cognition is a substitute for that (i.e. animalistic lust).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Let him lead his heart through the consequences of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and contemplate:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many virtues were missed because of his disobedience? And how much Ratheelah (vices) did it make him commit?</li>
<li>How many meals became inaccessible because of few meals?</li>
<li>How often a pleasure caused the loss of many?</li>
<li>How often did a desire break a rank, lower a head, [43] render a good reputation bad, inherit blame, leave behind it humiliation and dishonor that water cannot wash away. Yet, the eye of the follower of Hawaa is blind!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The intelligent person should imagine the attainment of his desire, his condition after his wish was fulfilled, what did he miss, and what occurred to him?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;The most excellent of people is the one who does not embark upon a means to accomplish something </strong>[44]<br />
<strong> Until he distinguishes (the evil,harms) that may be incurred by its consequences.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The intelligent person should really imagine what would the situation of another person be after he fulfills his desire then think of himself as being in the same standing. Indeed, the judgment respect of a thing is the same as respecting the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. He should give a thought as to what his self really demands from him regarding the thing he desires. He should then question his <em>Deen</em> and rationale about it, they will inform him that it is nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;oud [45] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>If anyone of you admires a woman, let him remember Manatinaha&#8230;</strong>&#8221; [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. He should keep himself far from the humiliation of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> because whenever someone obeys his <em>Hawaa</em> he will sense disgrace within himself. He should not be deceived by the force, assault, and pride of the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>, for they have the most lowly internal character of men; they have mustered both arrogance and humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. He should compare the safety of Deen, honor, and property, and rank to the attainment of the desired pleasure. He will not find any suitability whatsoever between them. Thus he should be aware that he is from the most ignorant of men if he would trade this (Deen, honor, property, rank, etc..) for that (i.e. <em>Hawaa</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. He should keep himself far from being under the subdual of his enemy, the Shaytaan, who, if he sees the &#8216;<em>Abd</em> in a state of weak determination and motivation and having an inclination towards his <em>Hawaa</em>, he would eagerly hope to overcome and possess him and control him with the bridle of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> leading him wherever he wants. And whenever he senses in him a strong determination, self-honor, and high motivation, he would not hope to get hold of him except secretly and by the way of deceit or circumvention. [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. He should realize that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> does not associate with any affair except that it corrupts it. If it gets to the knowledge, it causes him to go to Bid&#8217;ah and <em>Dhalaalah</em> [48] and its follower will become from amongst <em>Ahlul Ahwaa&#8217;</em> [49] If it affects <em>Al-Zuhd</em> [50], it will lead its adherent to Ar-Riyaa&#8217; [51] and to stand in opposition to As-Sunnah.[52] If it gets in a legal judgment, it leads its follower to injustice and hinders him from the truth. If it gets to the division of <em>Al-Qismah</em>,[53] it changes from a just into an unjust division. If it gets to the decisions of <em>Wilaayah</em> [54] and &#8216;<em>Azl</em> [55] it leads its adherent to commit treason against Allaah  (سبحانه و تعالى) and against the Muslims whereby he puts in charge or removes from duty according to his <em>Hawaa</em>. If it enters into worship it will deviate him from obedience and means of closeness [to Allaah]. Thus it associates not with anything but renders it corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. He should realize that there is no way for the Shaytaan to come in upon the son of Adam except from the gate of his Hawaa. He goes around him trying to find how to invade him so that he renders his heart and deeds corrupt. The only means of entrance he finds is that of Al-Hawaa, and so he creeps along with it like poison creeping in the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has made <em>Al-Hawaa</em> an opposite to what He has revealed to His Messenger. He has made its following directly opposite to the following of His Messengers, and He classified mankind into two groups: The followers of Revelation and the followers of Al-Hawaa, And this is found in many places in the Qur&#8217;aan, as in His saying:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا لَكَ فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they answer you not </strong>(i.e. do not follow the doctrine of Tawheed, nor follow you)<strong>, then know that they only follow Ahwaa&#8217;ahum</strong> (i.e. their evil inclinations: lust, desire, etc.)</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat AI-Qasas, 28:50].</p>
<p><strong>وَلَن تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you</strong> [O Muhammad]<strong> were to follow their </strong>[Jews and Christians] <strong>desires after what you have received of Knowledge</strong> (i.e. Qur&#8217;aan),<strong> then you would find neither a Waliy </strong>[protector or guardian]<strong> nor any helper against Allaah.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Ai-Baqarah. 2-120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other Aayaat of similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) likened the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> to the most contemptible animals in form and in concept. Sometimes He compared them to a dog, as in His saying:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَٰكِنَّهُ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ ۚ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ الْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his description is the description of a dog: If you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you leave him alone, he [still] lolls his tongue out.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-&#8216;Araaf, 7:176].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes He compared them to wild donkeys:</p>
<p><strong>كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُّسْتَنفِرَةٌ</strong><br />
<strong>فَرَّتْ مِن قَسْوَرَةٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As if they were frightened [wild] donkeys. Fleeing from a hunter, or a lion, Or a beast Of prey.</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat At-Muddaththir, 74:50-51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes He changed their forms into that of monkeys and pigs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. The one who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> neither deserves to be obeyed, nor to be an Imaam or to be followed, because Allaah removed him away from Imaamah (leading as an Imaam) and forbade obedience to him. As to his removal, it is because Allaah said to His Khaleel [56] Ibraaheem:</p>
<p><strong>إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا ۖ قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي ۖ قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, I am going to make you a leader </strong>[Prophet]<strong> of mankind.&#8221; </strong>[Ibraaheem] <strong>said: &#8220;And of my offspring</strong> [to make leaders]<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Allaah] <strong>said: &#8220;My Covenant includes not Ath-Thaalimeen </strong>(polythe&#8217;ists and wrong-doers)<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:124).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means that &#8220;My Covenant regarding Imaamah (Prophethood, leadership, etc.) does not include a Thaalim (polytheist and wrongdoer}.&#8221; Anyone who follows his Hawaa is a Thaalim as Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>بَلِ اتَّبَعَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَهْوَاءَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own Ahwaa&#8217;ahum Without knowledge.</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Ar-Room, 30:29].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prohibition to obey the follower of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> because of Allaah&#8217;s (سبحانه و تعالى) saying:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our Remembrance, one who followed his Hawaa and whose affair </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[deeds]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has been lost.</span> </strong>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Kahf, 18:28],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Allaah has made the one who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> at the same rank as that of the image-worshipper. He said in two places of His Book:</p>
<p><strong>أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Have you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[O Muhammad]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> seen him who has taken as his Ilaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[god]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> his own Hawaa?</span> </strong>[57] {Qur&#8217;aan,Soorat Al-Furqaan, 25:43].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan [58] commented: &#8220;He is the hypocrite; there is nothing that he desires except that he follows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8220;The hypocrite is a slave of his Hawaa: there is nothing that he desires except that he commits it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Verily, <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is the <em>Hithaar</em> [59] of Hell-Fire which surrounds it, he who walks across it will fall in Hell, just as the Prophet  (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in the hadeeth reported in As-Saheehain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Al-Jannah is surrounded by all kinds of disliked and undesirable things, while the Fire (Hell) is surrounded by all kinds of desires and passions.&#8221;</strong> [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the &#8220;Sunan&#8221; of At-Tirmithee in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah which he attributed to the Prophet  (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) [he said]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) created Al-Jannah and An-Naar [the (Hell) Fire], He send Jibreel to Al-Jannah and said: <strong>Go and look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its people.</strong> He went and looked at it and at what Allaah has prepared therein for its people, then came to Him and said: By Your Might, no one who hears of it will fail to enter it. He gave an order respecting it, and accordingly it was surrounded with undesirable things, and said [to Jibreel]: <strong>Go and look at it and at [the things] which I have prepared therein for its people</strong>. He went and looked at it, and found that it was surrounded with disliked and undesirable things, then came to Him and said: By Your Might, I am afraid that no one will enter it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, [Allaah] then said: <strong>Go to An-Naar and look at it and at [the things] which I have prepared therein for its people</strong>. [He went] and found that it was heaped up, one part upon another, then he came to Him and said: By Your Might, no one who hears of it will enter it. He gave a command respecting it, and it was surrounded with desirable things and passions and then said: <strong>Go back to it</strong>. He went and said: By Your Might, I am afraid that no one will remain who does not enter it.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It is feared that he who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> may become altogether detached from <em>Eemaan</em> (Faith) while being unaware. In fact, it has been confirmed that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>None of you is a true believer until his Hawaa is in accordance with what I have brought forth</strong>. &#8221; [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The most dreadful thing I fear in regard to you is the seductive lusts in your bellies and in your private parts, and the misleading ways of Al-Hawaa</strong>&#8221; [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is from the destructive sins. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three [things} lead to safety and three cause destruction. Those that lead to safety are: fearing Allaah in secrecy and in the open, uttering the truth at times of satisfaction and anger, and moderation at times of poverty and wealth. As to the [three] that cause destruction, they are: the Hawaa being followed, niggardliness being obeyed, and conceitedness.&#8221; [64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The opposing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> inherits strength in the heart, tongue and body of [Allaah&#8217;s] &#8216;Abd. Some of As-Salaf (righteous predecessors) said: &#8220;The one who overcomes his Hawaa is like him who conquers a city by himself.&#8221; And in the authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself-while in anger.&#8221;</strong> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever he trains himself on opposing his Hawaa, he would gain additional strength to his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. The most enriched in Al-Muroo&#8217;ah of the people is him who has the strongest opposition to his Hawaa. Mu&#8217;aawiyah [66] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em>Al-Muroo&#8217;ah</em> is the abandonment of desires and passions, and the disobedience of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> weakens the <em>Al-Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, and its opposition strengthen it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. There isn&#8217;t a day that passes except that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and the mind fight within its follower. Whoever of them overpowers its master, it will expel the other and take full control; and the decision will be its. Abu Ad-Dardaa&#8217; [67] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When a man wakes up, both his Hawaa and deeds meet; if his deeds are in accordance with his Hawaa, then his day is an evil one; and if his Hawaa is pursuant to his deeds, then his day is a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has made the wrong and the following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> .associates of each other, and has made the right and the opposition of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> as associates. As some of As-Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If two affairs were dubious to you and you don&#8217;t know which one is right, then oppose the one close to your Hawaa for it is more likely that error is committed when <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is being pursued.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is a disease and its remedy is in opposing it. Some learned men said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you wish, I will inform you of your illness, and if you wish I will tell you of your remedy: Your disease is your Hawaa, and your treatment is to abandon and oppose it.&#8221; Bishr Al-Haafee, [68]  &#8220;All kinds of affliction are manifested in your Hawaa, and the complete healing is in your opposition of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. The Jihaad against Al-Hawaa, if it is not more important than the Jihaad against the Kuffaar, certainly it is not less in importance. A man told Al-Hasan Al Basree &#8220;O Abaa Sa&#8217;eed! What kind of Jihaad is the best? He said: &#8220;It is the Jihaad of your Hawaa&#8221; I heard my Shaykh [69] saying: &#8220;The Jihaad against one&#8217;s self and against Al-Hawaa constitutes the basis for the Jihaad against the Kuffaar and the Munaafiqeen (hypocrites), because one is unable to make Jihaad against them until he makes Jihaad against himself and his Hawaa first, so that he can go out to [confront] them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is Takhleel (disorder and confusion of the intellect) and opposing it is Himiyyah [70] It is feared for the one who became excessive in Takhleet and retired himself from Al-Himiyyah, that his disease [mental sickness] may cause him to fall in a state of Sara&#8217;.[71] &#8216;Abdul Malik Ibn Quraib [72] said: &#8220;I passed by a bedouin who was suffering from an intensive inflammation in his eyes and his tears were shedding on his cheeks. I said: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wipe off your eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;The doctor prevented me from doing this, and there is no good in him who if urged to refrain [from doing something wrong] does not abstain, and if he is being commanded [to do something good] does not comply.&#8221; I said then: &#8220;Would you like something?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes! But I am in a state of Hitniyyah; the lusts of the people of [Hell] Fire overcame their Himiyyah, and thus they were destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. The pursuing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> renders the doors of success closed for the &#8216;Abd, and opens for him the doors of failure. So you see him often repeating the [following statement]: &#8220;Had Allaah bestowed His success, then it [the affair] would have been as such and such,&#8221; while in fact he barred himself from the ways of success by pursuing his Hawaa. Al-Fudayyl Bin &#8216;lyaad [73] said; &#8220;Whoever has been overtaken by his Hawaa and by the following of lusts, the sources of success will be severed from him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the scholars said: &#8220;Al-Kufr [74] originates from four things: anger, lust, hope, and fear.&#8221; He then added, &#8220;I have seen two of them manifested: a man who got angry and then killed his mother, and another who fell in love and became a Christian&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. The one who stands by his Hawaa, his intelligence and mental perception will become corrupt because he acted unfaithfully towards Allaah in his mind and, consequently, Allaah perverted it for him. This is the way He deals with anyone who betrays Him in any affair: He renders it in a bad state for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The one who broadens for his self the scope of pursuing Al-Hawaa, will put it under restriction in his grave and on the Day of his Return, The one who restrains it by opposing Al-Hawaa, brings ease upon it in his grave and on the Day of his Return. Allaah pointed to this in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their recompense shall be Al-Jannah and silken garments, because they were patient.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan: Soorat Al-lnsaan, 76:12],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since patience, which is holding oneself from pursuing Al-Hawaa, includes harshness and restrictions, accordingly Allaah will recompense them with the smoothness of silk and the wideness of Al-Jannah, Abu Sulaimaan Ad Daaraanee [75] commented on the above Aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah shall recompense them for taking patience against lusts.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> throws down the &#8216;Abd preventing him to stand up and walk with those saved on the Day of Resurrection, just like when his heart fell [in a state of Sara&#8217;] in this life which kept him from their company. Muhammad Bin Abee Al-Ward said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is one of Allaah&#8217;s days when no one who pursues his Hawaa shall be saved of its evil. The slowest in his ability to stand up amongst those thrown down on the Day of the Resurrection is the one whose thrown in a state of Sara&#8217; by his lusts&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. The pursuing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> breaks up and weakens one&#8217;s resolution, and opposing [Al-Hawaa] solidifies and strengthens it. Resolution is the thing upon which one rides upon in his journey to Allaah and the Last Day. If that which is ridden became inactive, the traveler would almost be disabled to proceed in his journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa Bin Mu&#8217;aath [77] was asked: &#8220;Who is most sound in resolution of men?&#8221; He answered: &#8220;The one who overcomes his Hawaa&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. The parable of the one who follows his own whim is like that who rides on a tough, strong-tempered, Jamooh [78] horse without a bridle, about to be thrown down by his horse during its run or it would lead him to his death. A learned man said: &#8220;The most rapid means to ride onto Al-Jannnah is the Zuhd respecting this life, and the most rapid means to get on to An-Naar is the love of lusts. And him who boards his Hawaa, it will hastily take him to the valley of perdition.&#8221; Another said: &#8220;The most endowed with honor of the scholars is the one who flees with his <em>Deen</em> from this Dunya [79] and who is hard to be led to follow Al-Hawaa.&#8221; &#8216;Ataa&#8217; [80] said: &#8220;The one whose Hawaa overtakes his rationale causing him to become affected with grief and agitation because of lacking the strength to be patient, would be put to shame.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. The Tawheed and the following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> are two contrary matters: because <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is an idol, and each &#8216;Abd has an idol in his heart, the magnitude of which depends upon his Hawaa; Rather, Allaah sent His Messengers to destroy the idols and to call for His worship Alone, having no partners or associates. Nay, Allaah&#8217;s intent is not just to demolish the corporeal images and leave the images imbedded in the heart, but rather to destroy those in the heart first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Bin &#8216;AH Al-Muttawwi&#8217;ee [81] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The idol of each person is his Hawaa, he who breaks it by the way of opposition deserves the title of honourableness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just contemplate about the saying of AlKhaleel (Ibraaheem to his people [as Allaah said]:</p>
<p><strong>مَا هَٰذِهِ التَّمَاثِيلُ الَّتِي أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">What Are these images, to which you are devoted?</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;aan,Soorat Al-Anbiyaa&#8217;, 21:52],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and you will certainly find it identical to those images which the heart likes and devotes itself to and worships it besides Allaah. He, Allaah, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلًا</strong><br />
<strong>أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ ۚ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ ۖ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have you </strong>[O Muhammad] <strong>seen him who has taken his illaah </strong>(god)<strong> as his own desire? Would you be then a Wakeel </strong>[a protecting guide]<strong> over him? Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle. Nay, they are even farther astray from the Path </strong>[i.e. even worst than Cattle]</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Furqaan, 25:43-44].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is the means to drive away diseases from the heart and from the body, and its following brings forth diseases to the heart and to the body. Heart diseases are all from following of Al-Hawaa. If you search for the causes behind diseases of the body, you will find that most of it are because of preferring <em>Al-Hawaa</em> over what should be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The origin for the enmity, evil, and envy that occurs between people is from the following of Al-Hawaa. The one who opposes his Hawaa relieves his heart, body, and limbs, putting himself to ease and thus relieves others. Abu Bakr Al-Warraaq [83] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the Hawaa prevails, the heart turns dark and when it does so, the breast becomes straitened and when that happens, the moral character deteriorates and consequently people will hate him and he will hate them. Then think of the evil, enmity, neglect of rights, etc. that arise from this mutual hatred!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Allaah has created in man an intellect and a Hawaa; whichever of the two becomes manifest, the other will hide, as Abu &#8216;Ali Ath- Thaqafee said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is overcome by his Hawaa, his intellect will be hidden from him. So, look at the end of him whose intellect is masked from him and became overpowered by something else.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali Bin Sahl [84] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The intellect and <em>Al-Hawaa</em> are in conflict. Success is the associate of the intellect and defeat is the associate of Al-Hawaa. The self stands between both; whichever of the two prevails, the self will side with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. Allaah has made the heart the king of the limbs and the place of the origination of knowledge, love, and &#8216;Uboodiyyah of Him. He tested him with two kinds of authority, two armies, two aids, and two sets of preparations. The truth, Zuhd, and guidance is one authority. Its aids are the angels, and its army is truthfulness and sincerity, and its preparation is in avoiding Al-Hawaa. The other authority is falsehood. Its aids are the Shayaateen and its troops and the preparation is the following of Al-Hawaa. The self stands between the two armies. The army of falsehood will have access to the heart only from its direction and frontier breaches, for it pervades the heart and aligns itself with its enemy against it (the heart) and thus the calamity will overtake it. It is the self, therefore, that offers its enemy from its own preparations, and opens for him the gate of the city and thus he enters and takes full control, and the heart takes the defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. The worst of enemies to man is his Shaytaan and his Hawaa, and the best friend he has is his intellect and his associate angel who gives him advice. If he follows his Hawaa, he gives his hand in surrender to his enemy, submitting himself as a captive to him, making him [the enemy] rejoice at his affliction, and causing displeasure to his friends and supporters. These are precisely the difficult moments of a calamity, wretchedness, the manifested divine decree of an evil ending, and the malicious joy of enemies. [86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. Each &#8216;Abd has a beginning and an end. He whose start is the following of AlHawaa, shall end up in a state of disgrace, humiliation, bereavement, and trials. What is being followed commensurate with the [&#8216;Abd&#8217;s] degree of dependency upon his Hawaa. Rather, at the end, the followed turns to a suffering that agonizes him in his heart as one poet put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Desires that were, at the age of youthfulness, sweet to those who wished</strong><br />
<strong> then, became a suffering at Al-Masheeb (an old age)&#8221;</strong> [87]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate about the case of everyone who is in a bad and miserable state, you would find that it began with him embracing his Hawaa and giving it preference over his intellect. Anyone who begins by opposing his Hawaa and obeying the call of his Rushd,[88] his end will be that of honor, might, richness, and high rank before Allaah and before the people. Abu &#8216;Ali Ad-Daqqaaq89 said: &#8220;The one who controls his lust in his youthfulness, Allaah will honor him when he is in his age of maturity.&#8221; AlMuhallab Bin Abee Sufrah90 was asked: &#8220;How did you attain this status of yours? He said: &#8220;Through firm obedience and rebellion against Al-Hawaa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the situations regarding the stand against <em>Al-Hawaa</em> in the beginning and in the end of one&#8217;s life in this world. With respect to the Hereafter, however, Allaah has made Al-Jannah the end for him who opposed his Hawaa and An-Naar the end for the one who followed his Hawaa [91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is slavery to the heart, an iron chain round the neck, and a fetter to the leg. Its follower is a captive to everyone with a bad character. Thus whoever opposes it, liberates himself from slavery and becomes free, and takes off the chain round his neck and becomes in a state similar to that of a man belonging entirely to one master after belonging to many partners disputing one another.[92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> puts the &#8216;Abd in the rank of the one whose oath Allaah fulfills. The goals that He will accomplish for him will be many-fold that which he was unable to attain as a result of neglecting his Hawaa. He is like the one who relinquished a Ba&#8217;arah and was given a pearl as a compensation for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever he is able to gain from the way of following <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is incomparable with what he looses from present and future benefits and from good living. So try to comprehend the stretching forth of the hand of Yoosuf, theSiddeeq95 in expenditure, the unconstriction with his tongue, the establishment of his feet [in power], and the rejoice that touched him after he came out of the jail because he restrained himself from the Haraam [unlawful].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> entitles the honor in this world and in the Hereafter and self-esteem, outwardly and inwardly. Following it, however, lowers the rank of the &#8216;Abd in this life and in the Hereafter and humiliates him, outwardly and inwardly. When Allaah gathers mankind on one plane [on the Day of Resurrection], an announcer will call, &#8220;This day the people of generosity will be distinguished from those who amassed wealth. Now let the pious stand.&#8221; [97] They will stand and walk toward the place of honor while the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> bending their heads down before Allaah] in the Mawqif [98] amidst the &#8220;heat of AI-Hawaa&#8221; its sweat and its suffering. The others [the pious] will be in the shade of the &#8216;Arsh. [99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. If you contemplate about the seven whom Allaah will shade in the shade of His &#8216;Arsh wherein there is no shade but His,[100] you will find that they deserved that shade because of their opposition to Al-Hawaa. Indeed the Imaam having authority and power will not be able to establish justice except by opposing his Hawaa. And with respect to the youth who prefers the sincere worship of Allaah over the urge of his youthfulness, had it not been for the opposition of his Hawaa, he would not be able to accomplish this state of worship. As to the person whose heart is attached to the mosques, the thing that drove him to this condition is the opposition of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> which invites him to the places of lusts. Concerning the person who gives charitable gifts secretly so that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given, had it not been for his subduing of his Hawaa, he would have not been able to attain this state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who was invited by a charming woman of noble birth [to have illegal sexual intercourse with her], feared Allaah and opposed his Hawaa. As to the one who remembers Allaah in seclusion and his eyes becomes flooded with tears for fearing Him, the thing that made him reach this state is the opposing of his Hawaa. Consequently, they were saved from being affected by the intense heat of the Al-Mawqif on the Day of Resurrection and the sweating therein. The people [adhering to] <em>Al-Hawaa</em> will experience the utmost degree of intense heat and sweating while they are still waiting to enter the &#8220;Prison of Al-Hawaa&#8221; Allaah is the One to be petitioned to grant us protection from the Ahwaa&#8217; (Sing. Hawaa) of ourselves which are inclined to evil, and that He makes our Hawaa in accordance with what He loves and is acceptable to Him. He has power over all things, and He is most worthy of answering our petition.</p>

He also studied in &#8216;Iraaq under Imaam Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan, the famous student of Imaam Abu Haneefah. Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee holds the distinction of being the first Imaam to systematize the principles of Islaamic Law or Fiqh (Jurisprudence).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38]<em> Al-Jimaa</em>&#8216;: Legal sexual intercourse between a man and his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Islaam prohibits all forms of intoxication. The evil associated with alcoholic drinks is much greater than the little enjoyment that may be felt by few drinks. In fact the few drinks demand more of it until the person feels high. Then the demand grows to reach a state higher than with his first one. Addiction slowly creeps to destroy the drinker&#8217;s life and in many cases his family. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you </strong>[O Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم]<strong> concerning alcoholic drink and gambling.

<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] And then regrets it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] <strong>&#8216;Abdullaah Bin Mas&#8217;oud</strong>, the honorable companion who accepted Islaam early when Faatimah (the daughter of &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab radiAllaahu anhu) and her husband became Muslims. He was the first to openly recite the Qur&#8217;aan in Makkah. The Mushrikeen harmed him for his recitation. He prayed to the first Qiblah (Al-Quds, Jerusalem) and to the second and last Qiblah (Makkah). He migrated twice, once to Abyssinia (the first migration) and the second to Al-Madeenah. He attended the battle of Badr, Uhud and all the other confrontations with the Mushrikeen. The Khaleefah &#8216;Umar Ibn AI-Khattaab assigned him to teach Islaam to the people of Al-Khoofah in &#8216;Iraaq. Later &#8216;Uthmaan (radiAllaahu anhu) called him to Al-Madeenah where he died in the year 32/654. He was known for his great knowledge in Qur&#8217;aan and its Tafseer. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) attested to &#8216;Abdullaah&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] That is when he is inclined by his desire and lust to indulge in an unlawful act with her, let him remember something that may turn off his desire, like manatinaha: all forms of her menses and the odor associated with that. [I asked Shaykh Muhammad Bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen about this explanation of Ibn Mas&#8217;oud&#8217;s saying and, alhamdulilaah, he affirmed it.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Especially at times of unawareness. &#8216;Abdullaah Bin Mas&#8217;oud said: &#8220;You are at a time when the truth leads <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and there shall come a time when <em>Al-Hawaa</em> will lead the truth. So, we seek refuge in Allaah from that time to come.&#8221; [See Al-Jaami&#8217; li Ahkaam Al-Qur &#8216;aan by Al-Qurtubee (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah, 1413/1993), V. 19, p. 135.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] Deviation from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa&#8217;</em> (The People of Corrupt Desires): The people who follow concepts of belief and methodologies of understanding and practices deviating from the right path, or from the truth, thus following their [corrupt] desires. [Some of their qualities are presented in the Appendix],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em>Zuhd</em>: To lead a pious life devoted to Allaah taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc., nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. [See a discussion on this subject in the Appendix],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51]<em> Ar-Riyaa&#8217;</em>: Showing off, and not doing an action solely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] Mystic Sufism adopted ways of Zuhd that stand in direct opposition to the guidance of the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah. [See the Appendix under <em>Zuhd</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] <em>Al-Qismah</em>: Generally it refers to the division of property, shares, booties, profits, etc. In the Qur&#8217;aan it refers to the division of the deceased&#8217;s property in accordance with the laws of inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] <em>Wilaayah</em>: Appointing a person in charge of an office or an authority over a thing (town, district, country, province or the like).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] &#8216;<em>Azl</em>: Removal of someone from his office or exercise of authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56] <em>Khaleel</em>, i.e. Allaah&#8217;s Khaleel: The one whom Allaah has distinguished by love and honor. Ibraaheem Al-Khaleel is Prophet Ibraaheem whom, like Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) Allaah has distinguished by love and honor.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] <em>Hithaar</em>: Anything forming a barrier, an obstruction, a partition, or a fence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] An agreed upon hadeeth. [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #494.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] Reported by At-Tirmithee who said that it is &#8220;hasan-saheeh&#8221;.- It is also reported by An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Abu Daawood. Shaykh Al-Albaanee concluded that it is authentic in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217; #5210 and in Mishkaatul Masaabeeh #5696. The terminology &#8220;hasan-saheeh &#8221; used by At-Tirmithee refers to one of two situations regarding the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-That it is reported through one way of narration and there is a disagreement regarding the status of one narrator in the chain: Some consider him sound while others consider him &#8220;hasan,&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-It is reported via two chains of narration, one &#8220;Hasan&#8221; and the other &#8220;saheeh&#8221;. (See Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar&#8217;s An-Nukal &#8216;Alaa Nuzhatin-Nalhar fee Tawdeeh Nukhbatul-Fikar (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul-Jawzee, 1414/1994)], pp. 93-94.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;hasan&#8221; (fine) is itself authentic but does not reach the level of authenticity of the &#8220;saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] Shaykh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah protect him, said: The Isnaad (chain of narration) of this hadeeth is weak because of the status of weakness of Nu&#8217;aim Bin Hammaad (a narrator). See Shaykh Al-Albaanee&#8217;s comments on Al-Tabreezee&#8217;s Mishkaatul Masaabeeh [Beirut, Lebanon: AI-Maktab Al-Islaamee, 1405/1985], V. l,p. 59. Al-Haafith Ibn Rajab observed another cause of weakness of this hadeeth in his commentary on An-Nawawee&#8217;s authentication of the same hadeeth. [See Ibn Rajab&#8217;s Jaami&#8217; Al-&#8216;Uloom wal Hikam (Beirut, Lebanon; Muassasatur-Risaalah, checked by Shu&#8217;ayeb Al-Ama&#8217;out and Ibraaheem Baajis, 1412/1991], V. 2, p. 394.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] Reported by Imaam Ahmad, and Al-Haithamee said: &#8220;It was reported by Ahmad, Al-Bazzaar, and At-Tabaraanee in his  Ma&#8217;aajim: As-Sagheer, Al-Awsat. and Al-Kabeer, and its narrators are &#8216;men of Saheeh1 [i.e. generally classified in the category of sound, reliable, or even less. This does not necessarily mean that the rest of conditions required to authenticate the Isnaad (chain of narration), not to mention the hadeeth itself, are usually met.] [See Shaykh Al-Albaanee&#8217;s introduction to Saheeh At-Targheeb war Tarheeb by AlMunthiree, pp. 43-50.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Al-Muhaddith Shaykh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is hasan. See As~Silsi!ah As-Saheehah, #1802, and Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;, #3045.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] An agreed upon hadeeth, [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #135.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] <strong>Mu&#8217;aawiyah</strong> is the Sahaabee Sakhr Bin Harb Bin Umayyah Bin &#8216;Abd Shams Bin &#8216;Abd Manaaf Bin Qusay Bin Kilaab, Abu&#8217;Abdur Rahmaan. The Ameer of Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, and the King of Islaam. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allaah! Bestow upon him the knowledge of the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) and save him from torment.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in Fadaa &#8216;il As-Sahaabah, V. 2, p. 913.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The checker said its Isnaad is hasan because of other narrations]. He also invoked Allaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;O Allaah! Make of him (i.e. Mu&#8217;aawiyah) a guide (to the truth), cause him to be rightly directed, and cause others to be rightly directed by him.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad, V. 5 #17438, and by At-Tirmithee. Al-A!baanee said it is saheeh (see Saheeh Sunan At-Tirmithee, #3018).] He was one of the Sahaabah who recorded the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to many false reports, Mu&#8217;aawiyah did not seek to take over the Khilaafah from &#8216;Ali Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imaam Ath-Thahabee, AtTabaree, and many other scholars from the Salaf asserted that Mu&#8217;aawiyah used to acknowledge that &#8216;Ali is better than him and that he [Mu&#8217;aawiyah] does not deserve the Khilaafah. His position, however, was that he wanted &#8216;Ali to punish the assassins of &#8216;Uthmaan^ before he would give his loyalty to him. He thought that he was on the truth regarding this matter. &#8216;Ali on the other hand, conditioned that Mu&#8217;aawiyah must give the pledge of loyalty to him because he was the Khaalefah and that he thought it is wise to wait until he consolidates his power and then seek &#8216;Uthmaan&#8217;s assassins. &#8216;Ali had nothing to do with the killing of &#8216;Uthmaan Based upon many authentic narrations and prophecies from the Prophet Ahlus-Sunnah consider to be on the side of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fitnah was ignited by a group of dissidents known as As-Saba&#8217;iyyah whose leader, &#8216;Abdullah Bin Saba&#8217;, was a Jew who considered &#8216;Ali to be Allaah incarnate! Most of the Sahaabah kept themselves away from the fitnah and only a few, not exceeding thirty, shared in the fighting between the army of &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic rule at the time of Mu&#8217;aawiyah&#8217;s Kingdom was very strong whereby the Muslims ruled a vast area extending from Khurasaan in the East to the West African coast, and from Cyprus in the Mediterranean to the Yemen in the South. [See Tahqeeq Mawaaqif AsSahaabah Fee Al-Fitnah; Establishing the (True) Position of the Sahaabah During the Fitnah (i.e. Between &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;aawiyahby Dr. Muhammad Amakhzoon, V. 2, pp. 93-130, published by Daar Tayebah and Maktabat Al-Khawthar, Riyaadh, KSA, 1415/1994.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason why that I have highlighted some of these important facts is that most of what had been written about this fitnah is either a) fully historical and not authenticated, b) compiled by orientalists, or c) promoting baseless accounts by the Raafidhah (the rejectionists of the Shee &#8216;ah). The fully documented and authenticated reports from the Muhadditheen regarding the fitnah gave us the true positions of the Sahaabah regarding this matter. An excellent source is Al- &#8216;Awaasim Minal Qawaasim by Abu Bakr Bin &#8216;Al-Arabi AI-Maalikee (not the infamous mystic Sufi Ibn &#8216;Arabi) with commentary by Muhib-ed-Deen AI-Khateeb, 5th edition, Maktabat AsSunnah, Cairo, 1408.

He is known as the <em>Hakeem</em> (the wise man) of this Ummah. He was from the few amongst the Sahaabah who collected the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. He reported one hundred and ninety seven Ahaadeeth.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is considered a Sufi in the context of the early practice of sufism in which some of its followers were mostly interested in leading a pious life of Zuhd (an abstemious way of life), patience, clemency, sincerity, truthfulness, etc.. Overall they were close to the teachings of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, although some of them exaggerated and (or) introduced innovated forms of worship and concepts. [See Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, 10:366-367, and Ibnul Jawzee in Talbees Iblees, p. 156.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically the process started in Basra, &#8216;Iraaq by the time when the majority of <em>Taabi&#8217;ee</em> (the followers of) <em>At-Taabi&#8217;een</em> passed away (Ibid, 10:358). Many of them used to wear woollen (<em>suf</em>) clothing a sign of disassociation from the wordly life. The first to establish a &#8220;house for the sufiyyah&#8221; was a man by the name of &#8216;Abdul Waahid Bin Zayed (Ibid, 10:359). In their works there is a blend of truth and falsehood. The majority of the scholars, including Imaam Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ahmad, Maalik, and others from Ahl-ul-Hadeeth, criticized their ways especially their so-called <em>Samoa</em>&#8216; [singing aimed to stimulating a state of <em>Wajd</em> (ecstasy)] and excessive worship. Whatever opposes the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and the way of the Salafis to be rejected and whatever is in agreement is accepted because it is not innovated. The acceptance is not an approval of the terminology or the essence of Sufism in any of its stages. It remains to be remembered that it is not true that every pious and <em>Zaahid</em> Muslim is necessarily a Sufi. The <em>Zuhaad</em> (Sing. <em>Zaahid</em>) of the later times were more influenced by scholastic theology (<em>Ilm Al-Kalaam</em>) which began to creep into the Ummah following the translations of many of the philosophical concepts of the Hindus, Greeks, Romans, and Persians (Ibid, 10:367). Consequently, they deviated from the way of the Sahaabah and their followers from At-Taabi&#8217;een (Ibid, 10:358;366-367). It is known that <em>Zuhd</em> practices developed into organized forms of hunger, poverty, self-strive, seclusion, sleeplessness, wandering, handclapping, dancing, going to the markets in strange ways, abandoning the interest in hadeeth knowledge, and other extremes. Sufism further developed into a school of mysticism and corrupt creed and methodology. [See Talbees Iblees, pp. 156-165, published by Maktabat-ul Qur&#8217;aan, Cairo, Egypt.]</p>

[See Al-Muntakhab min Kitaab As-Siyaaq litaareekh Naisapoor, by Al-Haafith Taqyee-ed <em>Deen</em> As-Sayyzafeenee, p. 431, #1337. Published by Al-Maktabah At-Tijaariyyah, Makkah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you with whom is not an companion from amongst the jinn </strong>[devils]<strong>. They </strong>[the Sahaabah] <strong>said: &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, with you too?&#8221; Thereupon he said: &#8220;Yes, but Allaah helps me against him and as such he surrendered </strong>[to Allaah in Islaam]<strong> and commands me not except for good. &#8220;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim. See Saheeh Muslim, V. 4, Hadeeth #6757.] In another narration by Muslim and Ahmad, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you with whom there is not an companion from amongst the jinn </strong>[devils] <strong>and an attache from amongst the angels.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This companion from the angels may be different from those assigned by Allaah to write the record of deeds of the children of Adam. [See Al-Ashqar&#8217;s book &#8216;Aalam Al-Malaa&#8217;ikah AlAbraar (Kuwait, State of Kuwait: Maktabat Al-Falaah and Daar An-Nafaa&#8217;is, 1411/1991), p. 44.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] These are the moments of difficulty which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to seek refuge with Allaah from: Abu Huraira narrated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;he Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to seek refuge with Allaah from the difficult moments of calamity and from being overtaken by Ash-Shaqaa&#8217; (wretchedness in the Hereafter or destruction etc.) and from being destined to an evil end, and from the malicious joy of enemies.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan (Bin &#8216;Uyainah) said: &#8220;This narration contained three items only, but I added one. I do not know which one that was.&#8221;[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, and An-Nasaa&#8217;ee. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #358.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[87] <em>Al-Masheeb</em>: The period of whiteness of the hair, or hoariness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] <em>Rushd</em>: Maturity of intellect enabling the person lo follow a right course of action and providing a good management of affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] Abu &#8216;Ali Ad-Daqqaaq is Al-Hasan Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Muhammad Bin Ishaaq Bin &#8216;Abdur Raheem Bin Ahmad, a Zaahid Sufi who excelled in fiqh, Islaamic Fundamentals, and Arabic language. According to some reports, he died around 406/1016. See Al-&#8216;Ibar, V. 2, p. 212, and ShatharaatAth-Thahab,V.3,p. 180. Daar Ihyaa&#8217; At-Turaath Al-&#8216;Arabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] Al-Muhallab Bin Abee Sufrah is Thaalim Ibn Saariq Al-&#8216;Aatakee Al-Azdee, Abu Sa&#8217;eed AI-Basree, One of the trustworthy leaders and heroes who was knowledgeable about war plans and strategies. He reported Hadeeth transmissions from &#8216;Abdullaah Bin &#8216;Amr Bin Al-&#8216;Aas, Samrah Bin Jundhub, Ibn &#8216;Umar, Al-Baraa&#8217; Bin &#8216;Aazib, and others from the Sahaabah [See <em>Tahtheeb Siyar &#8216;AlaamAn-Nubalaa</em>&#8216;, V. 1, #532, and <em>Taqreeb At-Tahtheeb</em>, #6986.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَىٰ</strong><br />
<strong>وَآثَرَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا</strong><br />
<strong>فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> Then, for him who Taghaa </strong>[transgressed all bounds, in disbelief, oppression, and evil deeds of disobedience to Allaah]<strong>, and preferred the life of this world </strong>[by following his evil desires and lusts]<strong>, verily, his abode will be Hell-Fire.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Naazi&#8217;aal, 79:37-39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong><br />
<strong>فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But as for him who feared standing before his Rabb </strong>[Allaah]<strong>, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts, verily, Al-Jannah will be his abode.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Naazi &#8216;aat, 79:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَّجُلًا فِيهِ شُرَكَاءُ مُتَشَاكِسُونَ وَرَجُلًا سَلَمًا لِّرَجُلٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلًا ۚ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah puts forth a similitude: A </strong>[slave]<strong> man belonging to many partners </strong>[like those who worship others along with Allaah] <strong>disputing with one another, and a </strong>[slave]<strong> man belonging entirely to one master </strong>[like those who worship Allaah Alone],<strong> Are those two equal in comparison? All the praises and thanks are due to Allaah! But most of them know not.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:29)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[93] Ba&#8217;rah(Pl. Ba&#8217;r) A piece of animal dung. This signifies what is low.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[94] Signifying what is precious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[95] The man of truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] In his eloquent and clear speech with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[97] &#8220;This is from the Ghaybiyaat ( matters of Al-Ghayb) and it is not confirmed by an authentic evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] The standing before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection awaiting His Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] Know, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you, that the shade sometimes is mentioned in relation to Allaah and sometimes in relation to His &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>. Many authentic narrations reported by Imaam Ahmad, Ad-Daarimee, Al-Baghawee, At-Tirmithee, Al-Haakira, At-Tabaraanee and others state that the shade is that of the &#8216;Arsh. As Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar explained, these narrations when related to the context of the agreed upon hadeeth: &#8220;<strong>Allaah will give shade to seven, on the Day when there would be no shade but His&#8230;</strong>&#8221; preponderates that the shade is that of the &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen commented that the Prophet&#8217;s statement: &#8220;<strong>On the Day when there would be no shade but His&#8230;</strong>&#8221; means that there would be no shade except that which He creates and that the belief that the shade is that of Allaah&#8217;s Essence is false, because this would imply that the sun is above Allaah the Most Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Fathul Baaree</em> V. 2, p. 144, and <em>Sifaatullaah Al-Waaridah Fil Kitaabi-wasSunnah</em>, by &#8216;Alawee Bin &#8216;Abdul QaadirAs-Saqqaaf pp. 171-174, and <em>Sharhul &#8216;Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> by Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen, V. 2, p. 136.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] The seven were mentioned in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah will give shade to seven, on the Day when there will be no shade but His. [These seven persons are]:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(1) a just ruler,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(2) a youth who has been brought up in the worship of Allaah [i.e. worships Allaah sincerely from his childhood},</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosques [i.e. he offers the five compulsory <em>Salaat</em> (prayers) in the mosques],</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(4) two persons who love each other only for Allaah&#8217;s sake and they meet and part in Allaah&#8217;s Cause only.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(5) a man who refuses the call of a charming women of noble birth for illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(6) a man who gives charitable gifts so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given [i. e. nobody knows how much he has given in charity}, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(7) a person who remembers Allaah in seclusion and his eyes become flooded with tears, &#8220;</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 28 : Point 33</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And stoning is true.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370008986&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/stoning-the-adulterer-or-adulteress-is-true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has forbidden some things relating to matters affecting peoples&#8217; honour or relating to dealings and other than that.; and these forbidden matters are divided into categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Forbidden things which are major sins<br />
&#8211; Forbidden matters which are lesser sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then with regard to the punishment upon the one who commits them, they are divided into three categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first category:</strong></span> forbidden things for which Allaah has laid down prescribed punishments. They are called <span style="color:#003300;"><strong><em>al-hudood</em> prescribed punishments</strong></span> from the word <em>al-hadd</em> (limit); it means <strong>prevention</strong>. They are called that because they prevent from falling into these sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second category:</strong></span> forbidden things which Allaah has not laid down prescribed punishments for, however there is <span style="color:#003300;"><strong><em>ta`zeer</em> (discretionary) punishments</strong></span> for them; and it is left to the discretion of the ruler in accordance with whatever he sees will be a deterrent from them. And this is called <em>ta`zeer</em> and it is a <span style="color:#003300;"><strong>correctional</strong> </span>punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third category:</strong></span> that which does not have a laid down prescribed punishment nor does it have a discretionary punishment from those forbidden things. However, there does occur with regard to it <strong>a threat and a mention of anger and curse and Fire</strong> and other than that from the types of threat; such as consuming usury and gambling and other than that. With regard to this there is a severe threat which will deter whoever has eemaan (true faith) in his heart. And whoever does not have eemaan in his heart or he is weak in faith, then in front of him there will be a <strong>reckoning and a punishment in the Hereafter</strong>. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has made forbidden these forbidden matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah made obligatory duties obligatory, so do not neglect them. And He made some things forbidden, so do not commit them. And He remained silent about some things as a mercy upon you, not out of forgetfulness, so do not ask about them.</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from these prescribed punishments is the prescribed punishment for fornication. And fornication is to commit illicit sexual intercourse in the private part of one not lawful for him, except through correct legislated marriage contract.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who guard their private parts, except upon their wives or the slaves whom their right hands possess. For they are not blameworthy. And whoever seeks something beyond that, then they are the transgressors.</span></strong> (Sooratul- Ma`aarij (70), aayah 29 &#8211; 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning those who go beyond what is lawful and enter into that which is forbidden. So whoever enters into fornication, then he will be one of two categories. Either if he is a virgin, meaning he has not had relations with a woman in a lawful marriage which kept him chaste, he is a virgin, then his punishment will be that he will be lashed one hundred times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the female fornicator and the male fornicator, lash each one of them with a hundred lashes. And let not pity deter you from obedience to Allaah, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Noor (24), aayah 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the authentic Sunnah that he should be exiled, meaning banished from his land where he committed the illicit sexual relations and sent to another land for a the period of one year. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>For a virgin committing it with a virgin, then the punishment is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.</strong></span> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So exile is confirmed in the Sunnah. As for lashing then it is established in the Qur&#8217;aan. And the scholars are agreed in consensus upon lashing, and the majority of them also agree upon exile. This is with regard to the punishment for the virgin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong>previously married person</strong>, and he is the one who has had relations already with the wife in a correct marriage, and he recognizes the value of peoples honour and the sanctity of peoples honour. And this person, he is stoned with stones until he dies. And this is established in the Qur&#8217;aan whose wording was abrogated, but whose ruling remained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> said upon the mimbar of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The aayah of stoning came down and we comprehended it and we preserved it. And Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stoned. And I fear that if a time becomes prolonged for the people, that they will start to say, ‘We do not find stoning in the Book of Allaah’. Indeed it is in the Book of Allaah.</strong> </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was Qur&#8217;aan whose wording was abrogated, but whose ruling remained. And Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stoned and he commanded stoning. And the Muslims are agreed in consensus upon that. And no one disagreed about it, except for the people of innovations, those whose disagreement is not taken account of such as the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So stoning is established in the Book and in the Sunnah of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sayings (Sunnah qawliyyah) and his actions (Sunnah `amaliyyah) and by consensus. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So whoever denies it is a disbeliever, because he is denying that which Allaah has said and His Messenger and the consensus of the Muslims</span>. So stoning is established. There is no scope for speech about it. And therefore he stated it here and said “Stoning is true”. This is the creed and belief of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah in refutation of the innovators, those who deny stoning without knowledge and without clear insight, because of their ignorance and because of their childishness in regards to knowledge; and they are relying upon their intellects and their own thinking. And those people are not counted. No notice is taken of them and their sayings are not looked at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sometimes an ignorant person can come claiming awareness and to have researched and say, “There is disagreement about this.” So it is said to him, “Is it the case that every disagreement is taken account of?! There are matters of disagreement which are totally discarded and not counted. And from them is this disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the writer of the lines of poetry said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Not every disagreement that comes about is taken account of, except that which has of correct examination.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is not just claims of disagreement. The matter is one of verification of what is correct and tying it to the proof. So whoever goes against the proof, then he is defeated in the argument and there is no weight given to his disagreeing, and he is not counted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you disagree about anything, then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and the last day, that is the better and finer in its outcome.</span></strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we do not just remain upon there being disagreement, rather we refer back to the proof, because of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the last day, that is the better and finer regarding its outcome.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the author rahimahullaah he stated the issue of stoning even though this book is a book of creeds and beliefs, because <span style="color:#ff0000;">it is obligatory to believe in the obligation of stoning; and whoever denies it has become a disbeliever.</span> So therefore he stated it as a refutation of the innovators who deny stoning.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This hadeeth occurs as no. 30 in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth. It is reported by at-Tabaraaniyy in alMu`jamul-Kabeer, Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, ad-Daaraqutniyy in his Sunan, al-Haakim in his Mustadrak, al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa and others. It was declared hasan good by an-Nawawiyy in RiyaadusSaaliheen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translators side point:</strong> It occurs as a hadeeth of Aboo Tha`labah al-Khushaniyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said with regard to this narration in Ghaayatul-Maraam (no. 4), “This narration is actually da`eef (weak). Makhool did not meet Aboo Tha`labah.” However in the same book Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declares hasan (good) the narration which bears some resemblance with this one, which is the hadeeth of Abud-Dardaa· <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whatever Allaah made lawful in His book, then it is lawful. And whatever He made forbidden, then it is forbidden. And whatever He remained silent about, then it is pardoned. So accept from Allaah that which He has pardoned for Allaah would not forget anything.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord never forgets.</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth reported by al-Haakim and declared hasan by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1690) as a hadeeth of `Ubaadah ibnus-Saamit <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You also find that same narration from a different Companion reported by alBukhaariyy, also by Aboo Daawood, at-Timithiyy and Ibn Maajah. This wording actually occurring in the text is the wording of Ibn Maajah. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared it likewise saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6829). Also reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1691) from a narration of `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation that from the established Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed he stoned Maa`iz [reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6824)] and the woman connected with the employee [al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6828)] and the woman of the Juhaniyy tribe, al-Juhaniyyah [Muslim (no. 1696)]. And he stoned two Jews who had committed fornication [al-Bukhaariyy (no. 6841)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> passed away and this ruling remained being acted upon. And the khulafaa· stoned after him.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.&#8221;</strong></span> &#8211;  Surah No.17 Al-Isra , Aaayat 32</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, forbidding His servants to commit Zina or to approach it or to do anything that may lead to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (immoral sin)) meaning a major sin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and an evil way.)</strong> meaning, a terrible way to behave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, <strong>&#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commit Zina (unlawful sex).&#8221;</strong> The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; But the Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Come close)</strong> The young man came to him, and he ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Sit down)</strong> so he sat down. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their mothers.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your daughter)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their daughters. )</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your sister)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their sisters.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your paternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.)</strong> The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Would you like it for your maternal aunt)</strong> He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.&#8221; The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.)</strong> Then the Prophet ﷺ put his hand on him and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.)</strong> After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Chapter 14: We do not Call a Muslim an Unbeliever Due to his Sins</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] Ahl us-Sunnab believe that if a Believer commits sins, however small or large they may be, he does not become an unbeliever. If he leaves this world without making any repentance from them and he dies upon Tawheed and Ikhlaas, then his affair is entirely up to Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic. If He wills, He may forgive him and enter him into Paradise on the Day of judgement, safe and sound without being afflicted by the fire and without being punished for his perpetration of the sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will be brought on the Day of judgement with his sins and misdeeds. If Allaah wills, He will punish him for a period in the Fire. If He punishes him, he will not however remain in the Fire forever, but he will eventually be freed and taken out from it, to the place of tranquility and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[101] Our Shaykh, the Imaam Aboo Tayyeb Sahl ibn Muhammad as- Sa’lookee, raheemahullaah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The sinning believer, even if he is punished by the fire, he will not be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire. He will not remain there the same way as the unbeliever will remain there nor will he be wretched and miserable the same way the unbeliever is wretched and miserable.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[102] This means that the unbeliever will be dragged to the Fire on his face, he will be thrown in there chained, and then hung upside down, shackled by having his hands tied to his neck with strong and heavy chains. However, the sinning believer, if he is afflicted by the Fire, he will enter it like a criminal enters a prison in this world on his feet, not upside down nor thrown in. The meaning of his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;he will not, be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire&#8230;,” means that the unbeliever will have all his body burned and every time his skin is roasted through it will be replaced with another, so that he may taste the punishment again, as Allaah informs us in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, those who have disbelieved in our signs, we shall burn them in a fire. We shall change their skins for other skins, so that they may taste the punishment again.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4;56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believers they will not have their faces scorched by the Fire, and their limbs which they used for sujood will not be burned. For Allaah has forbidden the Fire from burning them. “ [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[103] His saying: “&#8230;he will not stay in the Fire like the unbeliever would&#8230;”, means that the unbeliever will remain in it forever and never come out of it. Allaah will never leave any sinning believer in the Fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “&#8230;he will not be afflicted like the unbeliever”, means that the unbeliever has no hope of the Mercy of Allah and no opportunity for reprieve from the punishment. As for the believer he will never be cut off from the hope of the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final outcome for all the believers is Paradise, as they were created for it and it was created for them, as a Mercy and a Blessing from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[113] The prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: &#8220;Allaah has forbidden the fire to eat up the traces of Sujood&#8221;. Related by al-Bukhaaree [806] and Muslim [182]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">What should a servant do when he is tried with a sin and he repents from it with a repentence where these three affairs (conditions) are fulfilled. But (then) he struggles with his heart regarding that sin, only to find that he fell into it (again).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Abdirraheem al-Bukhaaree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah bless you. I say: a sincere tawbah (repentance) requires an effort. Now, there is no command or prohibition &#8211; as Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said &#8211; except that Shaytaan (the devil) has two incitements regarding it: either to extremism or to negligence. He (i.e. Shaytaan) doesn&#8217;t care by which of these two he becomes victorious [over the servant]! The important thing (to him) is that you leave the Straight Path. Also, from his ways is that he doesn&#8217;t want you to be steadfast upon tawbah. He doesn&#8217;t want this! Because if you &#8211; the one he (Shaytaan) led astray and made fall into sin &#8211; are steadfast upon sincere tawbah and you adhere to obedience, he (Shaytaan) loses! Right? And this makes him feel very outraged, because he swore by Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> (Iblees (Shaytaan)) said: &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your sincere slaves amongst them (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38: 82-83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah bless you. Shaytaan beautifies the sin, this is why it has been narrated in the two Saheehs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Paradise is surrounded by things which are disliked and Hellfire is surrounded by desires (temptations).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this affair requires one to strive hard!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our Paths.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29: 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you must show Allaah that you are truthful!! And this is a kind of test: you repent sincerely, and then the soul which commands evil entices you. So then you are in a struggle between your soul which commands evil and your self-reproaching soul. This is a test to see if your repentance is truthful, if your intention is correct and if you are sincere to Allaah in leaving [this sin]. Just as it is obligatory upon you to be sincere to Allaah in [performing] that which is commanded, it is also obligatory upon you to be sincere to Allaah in leaving [the prohibitions]. It is obligatory that you are sincere to Allaah in leaving [sins]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware, O beloved one! From the greatest means that lead to the servant being deprived of succes, is commiting sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We supplicate to the One Who is worshipped (Allaah) during every distress, then we forget Him when the distresses are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can we hope for an answer to our supplications, while we closed its path with sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I consider a man to have forgotten the knowledge that he learned because of a sin he commits.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Hilyah by Abu Nu&#8217;aym]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should beware! This is why the look is an arrow from the arrows of Iblees, so a person should not continue looking, [listening to] whisperings, [listening to] suggestions [of Shaytaan], listening or other than that. So the more a person continues, the more he increases, and it is feared for him that Raan will cover his heart, about which Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn. </strong>[83:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge with Allaah! So beware! Sins are dangerous, by Allaah, O brothers! Dangerous and significant! And do not belittle [sins] by saying: “This is an insignificant sin,” “Is it from the minor or major sins?” Beware! In al-Bukhaaree on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You people do (bad) deeds (commit sins) which seem in your eyes tinier than hair, while we used to consider those (very deeds) during the life-time of the Prophet as destructive sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trust me completely: Whenever you are truthful to Allaah in seeking refuge with Him and throwing yourself with humility before Him with repentance and returning back, He will make you steadfast, He will help you, He will give you success and He will take away from you the most evil of evils, the plot of the sinners and the most evil calamities of the day and night. But whenever you continue [listening to] whisperings and suggestions [of Shaytaan], Shaytaan will cause you to backslide. So beware!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, the fact that the servant always talks to himself (i.e. reviews himself), that he is aware that Allaah always watches over him in all of his deeds and movements and that he seeks nearness to Him by staying away from sins: this is a proof of his truthfulness, with the permission of Allaah. This heat that you feel because of this struggle in the inside, will result in coldness, certainty and security for you, if you are truthful to Allaah. This is why Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are truthful (in words and deeds). </strong>[9:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being truthful in words and deeds is a must! In words and deeds! And from the greatest of this, is that we are truthful to Allaah when we seek His forgiveness and when we return back to Him, the Majestic and Mighty! Is this clear, O brothers? So beware of continuing! Strive against your soul!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trust me completely: it is only a small amount of days. The Prophet &#8211; sallal-Laahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said, as mentioned in as-Saheeh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Victory is only an hour of patience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shaytaan requires struggle (Jihaad)! Right? He requires a great struggle! You have to struggle against him night and day! And the Prophet &#8211; sallal-Laahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam &#8211; has informed us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When any one of you goes to sleep, Shaytaan ties three knots at the back of his neck, and says: &#8220;You have a long night, so sleep.&#8221;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaytaan is with you! And he wages war against you from every place! It is not possible for you to be saved from him, except by seeking refuge with Allaah. This is why Allaah commanded you to seek help from Him and to seek refuge with Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of the daybreak.&#8221; </strong>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: &#8220;I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of mankind.&#8221; </strong>[114:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the noble, merciful Prophet &#8211; the one whom Allaah sent as a mercy to mankind &#8211; advised you, guided you, directed you and clarified to you the Path of salvation, which is adhering to the Sunnah:  the adhkaar (supplications) for the morning and the evening <strong>[1]</strong>, the adhkaar for entering and leaving the toilet, sleeping, eating, drinking, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Review yourself! I say: review yourself and examine yourself: are you from those who are steadfast upon the Sunnah or negligent regarding it? How should you call yourself to account except in this way? And praise and thank Allaah that you are alive! Praise and thank Allaah that you are alive! And I have mentioned this to the students and brothers, here or in a previous lesson &#8211; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How should this (calling oneself to account) happen? You have a notebook and a pen with you, and you want to know? Call yourself to account before you are called to account! You have a notebook with you [and you write]: Bismillaahi ar-Rahmaani ar-Raheem. Today, saturday or sunday. We start from Fajr; did you wake up before Fajr or after Fajr? [Mention this] to yourself, not in the radio! Did I wake up in time? Did I catch the Sunnah of Fajr or not? Of course before this [you mention]: have I prayed witr or not? Yes/no. Did I pray Fajr in congregation? Yes. Did I catch Takbeeratul-Ihraam? Yes/no. Have I said the adhkaar after the prayer <strong>[2]</strong>? Yes/no. The adhkaar for the morning and the evening? Yes/no. Did I recite my (daily) part of the Qur&#8217;aan? Etc, etc etc. Did I backbite? Have I commited something prohibited? Write down! You will see in the end of the day that you have [written] pages! Yes, no, yes, no&#8230; Review [yourself]!Yes: I stay upon the truth. No: review it the next day; are you still upon this or have you left it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, this affair is significant! It is not trivial!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>..in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years. </strong>[70:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, it is a must that we prepare an answer for this Day! We ask Allaah to be kind and gentle to us and you, to give us and you a good ending and to make us all steadfast upon Islaam and Sunnah. And may Allaah raise the rank of the Messenger of Allaah, his family and his Companions and grant them peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong> Authentic adhkaar for the morning and the evening</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2]</strong> Authentic adhkaar to be said after the obligatory prayer</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s Explanation: [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[10] The selections here are from Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn. Since the chapter in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn where the ḥadīth under discussion appears includes preceding verses of the Quran related to lowering one’s gaze, his explanation of those verses have also been included here for the benefit it contains and its relevancy to this translated work.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The chapter in al-Nawawī’s Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (in which the ḥadīth under discussion appears) begins with the following verses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Tell the believers to lower their gaze.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Sūrah al-Nūr (24:30)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at non-relative women is forbidden as the author رحمه الله says and that is because Allah commanded that we lower our gaze as He says &#8220;<strong>Tell the believers to lower their gaze and preserve their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of what you do</strong>.&#8221; He instructs us to lower our gaze and guard our private parts, and this indicates that when someone does not restrain his gaze, that becomes the very means by which he may fail to preserve his private parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is liberal with his eyes, allowing them to roam freely, his heart becomes infatuated with women. He continues to look at them until he may approach a woman, speak to her, carry on a conversation with her, arrange a date with her, and then finally the immorality (of adultery) happens. We seek protection with Allah from this. This is why the look has been called “the messenger” or “delivery” of adultery; it invites to illegal sexual activity, and this is why Allah commands us to lower our gaze.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He عز وجلalso says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit and what the breasts conceal&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Ghāfir (40:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;eyes’ deceit&#8221; is the visions a person’s sight may steal (when looking at impermissible things). In other words, a person may secretly look at something forbidden when people cannot observe him. However, Allah certainly knows what he is doing because &#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah جل وعلى also knows &#8220;what the breasts conceal&#8221; of both good and bad intentions. He even knows the ideas a person’s own soul may inwardly suggest to him and what he accepts of those suggestions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah تعالى also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Surely the hearing, the sight, and the heart – of each of those one will be questioned&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Isrā (17:36)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person is accountable for his hearing and will be questioned about it. What did he listen to with his ears? Did he listen to impermissible speech or to a woman, enjoying the sound of her voice? Likewise an individual is accountable for his sight and heart so it is critical that a person safeguards himself (regarding his senses). As for a woman relative or someone to whom it would be forbidden for him to marry anyway, there is no problem with looking at her. He may see her face, her head, her hands, her arms, her legs and feet; there is no problem with any of this unless there is some sort of temptation he fears for himself. If he feels there would be some temptation for him, then he should not even look at women that are religiously considered as his female kin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a man had a “sister” because his mother breastfed another girl in infancy who was originally unrelated to him, if such a woman was considered beautiful in his eyes, then looking at her would not be permissible even though a sister of breastfeeding is considered by the religion to be of the same status of an actual, related sister. If he feels some kind of temptation by looking at her, he must then lower his gaze when with her. She must also cover up when she is with him because the origin and purpose behind the ḥijāb (the religious covering) is to prevent temptations. So if she finds some sort of temptation, then she too must cover her face even in front of related men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if there is no such temptation present and a person is chaste with a normal, sound and un-perverted heart, then he is only forbidden to look at nonrelative women not in his immediate family, for example his cousins, his sisters-inlaw, etc. In conclusion, the important point is that a man may look at women religiously considered to be his immediate relatives as long as no sort of temptation is there. As for looking at unrelated women, they are never permissible for him to look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following ḥadīth, with the wording from Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, is the one mentioned in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (and the same one mentioned on pg. 2-3 of this work).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated that the prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It has been written upon the Son of Adam his share of adultery which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it. The two eyes, their adultery is looking (at what is forbidden). The two ears, their adultery is listening. The tongue, its adultery is speaking. The hand, its adultery is the touching, and the foot, its adultery is walking (toward adultery). The heart desires and hopes (for adultery) but the private parts either confirm that or deny it. » which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it « means every individual will carry out and realize his inevitable share of adultery, and there is no escape from it unless Allah protects him from doing so.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم then mentioned some examples such as,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two eyes, their adultery is looking « When a man looks at unrelated women, even if it is without desire, it is a form of adultery – adultery of the eye.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two ears, their adultery is listening « A man may listen to a woman speaking and become moved by her voice; this is the adultery of the ear. Similarly,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The hand, its adultery is the touching « which is anything physically done with the hand like touching or similar physical actions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» the foot, its adultery is walking « and this includes when someone walks to any place wherein immorality and sexual activity is being committed. It could also be when a man hears a woman’s voice and he walks over to her or sees a woman whom he then approaches. These are all types of adultery – adultery of the foot.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The heart desires « and may be inclined toward adultery, becoming infatuated with women and this is the adultery of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» but the private parts either confirm that or deny it « In other words, if a person commits adultery with his private parts—we seek protection with Allah from that—he has then actualized the adultery of all his other senses and limbs. In contrast, if he does not commit adultery with his private part, choosing instead to safeguard and preserve himself, he then denies his other senses their forms of adultery.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth shows the extreme caution required to prevent one’s heart from being attached to women. A man must avoid becoming obsessed with their voices, looking at them, touching them, or approaching them. He has to prevent his own heart’s infatuation with the allure of women as all of these are types of adultery, and we seek protection from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every individual of sound intellect and chastity must beware and take precautions to ensure nothing of his senses or body parts become obsessed with women. Anytime a person senses himself being allured to any of that, he must retreat and keep far away (from actualizing any forms of adultery) because Satan courses through the Son of Adam like blood runs through him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the initial glance can be a poisonous arrow from Iblīs. For example, a man may glance at a woman while unconcerned with her at first sight. However, with the second look then the third he finds his heart becoming attached to her, Allah forbid. He may become so in love with that woman that he thinks of nothing but her. Standing, sitting, when he sleeps and when he wakes up, he thinks of her. And this is how the evil and temptation begins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for wellbeing and all success is from Him.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This questioner asks, &#8216;<span style="color:#993300;">How does a person rejuvenate his heart after repeatedly sinning?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee Al-Madkhali</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He rejuvenates it <strong>firstly</strong> by distancing himself from sinning. This is the first thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, distancing himself from the reasons for sinning like bad company or similar things, looking at prohibited things or similar actions, listening to prohibited things or travelling to do prohibited things, (he leaves) every reason which leads to this (sinning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he distances himself from sinning by making <strong>Towbah</strong> (repentance) and he distances himself from sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, he is to <strong>sit with righteous people</strong>, those whom we previously spoke about. From these people are those whose companionship is like air, if it is cut off, you die, you breathe with them, and thus it is upon you to sit with the righteous. Be companions with them and stick with them as you acquire an immense amount of good by sitting with them. They protect you, with the grace of Allah and His mercy, from returning to that which you were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is upon you to <strong>increase your reading of the Quran</strong> and likewise it is upon you to beseech and <strong>supplicate to your Lord</strong> the Most High, the One who gives blessings, to protect you just as He gave you success to make Towbah (repentence), ask Him to protect you for as long as what remains from your life and put yourself before Allah frequently supplicating with this du&#8217;a. Ask Allah to have mercy upon you, to protect you and make you steadfast, and to make your heart firm. Increase making du&#8217;a for these things as verily Allah the Most High does not dissapoint the one who supplicates to Him.</p>

But if he does fear (harm) from that, then he is obligated to <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>reject the backbiting with his heart</strong></span> and to <strong><span style="color:#993300;">detach himself</span></strong> from that gathering if he is able to do so. If he has the ability to reject it with his tongue or to cut the backbiting off by changing the topic, then that becomes required of him. And if he does not do that, then he has committed an act of disobedience (i.e. sinned).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is forced to stay in that gathering in which backbiting is taking place, and he fears from forbidding it, or he forbids it but it is not accepted from him and he cannot find a way to separate himself from them, then he is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>prohibited from listening</strong></span> and paying attention to the backbiting. Instead, his way out should be by <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>making remembrance of Allaah (dhikr)</strong></span> with both his tongue and heart or just his heart. Or he should <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>think about something else</strong></span> in order to preoccupy himself from having to listen to it. After having done this, his hearing it without listening or paying attention to it will not harm him, while he is in this mentioned state. If he is able, after this, to withdraw from them and they are still backbiting, then separating oneself is an obligation. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when you see those who engage in false conversations about Our verses by mocking at them, then turn away from them until they engage in a different topic of speech. But if the Devil causes you to forget, then after remembering, do not sit in the company of those people who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah AlAn’aam: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that <strong>Ibraaheem bin Adham</strong> was once invited to a waleemah (wedding feast), so he attended it and found people there who were mentioning a man that didn’t come, saying: &#8220;He is truly lazy.&#8221; So Ibraaheem said: &#8220;I brought this upon myself, such that I attended a place in which people are backbiting one another.&#8221; So he left from there and did not eat for three days. What has been recited of poetry with regard to this is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“And restrain your ears from hearing vile speech<br />
Just as you restrain your tongue from speaking it<br />
Because when you listen to this vile speech<br />
You are a partner to the one saying it, so reflect.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Should One Do When He Hears His Shaikh, Friend Or Someone Else Being Backbitten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is upon the one who hears a Muslim being backbitten to oppose it and prevent the one doing the backbiting. If he is not able to prevent him with his speech, then he should stop him with his hand. If he is neither able to do so with his hand or with his tongue, then he should get up and leave that gathering. And if he hears his teacher (shaikh) being backbitten – or anyone else who has a right over him, or if the person (being backbitten) is from the people of righteousness and nobility, then his concern with what we have mentioned above should be greater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So O you human being, who stands in need and who was created for a tremendous matter, you for whom the Hellfire and the Gardens of Bliss were created, if you devote your attention to the <strong>musical instruments</strong> with your ears; and you <strong>look at what Allaah forbade</strong> with your eyes; and you <strong>eat doubtful matters</strong> with your mouth, allowing them to enter your stomach; and you are pleased with yourself <strong>dancing and swaying</strong>; and you waste all of your precious time engaged in these despicable acts; and you throw away your life, which has no value, in trying to attain these condemnable things; and you busy your body, which was created for worship, with that which Allaah forbade for His servants; and you <strong>sit in the gathering of the people of falsehood</strong>; and you perform the acts of the sinners and the ignorant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will come to know, when the cover has been lifted, and the Command (of Allaah) comes to pass, what will befall you from regret on the Day when you see the positions of those who have preceded (you) and the reward of those who did good deeds. While you will be with those who were left behind, the squanderers, and you will be counted as being in the company of the people of falsehood, the neglectful. You have stopped proceeding, the pains have befallen you, and your regrets have become tremendous. For on that Day, the one who cries will not be shown mercy, nor will the one who complains be listened to. Nor will the one who regrets be comforted. Nor will anyone be saved from the Torment of Allaah except for he who is granted mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah awaken you and us from the sleep of heedlessness, and may He enable you and us to perform what He created us for (i.e. worship), by His mercy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 14777</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a married woman with children and I am a practicing Muslim &#8211; all praise be to Allah &#8211; but my husband smokes<strong> Shisha (hookah, water pipe)</strong>. I have advised him, in vain, to give it up. In fact, he has sworn by Allah that he will stop smoking it, but he has not done so. After this, I took an oath by Allah that, if he did not stop smoking, I would go to my parents, but he has not stopped and I have not gone to my parents. What should I do with my husband? What is the ruling on the oath that I took? What is the ruling on smoking Shisha? I hope that you will answer my letter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>: smoking shisha is Haram (prohibited) because it is an obnoxious habit and includes many harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: It is Wajib (obligatory) on your husband to fulfill his oath and stop smoking Shisha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You have done well to advise your husband to stop smoking Shisha. You should continue doing so and make Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah for Him to guide your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the oath that you broke, you have to make Kaffarah (expiation) for it and you should not go to stay with your parents.The Kaffarah is to feed ten Miskin (needy people), to clothe them, or to free a believing slave. If you are unable to do any of these things, you should observe Sawm (Fasting) for three days.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Ruling on smoking and using hookah &#8211; Shaykh Ibn Baaz</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on smoking and using hookah? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Smoking and using hookah are prohibited, because they contain evil and much harm. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made lawful for His servants all kinds of lawful and good things and made unlawful to them all kinds of evil things, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says to His Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: &#8220;Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful-good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]</span>. Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says with regard to the description of His Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&#8221;  </span>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 157</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No type of smoking is from the lawful good things, but they are from the evil things due to their much harm. They are not from the lawful-good things which Allah (Exalted be He) permitted; therefore, they should be abandoned and o<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ne should beware of approaching them and should strive against his evil soul to avoid these evil things, because the soul persists in evil, except those relieved by Allah&#8217;s Mercy.</strong></span> It is the duty of the believer to strive against his soul to set aside whatever harms him from these and other evil things.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. <strong>In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette</strong>. The chemical compositions of cigarette smoke and hookah smoke are different, however, as the workings of the charcoal in the modern hookah causes the tobacco mixture to be heated to a lower temperature, as opposed to the higher temperature in a cigarette where the tobacco is directly burnt. Consequently, the potential health effects of hookah smoke are expected to be very different.<sup id="cite_ref-Saad_58-0" class="reference"><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">فتاوى نور على الدرب :Original Title<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5;">Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Sudanese brothers living in the kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) in the city of Bāḥah asks: The people of the Sunnah and the mainstream community of Muslims state that the final destination of those who worship Allah with <em>Tawḥīd</em> – the Muslim monotheists – will eventually be Paradise. Yet there have come examples in some <em>ḥadīth </em>(prophetic narrations) that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ قَاطِعُ رَحْم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ نَمَّامٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“A slanderer will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, will the Muslim monotheists who happen to fall into these two groups never enter Paradise as is apparent from these texts, or how do we understand them?</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts pertaining to threats and others similar to them, whether from <em>ḥadīth</em> or verses of the Qur&#8217;aan, are what led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/">Khawārij</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/">Mu’tazilah</a> </strong>sects to state that anyone who commits a major sin will remain forever in the fire (of Hell). This is because they take these general texts and forget other general ones that conflict (and must be taken along) with these. And there are many proofs that state that Muslim monotheists or those with faith in their hearts even equal to a seed’s worth will not remain in the fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the generality of the texts pertaining to hopes and promises that mention that believers will enter Paradise led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/">Murjiah</a> </strong>sect to disregard the texts of threats. They said that any believer, even if he were a wicked sinner, would never enter the fire. So, these people take only these general texts and those others sects take only the general texts of threats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allah has guided the people of the Sunnah and the main community of Muslims to the middle, moderate belief that combines the understanding of both evidences in conjunction. This belief is that someone who commits a major sin does not thereby completely leave his faith. He may be deserving of punishment but Allah could simply forgive him and not put him into the fire, or perhaps someone else could pray for him and as a result Allah may not punish him. His punishment could also be expiated by other means. However, if no means are present whereby he can avoid punishment, then he may be punished in the fire according to the extent of his action, and after that he would be in Paradise. This is the methodology and understanding of the people of Sunnah and the community of mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, the general <em>ḥadīth</em> of threats like those the questioner mentioned: “<span style="color:#808000;">Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise</span>,” and “<span style="color:#808000;">A slanderer will not enter Paradise</span>,” <span style="color:#0000ff;">are understood to mean that such people will not enter Paradise by a perfect, absolute entrance without punishment</span>. Rather, punishment may precede that (his entrance to Paradise) if nothing wipes out that sin like Allah’s forgiveness or something else. So the meaning is he will not enter Paradise absolutely and perfectly without some sort of punishment preceding that; by this meaning all the evidences are understood together (with no contradiction).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Most mobiles have musical ring tones. Is it permissible to use these musical tones instead of the regular ring tone?  Could you kindly advise and direct us to what is beneficial for Muslims? May Allah reward you and protect you from harm! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to use musical tones</strong></span> on mobiles or other devices, because listening to musical instruments is prohibited as indicated by Shar‘y (Islamic legal) evidence. It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>enough to use the regular ring tone</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 6430</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on a Muslim who boards a crowded plane and is forced to one of the following cases?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">1. A group of women surround him; two on each side, one in front of him and a fourth one behind him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 2. He sits face to face with a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) woman, Arab or other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 3. He sits beside a non-Mahram woman who may be very old.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 4. His seat faces the flight hostess who sits in her seat for a short period after takeoff and before landing of the plane. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes, there are no empty seats left on the plane, or the passengers refuse to exchange seats so that the crew cannot do anything to help him change an inappropriate situation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>If traveling by plane is necessary and the cases you mentioned are inevitable, you should choose the case which involves less Fitnah (temptation) based on the rule of applying the lesser of two harms or evils. Additionally, you should lower your gaze as much as possible.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>However, if traveling by plane is not necessary and you have other alternatives, you should avoid that to guard your faith.</strong></span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi -Rahimullaah-<br />
Translated by Umm Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed a slave commits a sin and enters Paradise through committing it and he performs a good deed and enters the Hellfire through performing it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked ‘How is this (possible)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A sin is committed and thus does not cease to be before his eyes (causing him to be) fearful of it, concerned about it frightened and weeping due to his regret of doing it. Feeling ashamed due to this action before his Lord The Most High, with his head lowered between his hands, and his heart broken and despondent due to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore that sin will be more beneficial to him than numerous acts of obedience could be. As a consequence these previously mentioned matters are the cause for this slave of Allaah’s happiness and success until that sin will be a reason for him to enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A slave of Allaah performs a good deed and he continues to view it as if he has performed a favour for his Lord and is egotistic due to that good deed, and he is conceited, vain and arrogant due to the sin. So he says I did such and such action (boasting) causing to him to inherit the characteristic of pride, haughtiness and adopting an overbearing attitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This becomes the reason for his destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if Allaah Ta’ala intends good for the needy slave He trials him with something in order to bring him down and to lower his neck in humiliation and to decrease his importance to himself. However if Allaah intended for him (the slave) anything other than good He (Allaah) would have left him alone and his vanity and pride and this is the deception which necessitates his destruction.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh AbdusSallaam bin Salim bin Raja’ as-Suhaymee</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdusSallaam as-Suhaymee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the issue of speaking about Suicide missions, is that whether the person who is fought against, is he actually from the combatants, and that <em>Jihad</em> in reality is facing the <em>Kuffar</em> in  a battle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suicide Missions have become a modern day fashion, and many people are sympathetic with the one who carries it out by looking at the goal behind these missions.  The sympathetic person finds it sufficient from these missions that the intent of executing these missions is to raise the statement of <em>Tawheed</em>, and to aid Islaam and humble the<em>Kuffar</em> as they claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is the <em>Sharia’</em> ruling regarding these Suicide Missions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Ends Do not Justify the Means]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is known from the <em>Sharia’</em> that a good intention on its own is not sufficient to allow an action to be permissible according to the <em>Sharia’</em>.  These people, who carry out Suicide Missions, propel themselves by saying that the means to the end take the same rulings of the intended goals, so if the goal is legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> then its means are also legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em>.  However this is not acceptable, because the ends do not justify the means absolutely, rather it is obligatory that the means also have to be legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> to fulfill the goals in the <em>Sharia’</em>.  As for, if the means are not legislated in the <em>Sharia’</em> then it is not sufficient for the goal to be legislated.  The principle for this is mentioned in Bukhari and Muslim from the saying of the Messenger<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ( من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action which is not in accordance with the command of Allaah or His Messenger then it is rejected (Allaah does not accept it) from the one who does it, no matter how good his intention was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now that this point has been established, then indeed the well regarded scholars of today hold the view that these acts of suicide are not permissible, and from these scholars are: the respected Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Baz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>, and the noble Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen, the respected Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Abdullaah Alaa-Shaykh, the noble Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan, and Shaykh AbdulAzeez ar-Rajihi, and Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Ubaykan and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sharia’</em> proofs from the Book and the Sunnah and the intellect, show that these operations are <em>Haram</em> according to the <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Book of Allaah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;  إِنْ يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ الْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِثْلُهُ وَتِلْكَ الْأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ النَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنْكُمْ شُهَدَاءَ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الظَّالِمِينَ   &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allaah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allaah likes not the <em>Zâlimûn </em>(polytheists and wrong­doers).&gt;&gt;[Ala-Imraan: 140]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being: that this <em>Ayaah</em> contains the evidence for a principle, which is, that seeking martyrdom in the path of Allaah is a selection made by Allaah and the choice of Allaah Subhanahu, and it is not for everyone who wants to be a martyr. The view that it is permissible to carry out suicide missions to kill the enemy nullifies this principle. The proof for this point in this <em>Ayaah</em> is the saying of Allaah Subhanahu: &lt;&lt; آمَنُوا وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنْكُمْ شُهَدَاءَ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;and that He may take martyrs from among you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the One who chooses who is martyred in His Way. As for the one who commits suicide to kill the enemy then he is not a martyr, because he himself has appointed the time in  which to die, and this in the <em>Sharia’</em> is defined as suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, Allaah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties; for the price that theirs shall be Paradise. They fight in Allaah’s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. &gt;&gt; [Tawbah:111]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَوْ يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;and whoso fights in the Cause of Allaah, and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being from these two <em>Ayaat</em>: that the one who kills himself with explosives or in other ways wanting to kill the enemy then it is not correct to label him as a martyr;<strong>because the martyr is the one who is killed by the enemy. </strong>In the first <em>Ayaah</em>those that have been promised Paradise are two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The combatant and the one killed by the enemy. And in the second <em>Ayaah</em>: the one promised with great reward is the one who is killed by the enemy or the one who is victorious, however whoever kills himself with explosives does not enter under the meaning of these two <em>Ayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا () وَمَنْ يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ عُدْوَانًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:29-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being: This <em>Ayaah</em> generally includes a person committing suicide, and these type of suicide operations include killing the innocent, from women, old people and children, and there is no doubt that this is from transgression and oppression, and the one who carries out a suicide mission is deserving of this severe warning and it applies to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Sunnah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From Abu Huraira &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu- </em>who said: That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قتل نفسه بحديدة فحديدته في يده يتوجأ بها في بطنه في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا و من شرب سما فقتل نفسه فهو يتحساه في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا و من تردى من جبل فقتل نفسه فهو يتردى في نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا فيها أبدا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever jumps off a mountain and kills himself, he will be jumping off into the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From Thaabit bin Dhihak that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قتل نفسه بشيء عذب به يوم القيامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever kills himself with something  then he will be punished with that thing on the day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- From Abu Huraira &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu- </em>who said: That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الذي يخنق نفسه يخنقها في النار و الذي يطعنها يطعنها في النار</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever strangles himself then he will strangle himself in the Hell-Fire, and whoever stabs himself then he will stab himself in the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof being from these <em>Ahadeeth</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That these <em>Ahadeeth</em> generally show that it is prohibited for a person to kill himself no matter what the reasons are, and this includes everyone that kills himself with whichever means used.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Intellect:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That these operations indeed bring a backlash with a greater evil consequence upon Islaam and the Muslims, whether that is in Palestine or in any other place.  These operations in reality show contempt and scorn of the blood of the Muslims, and sacrifices for these operations are with no benefit worth mentioning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- That these operations actually <strong>fulfill the aims of the enemies of Islaam</strong> in an indirect way, by giving the enemies of Islaam the excuse by which they have fulfilled their aims in the easiest way, along with the clear weakness of the Muslims in defending themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- That these suicide missions which are aimed at other than those who are combatants from women, children and old people are a deterrent against the  <em>Deen</em> of Allaah, because of the oppression of these suicide missions and their harshness, cheating, treachery, lying and all of these are contradictory to the <em>Sharia’</em> of Islaam, all of them are contradictory and the explanation of that is from the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First point: that the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is the <em>Deen</em> of justice even in dealing with the enemy, so their oppression against the Muslims does not in turn justify oppressing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَنْ صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ أَنْ تَعْتَدُوا وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from <em>Al-­Masjid­ al-­Haraam </em>(in Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help one another in <em>Al-­Birr </em>and <em>At-­Taqwa </em>(virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment.&gt;&gt; [Maidah:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Well­Acquainted with what you do.&gt;&gt; [Maidah:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the Hadeeth <em>Qudsi</em> that Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O My worshippers, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.’ [Collected by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that aiming for innocent people and killing them due to the crime of someone else is from the severest of <em>Dhulm</em> (oppression).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second point: that the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is the <em>Deen</em> of mercy and doing goodness, and this is not just to human beings alone, but even to animals, and these suicide missions are in contradiction to mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third point: That the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam is a <em>Deen</em> of courage and sacrifice, and it is not courage to hide behind treachery and deception. Indeed Allaah ordered us at the inception of fighting a people, between whom we have a contract with or at the time we fear from them an action, Allaah ordered us to give them an announcement of war before launching war against them.  Allaah – Subhanahu – said: &lt;&lt; وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِنْ قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَانْبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَى سَوَاءٍ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْخَائِنِينَ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;If you fear treachery from any people throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms (that there will be no more covenant between you and them). Certainly Allaah likes not the treacherous.&gt;&gt; [Anfal:58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah obligated upon us that even in war with them that we do not kill except those who fight us from amongst their men. And these people who carryout suicide missions commit a great crime against Islaam and the Muslims, so they ascribed Islaam to oppression, treachery and cheating. Islaam is not aided with oppression nor with cheating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What becomes clear from what has preceded, from the clear, authentic evidence that suicide operations are not allowed, which some have entitled: ‘martyr missions’ and that those who hold it to be permissible do not have any clear authentic proof what so ever, and what they use as proof for its permissibility is either a proof which is not authentic or it does not indicate to what they claim, and no one rejects this point except an ignorant person or someone who follows his desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken From: ‘Jihad fee Islaam’ by Shaykh AbdusSallaam as-Suhaymee p.112 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">From Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a person commits suicide due to the circumstances of life and what he experiences of hardships of living and spending upon his family, would this mean that, that person will stay in Hell-fire?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All praise be to Allaah, <em>Sallat</em> and <em>Sallam</em> be upon the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suicide is a great evil, and it is a sin from the major sins.  It is not permissible for a Muslim to commit Suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. &gt;&gt; 4:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said in an authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever commits suicide using something then he will be punished using that thing on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon a believer is that he forces himself to have patience and resilience if a catastrophe befalls him and he endures difficulties in his <em>Dunyaa</em>matters.  He should not be hasty in committing suicide, rather he should be warned against that, and fear Allaah, and he should be patient and utilize the means to keep away from committing suicide, and whoever fears Allaah then Allaah will make a way out for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person commits suicide then he risks the Anger of Allaah and His punishment, and that person is under the Will of Allaah, this is because committing suicide is less than<em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Subhanahu –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. &gt;&gt; 4:48</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <strong>whatever is less than <em>Shirk</em> then it is under the Will of Allaah</strong>, and committing suicide is less then <em>Shirk</em>, likewise is <em>Zina</em> (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.  All of these things are sins that are less than <em>Shirk</em>, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.  If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after he is purified and cleared he will be taken out of the Fire, and according to the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em> <strong>he will not stay in the Hell-Fire</strong> for eternity. A sinner will not stay in the Fire for eternity, nor will a murderer, nor any other sinner, however if Allaah wants He will give him His punishment.  Allaah punishes whomsoever He wills in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of that person’s sins, then Allaah takes him out of the Fire to a river, which is called, the river of life, and he is planted there just like a seed is planted and grows on the sides of the banks of a torrential river. When that person’s growth has been completed, then Allaah enters him into Paradise due to his Islaam and his <em>Eemaan</em> upon which he dies. Only the disbeliever will stay in the Fire for eternity, only the disbelieving <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists) those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messenger, or those that belie Allaah’s Messengers, or that reject what Allaah’s Messengers brought, or other things similar to these of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the sinner, then according to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em> he will not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, and this is in contrast to the position of the Khawarij and the Mu’atazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed groups from the Khawarij and Mu’atazilah – and they are two misguided groups – say that a sinner will stay in the Hell-Fire forever, if he enters it!  And this is a grave mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em>, and they are the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible.  However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reoccurring Ahadeeth from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about this point, namely that some people will enter the Fire due to their sins then Allaah will take them out of the Fire due to the intercession of the intercessors, or with Allaah’s mercy without anyone’s intercession, and all of this is established from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Rebelling with the Sword and Performing <em>Takfeer</em>Due to Major Sins<br />
Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br />
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>The Major Sin – Forty-Nine</strong></p>
<p>Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<strong>… but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah does not like the transgressors.</strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 190]</p>
<p>Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; <strong>And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in clear misguidance.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p><strong>316-</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “Whoever says to his Muslim brother, O <em>Kafir</em> (disbeliever)!’ Then verily it returns to one of them.”[1]</p>
<p>There are many narrations which describe the Khawarij, and the people differed in performing <em>Takfeer</em> (taking people out of the fold of Islaam) upon them, since the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said about them:  “they will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them.“[2]</p>
<p><strong>318 &#8211;</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said about them: “They are the most evil of those killed under the sky, and the best person killed is the one who is killed by them.”[3]</p>
<p>So the Khawarij are the people of <em>Bida’</em>, they make it <em>Halaal</em> to take the blood of people, and they perform <em>Takfeer</em>. They performed<em>Takfeer</em> upon ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee and of a group from the pre-eminent Companions- may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>319</strong>&#8211; Ishaaq al-Azzraq, on the authority of al-‘Amash, on the authority of Ibn Abu ‘Awfaa <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> say: The Khawaarij are the dogs of the Hell-fire.[4]</p>
<p><strong>320-</strong> Hashraj bin Nubaatata, said Sa’eed bin Jumhaan narrated to me that he said: I entered upon Ibn Abu ‘Awfaa and he was blind, and he said: who are you?</p>
<p>I said: Sa’eed bin Jumhaan.</p>
<p>He said: What happened to your father?</p>
<p>I said: The al-Azzariqa (who are a sect from the Khawarij) killed him.</p>
<p>He said: May Allaah kill the al-Azzariqa! Then he said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> narrated to us that they are the dogs of the hell fire.</p>
<p>I asked: only the al-Azzariqa?</p>
<p>He said: All the Khawarij.[5]</p>
<p><strong>321-</strong> Hammad bin Salama said: Abu Hafs narrated to us, that he heard Abdullah bin Abu ‘Awfaa say while they were fighting the Khawarij: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say: “<em>Tooba </em>(a tree in paradise) for the one who kills them and is killed by them.”[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br />
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Major sin – Twenty-Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The One Who Commits Suicide which is from the Greatest of Sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves, indeed Allaah is Most Merciful to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah. If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall remit from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden……&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">191 – Narrated by Jundub ibn Abdullaah <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said, “Amongst the nations before you was a man who had a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop until he died. Allaah said, ‘My Slave hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">192 – Narrated Abu Huraira <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever; “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">193 – In an authentic hadeeth: A person was wounded, he hurried death and killed himself with the tip of his sword, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “He is from the people of the fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">194 – It is narrated on the authority of Yahya bin Abee Katheer, on the authority of Abee Qilaaba, on the authority of Thabit bin al-Dahhak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  said : “Cursing a believer is like killing him, and whoever accuses a believer of <em>Kufr</em> then he is like his killer, and he who killed himself with something in this world then Allaah will punish him with that (very thing) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;Al-Buyoo&#8217; al-Munhee &#8216;anhaa&#8221; (pg. 12-15)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And from the forbidden types of business is: Selling a forbidden commodity. This is because when Allaah makes something forbidden, He also makes taking money for it forbidden, such as when someone sells something that is forbidden to be sold. Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade that dead animals, khamr (i.e. wine), swine and statues be sold So whoever sells dead animals, i.e. meat for which no prescribed Zakaat was given, then he has sold a dead animal and earned unlawful money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes the same for selling khamr. What is meant by the word khamr is everything that intoxicates, based on the Prophet’s saying: <b>“Every intoxicant is khamr and every kind of khamr is Haraam (unlawful).”</b> And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) cursed ten people with regard to khamr, as is recorded in the authentic hadeeth: <b>“Verily Allaah cursed khamr – the one who produces it and the one for whom it is produced, the one who sells it and the one who buys it, the one who drinks it and the one who earns from the sale of it, the one who carries it and the one who it is carried to, and the one who serves it.”</b> Reported by At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khamr is every type of intoxicant regardless of whether it is called khamr or alcoholic beverages or liquor or wine or whiskey. It doesn’t matter if it is called by any of these or other names – changing the name does not change the fact that it is khamr. It has been reported in a hadeeth that <b>”There will come a people during the Last Days that will call khamr by another name and drink it.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, what is worse than this is selling narcotics, such as <b>hasheesh and opium</b>, as well as other types of drugs, which are being dealt out to the people in these days. So the one who sells it and deals it is a criminal in the eyes of the Muslims and in the eyes of the whole world. This is because drugs kill people, so it is like a destructive weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who sells drugs or distributes it or assists in its distribution – all of them fall under the curse of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And taking money from it is from the wickedest of acts and the most detestable of gains. Furthermore, the one who deals drugs deserves to be executed because he is one of those who cause mischief in the land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for selling <b>cigarettes and qaat</b> (leaves that are chewed in Arabian lands). Cigarettes are harmful and they cause diseases to occur. In fact, all of the characteristics of <i>khubth</i>(wickedness) are gathered together in cigarettes. There is no benefit in smoking in any way whatsoever. Its harms are many. The one with the worst kind of breath, the most despicable appearance and the most burdensome to accompany out of all people is the one who smokes cigarettes. If he sits next to you or he rides next to you in a car or on a plane, you feel constricted by the smoke he makes and its foul stench. The odor coming from his mouth is bad enough when he breathes in your face, so how much more so if he were to smoke in your presence and the cigarette smoke were to float in your face! The matter would be worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So smoking is wicked from all perspectives and there isn’t any benefit found in it. Therefore, it is forbidden without any hesitation or doubt. It is unlawful to smoke based on several perspectives, not just one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one smokes, he throws money away and he wastes time. Cigarettes disfigure the face, blacken the lips and stain the teeth. As for the diseases that are caused by it, then they are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people have been afflicted by it and yet they take it lightly and as something trivial. This is even to the point that some are suffering from its effects even though they never smoked and they hate smoking. However, they sold it to people because they loved to make money any way they could. But these people don’t know that this type of business spoils all of their earnings, because some of them mix the money they make from it with their business and so they spoil it, since (doing this) is forbidden and disobedience (to Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sustenance is not to be sought from Allaah through disobeying Him. Rather, sustenance and provision are to be sought from Allaah by way of obeying Him. Whatever Allaah has ordained for you from <i>rizq</i> (sustenance) will surely come to you. If you seek after it while being obedient to Allaah (in all that He commands and prohibits), He will facilitate it for you and bless your wealth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><b>Chapter 287<br />
Prohibition of taking Ar-Riba (The Usury)</b></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Those who eat Ar-Riba (the usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: `Trading is only like Ar-Riba, whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Ar-Riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Rubb and stops eating Ar-Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Ar-Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire &#8211; they will abide therein. Allah will destroy Ar-Riba and will give increase for Sadaqat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allah likes not the disbelievers, sinners. Truly, those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-As-Salat), and give Zakat, they will have their reward with their Rubb. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ar-Riba (from now onward)</b></span><b>.&#8221; (2:275-279)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahadith on the subject are many, including Hadith No. 1615.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1615.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) cursed the one who accepts Ar-Riba (the usury) and the one who pays it.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in At-Tirmidhi adds: And the one who records it, and the two persons who stand witness to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 17:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book Pertaining to Punishments Prescribed by Islam (Kitab Al-Hudud) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The penal laws of Islam are called Hudud in the Hadith and Fiqh. This word is the plural of Hadd, which means prevention, hindrance, restraint, prohibition, and hence a restrictive ordinance or statute of God, respecting things lawful and unlawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments are divided into two classes, one of which is called Hadd and the other Ta&#8217;zir. The Hadd is a measure of punishment defined by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In Ta&#8217;zir, the court, is allowed to use its discretion in regard to the form and measure in which such punishment is to be inflicted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments by way of Hadd are of the following forms: death by stoning, amputation of a limb or limbs, flogging by one hundred or eighty strokes. They are prescribed respectively for the following offences: adultery committed by married persons, theft, highway robbery, drunkenness and slander imputing unchastity to women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishments described above are the maximum punishments for the above mentioned crimes. These can be reduced keeping in view the circumstances in which the crimes were committed, the nature of the evidence, and the motive of the criminal with which he committed the crime.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id reported that a person belonging to the clan of Aslam, who was called Ma, iz b. Malik, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I have committed immorality (adultery), so inflict punishment upon me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) turned him away again and again. He then asked his people (about the state of his mind). They said: We do not know of any ailment of his except that he has committed something about which he thinks that he would not be able to relieve himself of its burden but with the Hadd being imposed upon him. He (Ma&#8217;iz) came back to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he commanded us to stone him. We took him to the Baqi&#8217; al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him. We attacked him with bones, with clods and pebbles. He ran away and we ran after him until he came upon the ston ground (al-Harra) and stopped there and we stoned him with heavy stones of the Harra until he became motionless (lie died). He (the Holy Prophet) then addressed (us) in the evening saying Whenever we set forth on an expedition in the cause of Allah, some one of those connected with us shrieked (under the pressure of sexual lust) as the bleating of a male goat. It is essential that if a person having committed such a deed is brought to me, I should punish him. He neither begged forgiveness for him nor cursed him.</p>

A person stood up and smelt his breath but noticed no smell of wine. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Have you committed adultery? He said: Yes. He made pronouncement about him and he was stoned to death. The people had been (divided) into two groups about him (Ma&#8217;iz). One of them said: He has been undone for his sins had encompassed him, whereas another said: There is no repentance more excellent than the repentance of Ma&#8217;iz, for he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and placing his hand in his (in the Holy Prophet&#8217;s) hand said: Kill me with stones. (This controversy about Ma&#8217;iz) remained for two or three days. Then came Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to them (his Companions) as they were sitting. He greeted them with salutation and then sat down and said: Ask forgiveness for Ma&#8217;iz b. Malik. They said: May Allah forgive Ma&#8217;iz b. Malik. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He (Ma&#8217;iz) has made such a repentance that if that were to be divided among a people, it would have been enough for all of them. He (the narrator) said: Then a woman of Ghamid, a branch of Azd, came to him and said: Messenger of of Allah, purify me, whereupon he said: Woe be upon you; go back and beg forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance. She said: I find that you intend to send me back as you sent back Ma&#8217;iz. b. Malik. He (the Holy, Prophet) said: What has happened to you? She said that she had become pregnant as a result of fornication. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it you (who has done that)? She said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said to her: (You will not be punished) until you deliver what is there in your womb. One of the Ansar became responsible for her until she was delivered (of the child). He (that Ansari) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said the woman of Ghamid has given birth to a child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: In that case we shall not stone her and so leave her infant with none to suckle him. One of the Ansar got up and said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, let the responsibility of his suckling be upon me. She was then stoned to death.</p>

They denied of any such thing in him and said: We do not know him but as a wise good man among us, so far as we can judge. He (Ma&#8217;iz) came for the third time, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent him as he had done before. He asked about him and they informed him that there was nothing wrong with him or with his mind. When it was the fourth time, a ditch was dug for him and he (the Holy Prophet) pronounced judg- ment about him and he wis stoned.

He said: Well, if you insist upon it, then go away until you give birth to (the child). When she was delivered she came with the child (wrapped) in a rag and said: Here is the child whom I have given birth to. He said: Go away and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she came to him (the Holy Prophet) with the child who was holding a piece of bread in his hand. She said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the child to one of the Muslims and then pronounced punishment. And she was put in a ditch up to her chest and he commanded people and they stoned her. Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) heard his (Khalid&#8217;s) curse that he had huried upon her. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made such a repentance that even if a wrongful tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgiven. Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.</p>

He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I would not have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as punishment prescribed in the Torah). But this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us argree (on a punishment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor. So We decided to blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, I am the first to revive Thy command when they had made it dead. He then commanded and he (the offender) was stoned to death.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah curses a man who steals an egg and gets his hand cut off, or steals a rope and gets his hands cut off.&#8221; Al-A&#8217;mash said, &#8220;People used to interpret the Baida as an iron helmet, and they used to think that the rope may cost a few dirhams.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet in a gathering and he said, &#8216;Swear allegiance to me that you will not worship anything besides Allah, Will not steal, and will not commit illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; And then (the Prophet) recited the whole Verse (i.e. 60:12). The Prophet added, &#8216;And whoever among you fulfills his pledge, his reward is with Allah; and whoever commits something of such sins and receives the legal punishment for it, that will be considered as the expiation for that sin, and whoever commits something of such sins and Allah screens him, it is up to Allah whether to excuse or punish him.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 776:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah Apostle said in Hajjat-al-Wada, &#8220;Which month (of the year) do you think is most sacred?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;This current month of ours (the month of Dhull-Hijja).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town (country) do you think is the most sacred?&#8221; They said, &#8220;This city of ours (Mecca).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which day do you think is the most sacred?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;This day of ours.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Allah, the Blessed, the Supreme, has made your blood, your property and your honor as sacred as this day of yours in this town of yours, in this month of yours (and such protection cannot be slighted) except rightfully.&#8221; He then said thrice, &#8220;Have I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message (to you)?&#8221; The people answered him each time saying, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to you (or, woe on you)!

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 777:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet was given an option between two things, he used to select the easier of the tow as long as it was not sinful; but if it was sinful, he would remain far from it. By Allah, he never took revenge for himself concerning any matter that was presented to him, but when Allah&#8217;s Limits were transgressed, he would take revenge for Allah&#8217;s Sake.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 778:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Usama approached the Prophet on behalf of a woman (who had committed theft). The Prophet said, &#8220;The people before you were destroyed because they used to inflict the legal punishments on the poor and forgive the rich. By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! If Fatima (the daughter of the Prophet ) did that (i.e. stole), I would cut off her hand.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 81, Number 779:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish people became very worried about the Makhzumiya lady who had committed theft. They said, &#8220;Nobody can speak (in favor of the lady) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and nobody dares do that except Usama who is the favorite of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8221; When Usama spoke to Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that matter, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do you intercede (with me) to violate one of the legal punishment of Allah?&#8221; Then he got up and addressed the people, saying, &#8220;O people! The nations before you went astray because if a noble person committed theft, they used to leave him, but if a weak person among them committed theft, they used to inflict the legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad committed theft, Muhammad will cut off her hand.!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaykh, I hope for from you—may Allaah grant you Tawfeeq, and may He benefit me and those listening—and answer to my question; rather, my problem which affects me in my life and my worship; and I fear that it will separate me from my religion. So I want from you a remedy which will heal me and other than myself from the youth; specifically since we are nearing this blessed month. The problem is the secret habit; what is its ruling? Does it make Ghusl obligatory? Does it affect the prayer, fasting, and (other acts of) worship? Open for us a door by way of which we can exit; may Allaah open for you and the listeners the eight doors of paradise.</span></p>

Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="color:#000000;">[56] Question:</b><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on masturbation?</span></span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><b style="color:#000000;">Answer: </b><span style="color:#000000;">We have no doubts regarding the forbiddance of such a practice. And this is due to two reasons, the first of which is the saying of Allaah, the Most High, concerning the description of the believers: </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#008000;">“Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their prayer with full submissiveness. And those who turn away from false and vain talk. And those who pay the Zakaah. And those who guard their chastity – Except with their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, for (in that) they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 1-8] </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee used this ayah as proof for the forbiddance of masturbating. This is since, in this ayah, Allaah has placed two ways for the true believers to fulfill their desires &#8211; either by marrying free women or by enjoying the slave women and female war captives. Then He says: </span><b style="color:#000000;">”But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors”</b><span style="color:#000000;"> meaning: Whoever desires a way by which to transmit his desires, apart from these two ways of marriage and taking female war captives, then he is a transgressor and a wrongdoer. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">As for the second reason, then it has been medically established that there are unhealthy consequences for the one who does such an act, and that there are harms to the health caused by this practice, especially for those who constantly engage in it day and night. It is reported on the Prophet (</span><i style="color:#000000;">sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i><span style="color:#000000;">) that he said: </span><b style="color:#000000;">”Do not harm and do not be harmed.”</b><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus it is not permissible for a Muslim to engage in anything that will cause harm to himself or to others.</span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">There is one more thing that must be mentioned and it is that those who engage themselves in this practice fall under the statement of Allaah: </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><b style="color:#000000;">“Will you exchange that which is lower for that which is better?”</b><span style="color:#000000;"> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 61] </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Also there has been reported on the Prophet (</span><i style="color:#000000;">sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i><span style="color:#000000;">) that which further confirms this forbiddance and it is his saying: </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you group of young men! Whoever amongst you is able to marry then let him marry, for indeed it is the best means for lowering one&#8217;s gaze and the best way to protect one&#8217;s private parts. And whosoever is not able, then let him fast, for indeed it will be a shield for him.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Dream of the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: [<small>Interpretation of Dreams ]</small> : <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Narrated Samura bin Jundub</span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>“Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).” I think the Prophet said, “In that oven there was much noise and voices.” The Prophet added, “We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “…. red like blood.” The Prophet added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these (two) persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Go up and I went up’ The Prophet added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me, ‘This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, ‘That (palace) is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day)</p>
<p>I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’<br />
They replied, ‘We will inform you:</p>
<p>As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers.</p>
<p>As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And</p>
<p>those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;,</p>
<p>and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and</p>
<p>the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and</p>
<p>the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).”</p>
<p>The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, “O Allah’s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?” The Prophet replied, “And also the children of pagans.”</p>
<p>The Prophet added, “My two companions added,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p>‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: <b>&#8220;My entire nation is safe, except al-Mujahirin</b> (those who boast of their sins). <b>Among the Mujaharah is that a man commits an (evil) act, and wakes up in the morning while Allah has kept his (sin) a secret, he says: &#8220;O Fulan! Last night I did this and that.&#8221; He goes to sleep while Allah has kept his (sin) a secret but he wakes up in the morning and uncovers what Allah has kept a secret!&#8221;</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah Ibn Masoud (radiyallahu anhu) related, &#8216;A man came to the Prophet and said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! I have mingled with a woman in the far side of al-Medina, and I fulfilled my desire short of actually having sexual intercourse with her. So, here am I, judge me according to what you decide.&#8217; Umar Ibn al-Khattab (radiyallahu anhu) then said: <b>&#8216;Allah had kept your secret, why did not you keep your secret?&#8217; </b>[Sharh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (salallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;<b>He, who relieves a hardship of this Dunya (word) for a believer, Allah will relieve (from him) a hardship of the Day of Resurrection; he who makes easy an indebted person, Allah will make it easy for him in the Dunya and the Hereafter; he who covers a Muslim </b>(meaning his mistakes and shortcomings), <b>Allah will cover him in the Dunya and the Hereafter…&#8221;</b>[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah Ibn Umar (radiyallahu anhu) related, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (salallahu alaihe wa-sallam) once rose above the podium and then said with a loud voice,<b>&#8220;O those who have embraced Islam only with their tongue, while Eemaan has not yet entered their hears, neither harm Muslims, nor mock them, nor try to expose their mistakes, for he who follows</b>(searches for) <b>the errors of his brother, Allah will follow his errors, and he whom Allah follows his errors, He will expose him even if he was in the middle of his home.&#8221; </b>[Saheeh al-Jamee]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah &#8216;Ateeq al-Harbee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah &#8216;Ateeq al-Harbee is one of the professors in the University of al-Madeenah, he is a student of Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh began by giving his salutation after sending peace and blessings upon the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) and after praising Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: O Muslims indeed Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created us and He has not left us to our own desires. Indeed He has prohibited us and He has given us command and He has made it clear to us the path of khair and the path of good and He has encouraged us to follow that. And He has made clear to us the path of evil and has prohibited us from following that. And indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala is more knowledgeable concerning that which is good and that which has the best for His servant in this life and the Hereafter. And He is the Most Knowledgeable concerning that which will give them bliss and that which will give them good fortune in this life and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed from the things that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has made it important and placed importance upon<br />
protecting it and upon making sure that the Muslims are mindful with regards to it and that He has prohibited us and made us something that we should be distant from corrupting and that is the honour of the Muslim and that is going to be the title of the talk. And indeed it has been established in a hadith in Saheeh al-Bukhari that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said : &#8216;indeed your blood, and your wealth and your honour, is haraam upon you (it is prohibited upon you) just as this day is haram or considered sacrilegious and just as this month is considered sacrilegious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed the honour is something that should be protected by the Muslims in two ways :</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>As for the first way, that which is apparent from the honour of the Muslims : and that is by clothing it using the<br />
garments that the Shariah has laid down and prescribed and what the Messenger has prescribed (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).</li>
<li>And as for the second type is that which is hidden from the honour : and that is to protect it from zina and to protect it from homosexuality and those types of affairs.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said : &#8216;O you who believe, indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has sent down upon you a garment that will cover your modesty and He has given you a leash which is something other than from the standard covering. And indeed from the greatest of things that will make the honour of the Muslim corrupt whether they are male or whether they are female and indeed it is that which is referred to or known as &#8216;zina.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;.. and do not come close to zina. Indeed it is something that is lewd and it is an evil way.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed in this ayah Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has made Haraam anything that leads to zina and that is never mind the actual committing of the act. Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216; and do not come close to fawahish, do not come close to lewdness, that which is apparent from it and that which is hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed the issue of fornication (may Allaah protect us all from it). Indeed along with it being prohibited it is something that likewise corrupts the society, corrupts the community. And indeed it is from the reasons for the spreading of corruption in and amongst the community.&#8217; Insha-Allaah I am going to mentions some of the reasons and some of the things that corrupts the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the first of the evils that come from zina is that it is one of the causes for the spread of many evils and many diseases connected to fornication, just like the sickness of AIDS and other in that from the sicknesses that destroy the lands and destroy the servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise it is from the reasons that causes commotion in and amongst the family &#8212; as far as it relates to the husband or as far as it relates to the wife and to the children and if the family indeed is split, that will lead to the splitting of the community and indeed they will fall into that which are of the lowly actions and will fall into corruptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the evil effects of zina is that it is from the reason for talaaq (or divorce) being plentiful in the societies. Because you find after the marriage, after a small space of time you will find the people divorcing each other and sometimes this happens after a space of few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that it lowers the marriage rates in the society. So as for the person who commits fornication and is constant and regular in doing that, then he does not look to marriage except as another way of having a sexual relationship. Not that it is a beautiful way of uniting two bodies, neither it is a life that is built of love and emotions and raising a family and having children and indeed from bringing and having children, it is by way of those children our that lives become happy lives. And likewise it makes life easy with the presence of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise we see from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that we find the level of children and the level of having kids fall in that particular society. Because when zina is one of the reasons for the spread of deadly diseases like AIDS and other than AIDS, we find as a result of that many people die in the society. And as a result of that we find people having children as a result of that die. And as a result of that also the strength of the community is lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also from the evil effects of zina, is that it leads to much crime in that society. And from that the crimes that generate and likewise a person will enter into stealing and rape in order to satisfy his sexual desires. And likewise as a result of that we find people even killing each other and killing themselves as a result of this spread of this zina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the evil effects of zina, is that we find that we have many children, many offspring that are the children that have come as a result of that fornication. And this likewise is from the sins meaning these children have come about as a product of fornication. This is also from the sins that increases crimes, and increases evil doings in and among society. Because the child from a young age is in need of receiving the love and attention from both his parents. So when the child loses out on that care and loses out on that attention, and when he loses that love, then what happens is that he has a reactory feeling as he grows that he was not nurtured upon love and upon affection. So that breeds from him and lead him to haste and dislike to society and the surrounding that he lives in. So, when he reaches the age of maturity, we find that these individuals enough of time end up themselves being individuals that commit evil acts and committing different crimes in order to avenge that society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And brothers and sisters from the things that we can utilize to protect this evil, to protect ourselves from this evil is by following the message, and the measures and the means that al-Islam has laid down for us. The means have been laid down for protecting our &#8216;ird &#8212; lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the most important means for protecting the limits is the establishment of the belief of Allaah in the hearts of the servant. So if the slave then knows and believes that Allaah is the Creator of the creation, and He is the One that is worshipped and there is none worthy of worship other than Him, then he would carry out his commands and he would stay away from his prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he will believe in his heart that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala knows the hidden things and knows those things which are apparent. And likewise he will know that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala sees everything that takes place in this creation. And so this Imaan of his will carry him to be odd and over keeping in mind the presence of Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. And it will lead him likewise, to be distant from disobeying Allaah and it will make him to carry out Allah&#8217;s commands and the things that please Allaah. So not once will Allaah see him in a place where Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala dislikes to see him in and likewise he will not be absent from places that Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala loves for him to be in. And that is a condition with the mu&#8217;min and the believer who is sincere with his Imaan, the one who is certain concerning his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Listen O brother and listen O sister, to the story of that great Sahabah ; that Sahabi who before Islaam used to commit sins as of fornication and he used to visit prostitutes ; look at his condition after his Islaam. Did he continue upon that which he was upon, in his days of Jaahiliyah before Islaam? .. (not clear) &#8230;. And likewise he took upon himself chastity and distanced himself form all evil and all lowly acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This appears in the Sunnan of Tirmidhi that a person from amongst the Sahaba (radiallahu anhu) who was referred to as al-Martad. He used to carry the prisoners of war from Makkah until he reached Medina and there was a woman from amongst the Mushrikeen who was a prostitute or she was a fornicator and her name was &#8216;Anaaq and she was his girlfriend before Islaam. And he had promised a man from amongst the prisoners of war from the people of Makkah that he was carrying. He said to them radiallaahu &#8216;I continued until I came to a wall from the walls of Makkah in the shade of a wall on the full moon night man, so &#8216;Anaaq (this woman) came to him and she had noticed that this man being detained near the wall. So when she came to me she realized that it was me. So I said, &#8216;my name is Martad&#8217; and she said, &#8216;welcome.&#8217; She then said, &#8216;come and sleep with me tonight.&#8217; So she was calling him to the lewdness. So I said, &#8216;O Anaaq, indeed Allaah has made zina Haraam. Allaahu Akbar!&#8217;. So the Shaykh is saying look then brother Muslim may Allaah guide you and myself to success. Look at the Imaan that Martad had concerning Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and how it prevented him from committing zina even though it was easy for him to commit that act. So may Allaah have mercy upon him and be pleased with him. Look how his complete turn around came for him after he was a committer of major sins and major evil deeds prior to his Islaam? Look how Islaam turned the whole direction of his life. And he became the best of the people as regards to him being chaste, as regards to him having adab, and with regards to him having taqwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore from the first of the things that we can utilize to protect ourselves from this sick disease, it is to have Imaan in Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second affair is that we make sincere tawbah to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala for all of our sins. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;and those who when they commit a sin or when they run themselves, they remember Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and make isthighfar for their sins. And who will forgive sins other than Allaah as long as they do not persist upon that which they did while they know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise from the things that will protect ourselves and from the methods and means that have been laid down in the Shariah is that indeed Islaam is the deen of the fitrah and its way is the just way, balanced way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has affirmed for mankind that which he has established or that which he has within him a way of desire for sexual actions. But Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has not made it absolute for him to utilize or enjoy his desire in any way that he pleases. And at the same time He has not prohibited him from enjoying sexual pleasures absolutely but rather it has reigns and orders for him that desire of his. And that sis with the connection of the link of marriage. Because when Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala created mankind, He created for him his wife so that he may receive tranquility from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says, &#8216;and indeed from His signs is that He has created for you wives so that you may<br />
receive tranquility and reside with them. And He has made between you love and He has made between you Mercy.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Allaah has made and prescribed marriage by way or which a person can increase in love and emotional feelings. And a way for him to protect himself from falling into evil deeds and lewd deeds. And for that reason Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) encouraged that we should marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In both Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8216;O gathering of youth, whosoever from amongst you is able then let him marry. Because it is better for the lowering of the gaze. And it is better as a protection of the private parts. And whosoever is not able to do so then let him fast, because then indeed it is a protection for him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the things that protect ones private parts (and things connected to that), that the method of protecting &#8212; &#8211; that men not mix with the women. Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah mentions in his book, &#8216;and there is no doubt that to let the women mix with the men is the origin of every evil. And it is from the greatest reasons for Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala revealing or sending upon the people punishments and likewise it is from the reason that the general and the specific affairs become corrupt. And the men mixing with the women is a reason for zina, fawahisha, lewdness and evil act connected to sexual related acts being committed between men and women. And it is from the reasons for diseases and plagues when the prostitutes began to mix with the army of Musa, and evil deeds and lewdness began to spread among them. Indeed Allaah sent upon them at that point plague and diseases and 70,000 people died as a result of that. And we ask Allaah that He protects us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the protective reasons that has been laid down by the Shariah for the male Muslim and the female Muslim, that the women wear the hijaab and screen themselves from strange men. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says, &#8216;..and stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of the days of Jaahiliyah&#8217; and Allaah azzawajal says addressing his message to his Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : &#8216;O Messenger, say to your wives, daughters and to the women from amongst the Muslimeen, that they should throw the jilbaabs over themselves, that is better for them not to be known or not to be recognized and they will not be harmed. And indeed Allaah is al- Ghaffoor ar-Raheem.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons is that a woman stays in her home and that she doesn&#8217;t leave her home except for a<br />
pressing need. Allaah says in the previous ayah, &#8216;.. stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of jaahiliyah. And you know O servants of Allaah, (O female slave of Allaah) that the Shaitaan who is the major enemy for us utilizes the issue of the women leaving out of their homes, using her as a means of corrupting the men and utilizing the men for corrupting her. And indeed the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) has said, &#8216;indeed the whole of the woman is an awrah. So if she leaves her home, then indeed the shaitaan beautifies her and makes her fall into some type of fitnah and attempts her to fall into some lowly deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from that a person distances himself from music as it is established with the people who have intellect that the beautiful voice has a direct effect upon the heart especially the heart of the woman. Music has an effect more on the woman than it has on the men. And if that music is accompanied with singing and with the playing of musical instruments, the effect that it has on the hearts in calling that person to lewdness is indeed greater. And for that reason Fudayl Ibn Iyyad rahimahullah mentioned that music is the ruqya of zina &#8211; meaning it is the thing that will lead towards it and will draw towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says in the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8216;and indeed from the people of those who buy lahwal hadeed (meaning music here) in order to misguide from the path of Allaah and Ibn Masood radiallaahu anhu swore three times by Allaah regarding the tafseer concerning this ayah and the explanation of the lahwal hadeed that it is ghina, it is music and likewise from the reasons that protect ourselves from this lewdness will be mentioned in a summarized form so that we don&#8217;t spend too long here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them the Shaykh mentions is that a person both men and women lowers their gazes. Because the sight that it takes to look is from the arrows <strong>from the arrows of Iblees</strong>. And for that reason the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained, &#8216;that the first look that you take for a woman is for you i.e it is overlooked and the second one is against you. And that is because the first look that a person took was not intentional i.e he did not intentionally take that look of that woman. So Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala had mercy upon us and forgave us for that. And as for the second look then the mu&#8217;min the male and the female believer are both taken to account for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the woman should not perfume herself when she leaves from her house. Indeed Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) prohibited that. And likewise from the reasons that will protect the society from this is that a woman does not show her beautification or that which she wears underneath her jilbaab except to those individuals who are from her mahrim (Mahram) who are lawful from her relatives.Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said that she should not show anything of her beautification except that which is<br />
apparent from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons that will protect us bi-iznillaah that a woman does not enter in her speech i.e she does not go into too much depth with her speech and that she does not soften her speech to strange men. Whether that is upon the telephone or upon other than the telephone. And this is indeed from the greatest of reasons that leads to that evil. Because indeed if she is soft in her speech, then that one who has something from sickness from his heart , will enter into his heart to have something with her by way of evil actions or by way of adultery or fornication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the reasons that we can protect, is that a person distances himself from intoxicants. Because indeed the khamr and the intoxicant are the mother of all evils. And by way a person would fall into zina and likewise it is a stealing and likewise it is a killing these souls that have been prohibited for us to kill. Rather a person would fall into every type of lowly act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from the things that will protect us is that we keep clear from touching in any way a strange woman except in extreme necessity. O Servants of Allaah, indeed when the believer believes in Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala there is no doubt that he is going to be tested and that he is going to be under trial. And for that reason Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala when he created the Jannah, He surrounded it with the distasteful things. It was surrounded by things that are distasteful like Jihaad because a person may possibly die and it is something that is difficult for a person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he wakes up at night at the time that it is very cold, and that you make wudhu and you pray. As for the tareeq or path to the Hellfire may Allaah protect us and you from it, is something that is easy iyaazu billaah. By doing those things that have connections with our desires like zina and drinking khamr and consuming wealth unlawfully and other than that from the evil act. Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;Alif Laam Meem, do the people believe that they are going to be left alone saying that we believe and that they will not be put under trial. Indeed we put to trial those who came before them and Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala will know those who were truthful in their Imaan and Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will know by way of those that who are liars &amp;ndash; the kaazibeen.nd likewise Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has said, &#8216;do you believe that you are going to enter Jannah and it did not come to you that which came to those who came before you? They were struck with hardships and calamities and they were shook until the Messenger and those who believe along with him said, &#8216;when is the aid of Allaah going to come? Indeed the aid of Allaah is near.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you O my brother Muslim, and you O my sister Muslimah indeed you have chosen al-Islaam as your religion and this is the way of the anbiya alaihissalaatu wassalam and it is upon you that you remain firm upon the religion of Allaah and that you are not shaken in your Imaan and that you are not deceived by the duny and by its beautification and by Allaah you don&#8217;t know when you are going to die. And you don&#8217;t know when that thing that thing that stops all of one&#8217;s desires and stops all of one&#8217;s pain is going to end and going to come, so die while you are upon Islaam and while you are upon Imaan and while being in a state of being distant from the lewd deed and the evil deeds. &#8216;O Allaah make us to see the Haqq and bless us to follow it. O Allaah make us see the baathil and the falsehood and bless us to stay away from it. And do not make it something that is not clear to us, so that we go astray. O Allaah make the best of our deeds of the dunya the last of our deeds, and the best of our action the last of our actions and the last of our days the day that we meet you.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Khutbatul Haajah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say, O My Servant, those who have been excessive, those who have been extreme o*n their own soul, do not despair of the mercy of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala for surely Allaah forgives all sins. And surely Allaah, He is Al-Ghaffoor and Ar-Raheem. He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Merciful. He is extremely forgiving and extremely merciful.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this above Ayah, respected brothers and sisters in Islaam, Allaah among other things explains to us that He forgives our sins. He forgives all sins, whether they are Major or Minor. No matter what colour the sin may be, no matter what size the sin may be, how old or new it is, Allaah subhana is Al-Ghaffoor Ar-Raheem. And if the Muslim, the Abd (the Slave of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) fulfills the conditions, Allaah will forgive. This type of forgiveness is a unique forgiveness. Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala is unique as He says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Qul Huw-Allaahu Ahad&#8221; &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say, He Allaah is unique.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For His forgiveness is not like any type of forgiveness and His Mercy is not like any type of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wa laisa kamislihi shaiun wa huwas Sameeul Baseer&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing like Him and He is As-Sameeh and Al-Baseer , He is the Hearer and He is the Seer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Jumma&#8217;ah we would like to talk about the methodology or the road that we can use, the way, the method that we can utilize in gaining the atonement and forgiveness of our sins. How we can gain the atonement, the expiation, the effacing, the erasing of our sins. What is the methodology of erasing these sins? What can we do to remove these sins? Because all of us are sinners as Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said in an authentic Hadith :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All of the children of Aadam are sinners and the best of sinners are those who repent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we need to learn brothers and sisters in Islaam how we can efface, how we can remove, how we can make atonement for az-zunoob; How we can get rid of these sins. When we talk about the erasing and the atonement of sins according to the ahlul Ilm, according to the people of knowledge, there are two types (two ways to remove the sins) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>One as Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala mentions :</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Follow up a bad deed with a good deed and it will wipe it out. It will erase it. This is the first type of removing (the erasing) of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is the exchange of one thing for another. As Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For them, those individuals who do these sins, Allaah will exchange for their bad deeds, good deeds. He will replace their bad deeds with good deeds and Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala is Ghaffoorur Raheema. He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many ways brothers and sisters and we can have many Khutba&#8217;as o*n this subject. But we would just like to site just a few of these ways that we can atone for and erase our sins. The first and foremost and Allaah subhana &#8216;alam, Allaah the Majestic, the Most High above all creation knows best is to accept Islaam. Alhamdulillaah, which we have all done. If a Kaafir from among the Kuffaar (no matter how good they may seem or how righteous they may seem in the eyes of the people), if they want to have their sins erased, (their tawbah is different from our tawbah) their tawbah is to accept Islaam. And there is no tawbah for them except this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala says : </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely the Deen with Allaah is not Christianity, it is not Judaism, it is not Hinduism, it is Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And again Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever seeks a Deen other than Islaam, it will never ever be accepted from him. And in the Last Day they will be the losers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those individuals who are among the Kuffar of this life, in order for their actions to be accepted and in order for them to be forgiven, they have to accept Islaam. And Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say to the Kuffar if they seize (stop) what they did in the past, they will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does that mean? It means that if they leave off their kufr, if they stop disbelieving, then Allaah will forgive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the person who wants to have the forgiveness of Allaah, that is still among the groups of the Ahlul Kitaab and the Mushrikoon, they have to accept Islaam. And Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala will remove their sins and He will forgive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those individuals whom Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala had raised among the Sahaaba to accept Islaam when the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) was alive, there is a clear, clear record of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Shumaasa al Mahri that he said : We went to Amr Ibn Al-Aas (radiallaahu anhu), he was about to die, (he was o*n his death bed). He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. (Not clear) The audience asked Amr : Didn&#8217;t the Messenger of Allaah not give you tidings of this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He turned his face towards the audience and said : The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that there is nothing worthy of worship except Allaah and Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam)is the Messenger of Allaah. For surely I have passed through three stages and this is what Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala says in His Glorious Book :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>You shall certainly travel from stage to stage.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within the first stage in which I found myself averse (disinclined) to none else more than I was averse to the Messenger of Allaah and there was no other desire stronger in my heart than the o*ne that I should over power him and kill him. Had I died in this stage, I would have been definitely been among the people of the Hell-Fire.<br />
Because if a Kaafir dies without having accepted Islaam (this is the forgiveness and atonement of his sins), he will surely go to the Hell-fire as the Prophet&#8217;s example when visiting the young Jewish boy (who used to serve him), when he went to his house and invited him to Islaam while he was o*n his death-bed and his father standing at his side, the Prophet incited him to say: &#8220;Laa ilaaha illallaah&#8221;. And he turned and looked at his father for approval. And his father said : Obey, Abu Qassim. (The Kunya, the nickname of Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam). So, the boy said : &#8220;Ash-hadu an Laailaaha illallaah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadar Rasoolullaah.&#8221; Then he died.<br />
Then the Messenger of Allaah left the house saying : Praise be to Allaah who saved this boy because of me from the Hell-Fire. So this is another proof that those individuals who do not accept Islaam and do not make this statement will be in the Hell-Fire. And those who do, Allaah will forgive them of their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said if he had died in that state, he would have been one of the inhabitants of the Hell-Fire. When Allaah instilled the love of Islaam in my heart, I came to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and I said : Stretch out your right hand O Messenger of Allaah so that I may make bai&#8217;aah (the pledge of allegiance) to you. He stretched out his right hand and I withdrew my hand. And he, the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said : What has happened to you O Amr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied : I intend to lay down some conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) asked : What conditions do you intend to put forward?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : I should be granted forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam)said : &#8220;Are you not aware of the fact that Islaam wipes out all previous sins? Verily Hijrah wipes out all previous sins. And truly Hajj wipes out all previous sins.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then he (radiallahu anhu) said : &#8220;No one was more dear to me than the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and none was more sublimer in my eyes than him. And I could never get up the courage to catch a full glimpse of his face due to its splendor. So if I am asked to describe the features of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), I am not able to do it because I have not looked at him fully. Had I died in this state, I have no reason to hope that I would ever be among the dwellers of the Paradise . I had every reason to hope that I would be among the people of Paradise.&#8221;<br />
Then we are responsible for certain things in the light of which I am not able to know what is in store for me. When I die, let not the female mourner nor the fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave well with earth and stand around it for a time in which a camel is slaughtered and the meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy (those individuals who stand around my grave) and I can ascertain what else I can give to the Angels of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of those things that will efface and atone for sins is following the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam). And we all know brothers and sisters that following the Messenger of Allaah is an incumbent act upon every male and female Muslim. Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered on, who believes in Allaah and His word and follow him so that perhaps you will gain success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also know that upon us it is the duty to obey the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam). And whoever obeys the Messenger has therefore obeyed Allaah. And it is incumbent upon every single Muslim to obey the Messenger of Allaah and obey those who are trusted in authority from the Messenger of Allaah among the Ulema.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O You who believe obey Allaah and obey His Messenger and those trusted in authority from among you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With all of this and other ahyahs and hadiths, we gain the understanding that if we believe in Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and if we follow the Messenger of Allaah, Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala will forgive us our sins simply for obeying and following the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say, if you love Allaah, then follow me.&#8221; &#8211; Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) is saying this from the Book of Allaah. He is commanding to all of us sitting here and all the Muslims until the Day of Resurrection : &#8220;if you really love Allaah, then follow me. And Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.&#8221;<br />
So in following the Prophet (just simply following him) with all the conditions of following him, if they are met, Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala will forgive our sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Taubah is a means of erasing sins, brothers and sisters. When we commit any sin, Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has instructed us in the Qura&#8217;an :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O You who believe return to Allaah with sincere, unadulterated repentance. Perhaps your Lord will atone for you, your evil deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam)in an authentic narration collected by Imaam Ibn Maajah and others on the authority of Abdullaah Ibn Al-Masood (radiallahu anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The person who repents from his sins is like the individual who didn&#8217;t have any sins at all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also following up those evil things with good things. Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has mentioned in the Qura&#8217;an :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily the good deeds remove the evil deeds. This is a reminder for those who remember.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we look at the tafseer of this particular ayah brothers and sisters, we find a very beautiful story. That a man came to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) saying : &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, I kissed a woman.&#8221;<br />
(Is there anything wrong in kissing a woman? Of course if she is not your mother, if she is not your sister, if she is not your wife and if she is not your daughter or your maternal or paternal aunt, this this haraam).<br />
And the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) answered him by reciting this verse :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Truly the good deeds remove the evil deeds and this is a reminder for the mindful.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also spreading the salaam, saying : &#8220;Assalamu alaykum&#8221; is a means of forgiveness for sins. Just simply saying, &#8220;Assalamu alaykum&#8221; you could be removed of your sins. And good speech is a means of removal of sins. And there is a Hadith that was collected in the Musnaad of Shia&#8217;ab that says that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Truly some of the causes of forgiveness is the spreading of Salaams and good speech.&#8221;<br />
(Not bad speech, but good speech. Just speaking good can remove and atone sins.)<br />
Another means of forgiveness and atonement of sins is simply shaking the hands of your brothers and sisters in Islaam. The Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are no two Muslims that meet each other, then they shake hands except that the both of them are forgiven of their sins before they leave each other.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Simple !! Just shake your brother&#8217;s hand. And hold it and keep holding it so that sins can be removed. And the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) again said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Truly the believer when he meets the other believer and then he says, &#8220;Assalamu Alaikum&#8221; and then he takes his hand and shakes his hand, both of their sins fall off like leaves fall from trees.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar !!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the man who shakes the hand of a woman he should not be shaking, like his boss from a job or a woman that he grew up with or a sister shaking the hand of a man that is not her husband or her father, Ayesha (Radialllaahu anha) said as reported in Sahih Bukhari : That the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) never, ever, ever, touched the hand of a woman that he didn&#8217;t possess.&#8221; NEVER.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration submitted by at-Tabarani, the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It would be better for a man to be struck in his hand with an iron spike than to touch a woman that is not lawful for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Alhamdulillaahi Rabbil Aalameen !!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another means brothers and sisters for the forgiveness of sins is the example that we have in the collection of al-Bukhari, Muslim and Abu-Dawuud i.e to be kind and gentle and generous to animals. Feeding the birds, feeding dogs, giving water to a dog, feeding Harry the cat that is outside. All of these things with good treatment to animals can be a means for the atonement of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam)said: &#8220;While a man was walking on the road, he was overcome due to the extremity of the heat became extremely thirsty. Then he found a well. So he descended the well and drank from it. And as he was coming out, he saw a dog that was panting from the heat, eating the dirt from the ground because of extreme thirst. Then the man said, &#8220;the dog had come and was very thirsty and the thirst had reached a height greater than the thirst I had.&#8221; So he went back into the well and he filled his socks and he got hold of the mouth of the dog and he poured the water into the mouth of the dog. The dog&#8217;s thirst was quenched and Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala after giving thanks to him forgave him of his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those individuals in this Masjid that are feeding Harry outside, Alhamdulillaah, may Allaah forgive you of your sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for those things among the taharah of the salaah, we know in conclusion brothers and sisters that al-wudhoo is a means of removal of sins. From Uthman Ibn Affan (Radiallaahu anhu)said that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said that : &#8220;whoever makes wudhoo and makes it well according to the Qura&#8217;an and the authenticated Sunnah, paying attention to all the spots on their body that they are supposed to wash, making sure that every spot is touched with water, not using very little and not using too much, (being moderate between the two), remembering Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala while he is making the wudhoo, and then leaving that wudhoo, Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala will remove his sins from his entire body so much so that the sins will be removed from even beneath your fingernails.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And again, Abu Huraira (Radiallaahu anhu) said that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said : &#8220;When a slave, a Mu&#8217;min or a Muslim washes his face in the course of ablution, every single sin that he contemplated with his eyes will be washed away from his face along with the water or with the last drop of water. When he washes his hands, every single sin that he committed with his hand will be erased from his hand with the water or with the last drop of water. And when he washes his feet, every sin towards with which his feet has walked will be washed away with the water or with the last drop of the water. The result is that he comes out pure, completely pure from every single sin.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this once again brothers and sisters in conclusion, is onLY for the person who performs the wudhoo correctly. Not for those individuals who splash water on themselves and who are unmindful of the rudiments or principles of wudhoo.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="font-size:11px;line-height:1.5em;">It was a khutbah given by him on the 12th of Muharram 1411AH which was published in Arabic and translated to English by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, in whose Hand is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Sovereignty is His, all praise is for Him, and He is a witness of everything. All His prescribed laws and what He has decreed are from His Wisdom. He does whatever He wills and commands whatever He wishes. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone, having no partner, the Guardian, the One Worthy of all Praise. I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the last of the prophets and their leader and the best of worshippers; may Allaah extol and send complete peace upon his family, his Companions and those who follow them in goodness till the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, explaining His complete Power, and perfect Wisdom, that what He alone orders is what happens, and that He is the one governing and controlling His servants &#8211; granting security, fear, ease, hardship, facility, difficulty, straightened circumstances and prosperity&#8230; Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ هُوَ فِي شَأْنٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth begs of Him. Every day He has a matter to bring forth</i></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i> (such as giving honour to some, disgrace to some, life to some, death to some etc)</i></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>!&#8221;  </i></span></strong>(Soorah ar-Rahmaan (55): 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Most High, controls the affairs of His creation enforcing His rulings sometimes according to His Wisdom and Beneficence, and sometimes according to His Wisdom and Justice, and your Lord never treats anyone unjustly:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We wronged them not, but they were wrong-doers.&#8221;</span> </strong></i>(Soorah az-Zukhruf (42): 76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we believe in Allaah and His predecree (<em>Qadr</em>), and belief in Allaah&#8217;s predecree is one of the pillars of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><em>Eemaan</em> is belief in the heart, saying of the tongue and action of the limbs</strong>.) [Translator&#8217;s Note]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We believe that whatever good or state of ease and security comes upon us then it is from Allaah&#8217;s blessings upon us and it is an obligation upon us that we give praise and thanks to the One who granted and provided that for us. This is done by returning to obedience to Him, avoiding whatever He forbade and doing whatever He ordered. If we carry out our duty of obedience to Allaah then we will be giving thanks for His blessings and would then deserve the increase in these blessings which Allaah has promised us from His bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever of the blessings and good things you have, it is from Allaah</strong></span>.&#8221; </i>(Soorah an-Nahl (16):53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He, the Most High says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ ۖ وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِي لَشَدِيدٌ</span><br />
<i></i></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And </strong>(remember)<strong> when your Lord proclaimed: &#8216;If you give thanks, I will give you more </strong>(of My blessings)<strong>, but if you are thankless, verily My punishment is indeed severe.'&#8221;</strong> </span></i>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14):7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Alhamdu&#8217;Lillaah</em> (All Praise and thanks are for Allaah), we live in this land in a state of security and ease, but this state of security and ease cannot continue except through obedience to Allaah. As long as we order good and forbid evil, as long as we cooperate in ordering good and forbidding evil, since those who order good and forbid evil are at the forefront of the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation, the Muslims as a group), and they repel the causes of punishment and chastisement, so we should assist them and be with them. If they err we should inform them of their mistake and warn them about it and lead them to the guidance and not let their mistake become a reason to remove and distance them from this responsibility &#8211; that is not the correct way.<br />
<b><br />
O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993366;">Whatever harm and hardship has befallen the people in their wealth or security, individuals or societies is due to their sins and their having neglected the commands of Allaah and his prescribed laws, and their seeking judgement amongst the people by other than the prescribed laws of Allaah &#8211; who created all of creation and was more merciful to them than their mothers and fathers, and He is the One who knows better than themselves what is most beneficial for them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b><br />
<b><br />
I repeat this sentence because of its importance and because many of the people turn away from it:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>I say (meaning the Shaykh):</b> whatever harm and hardship has befallen the people in their wealth or security, individuals or societies is due to their sins and their having neglected the commands of Allaah and his prescribed laws, and their seeking judgement amongst the people by other than the prescribed laws of Allaah &#8211; who created all of creation and was more merciful to them than their mothers and fathers, and He is the One who knows better than themselves what is most beneficial for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, explaining that in His Book, so that we may realize and take warning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> </i>(Soorah ash-Shoora (42):30)</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself.&#8221; </i></span></strong>(Soorah an-Nisaa&#8217; (4):79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever good comes upon us &#8211; blessings or security &#8211; it is from Allaah, it is He who provided that, its beginning and end, from His beneficience. It is He who granted us from His bounty that we should carry out what which would lead to it, and it is He who granted us His blessings and completed that for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for whatever evil has befallen us, whether famine or fear, or whatever else causes harm, then it is due to our own selves, we are the ones who have wronged ourselves and led ourselves to destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O people:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people today attribute the misfortunes which befall them, whether relating to wealth and economics, or security and political affairs to purely materialistic causes, to political causes, economic reasons, or problems due to borders. There is no doubt that this is due to their limited understanding and weakness of their eemaan and their failure to reflect upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims, Believers in Allaah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Behind these reasons are causes prescribed as such by Allaah, reasons and causes for these misfortunes which are stronger, greater and produce a more severe effect than the material reasons. However the material reasons may be a means of bringing about what is due to the causes prescribed by Allaah which necessitates the misfortune and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي النَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُم بَعْضَ الَّذِي عَمِلُوا لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Evil </strong>(sins and disobedience of Allaah etc.)<strong> has appeared on the land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </strong>(by oppression and evil deeds etc.)<strong>, that Allaah may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </strong>(by repenting to Allaah)<strong>.&#8221; </strong></span> (</i>Soorah ar-Room (30):41)<br />
<b><br />
</b><b>O people, O Muslims, O nation of Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Give thanks for the blessings of Allaah upon you which you are about to hear of. O nation of Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم you are the best and most noble of the nations of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah does not punish this nation for its disobedience and sins in the way that He punished the previous nations. He will not cause its destruction with a single overwhelming punishment as happened to &#8216;<em>Aad</em> (See Soorah al-Haaqqah (69):6-7), when they were destroyed by the violent wind which He unleashed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so that they were left lying like the hollow trunks of palm trees &#8211; do you see any remnants of them? He will not destroy it with the like of the punishment of <em>Thamood</em> (See Soorah al-Haaqqah (69):5) who were seized by the terrible shout and the earthquake so that they lay prostrate corpses in their homes. And He will not destroy it with the like of the punishment of the people of <em>Loot</em> (See Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):80-84), against whom Allaah sent a violent wind and stones from the sky and turned their homes upside down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Muslims:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, from His Wisdom and His Mercy, punishes this nation for its sins and disobedience by setting some part of it upon the others so that they destroy one another and take each other prisoner. Allaah, the Might and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَىٰ أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابًا مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعًا وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُم بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ ۗ انظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ وَكَذَّبَ بِهِ قَوْمُكَ وَهُوَ الْحَقُّ ۚ قُل لَّسْتُ عَلَيْكُم بِوَكِيلٍ لِّكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُّسْتَقَرٌّ ۚ وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Say: &#8216;He has power to send torment on you from above you or from under your feet, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.&#8217; See how variously We explain the Ayaat, so that they may understand.</i></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i><br />
But your people </i></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>(O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم)</i></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i> have denied it </i></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>(the Qur&#8217;aan)</i></span><span style="color:#008000;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><b> though it is the Truth.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer quotes a number of ahaadeeth &#8211; (ahaadeeth, sing. hadeeth: Sayings narrated from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, regarding his words, actions or attributes) &#8211; in his Tafseer of the first aayah. From these is that reported by al-Bukhaaree from Jaabir ibn &#8216;Adbullaah (radhiyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the (following) aayah was revelaed:<br />
<i><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8216;He has power to send torment on you from above you&#8230;&#8221;</strong></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:<br />
<i><br />
<strong>&#8216;I seek refuge with Your Face.&#8217;</strong></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;&#8230;or from under your feet&#8230;&#8221;</i></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>&#8216;I seek refuge with Your Face.&#8217;</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8216;or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.&#8221;</i></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>&#8216;This is lighter&#8217; or &#8216;&#8230;easier.'&#8221;</i></strong><br />
<b><br />
</b>(Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (Eng. trans. vol 6, p.120-121 no. 152)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported by Muslim from Sa&#8217;d bin Abee Waqqaas (<em>radhiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We went along with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم until we came to the mosque of Banoo Mu&#8217;aawiyah, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم entered and prayed two rak&#8217;ahs so we prayed along with him. So he called upon his Lord for a long time, then he said:<br />
<i><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;I asked my Lord for three things: I asked Him that He should not destroy my nation with a deluge so He granted me that: I asked him that He should not destroy my nation with famine &#8211; as happened to the people of Fir&#8217;awn so He granted me that: and I asked Him that they should not fight amongst themselves &#8211; but He refused me that.&#8221;</strong></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Khabbaab ibn al-Aratt, (<em>radhiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>), who said:<br />
<i><br />
&#8220;I came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم on a night in which he spent the whole of it in prayer until it was fajr, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concluded his prayer with tasleem. I said: &#8216;O Messneger of Allaah: You have prayed a prayer this night the like of which I have not seen you pray.&#8217;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said:<br />
<i><br />
<strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8216;Indeed it was a prayer of hope and fear. In it I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for three things. He granted me two and refused me one. I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He should not destroy us with that which He destroyed the nations before us &#8211; and He granted it to me; I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He should not overwhelm us with an enemy from other than us &#8211; so He granted it to me; and I asked my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He should not cause us to divide into separate groups each attacking the others, but He refused me that.'&#8221;</span></strong></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee and at-Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>You believe in these <em>Aayaat</em> and you believe in the narrations which are authentic from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم so why will you not reflect upon them? Why will you not reflect upon them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why will you not attribute these misfortunes which occur to deficiency in your own practice of the Deen so that you turn back to your Lord and save yourselves from the causes of overwhelming destruction?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fear Allaah O servant of Allaah and look to your affairs and repent before your Lord and correct your way towards Him. Know O nation that these punishments which have come upon you and these trials that have been inflicted upon you are your own doing and due to your sins. So for each chastisement repent and turn to Allaah and seek the refuge of Allaah, the Most High, from the trials; the material trials relating to the person: killing, injury and being forced from ones home; trails relating to wealth: decrease and loss: and trails relating to the Deen (the way of life prescribed by Allaah) &#8211; the doubts and desires which assail the hearts and keep the Ummah away from the Deen of Allaah, and keep it away from the way of our Pious Predecessors (<em>Salaf</em>) and which lead it to destruction. The trials of the heart are the worst and the most severe of all the trials in this world since worldly misfortunes when they occur can only cause loss in this world, which will pass away anyway, whether sooner or later but trials relating to the Deen cause loss of this world and the Hereafter:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ إِنَّ الْخَاسِرِينَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ أَلَا ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say </strong>(O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم)<strong> : The losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, that will be a manifest loss!&#8221;</strong></span> </i>(Soorah az-Zumar (39):15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O Allaah, we ask you whilst awaiting fulfillment of one of the duties You have made obligatory upon us &#8211; that You make us of those who take heed of Your Signs and receive admonition when Your punishment descends.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, grant that the Islamic Ummah and its leaders truly turn back to You in open and in secret, in their sayings and their actions so that the Ummah is rectified, since rectitude of the rulers is a cause of the rectitude of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, we ask you that You rectify those in charge of the affairs of the Muslims and that You grant that they are able to take heed from events and that You direct them to that which You love and is pleasing to You &#8211; O Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, we ask You that you keep away from them every evil adviser &#8211; indeed You have full power over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, guide them through good advisers to that which is good &#8211; those who will advise them and encourage them in good &#8211; O Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, whoever amongst the advisers of those in authority over the Muslims is not a sincere adviser to them, and is not sincere to the people them remove them and replace them with those who are better than them &#8211; O Lord of all the worlds. O Possessor of Majesty and Nobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all the worlds, and may He extol and send peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, upon his family, true followers and all his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aameen.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Khutbah</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, many pure and blessed praises as our Lord loves and is pleased with, and I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner. All praise is for Him at the beginning and the end. I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger, the one whom He chose and took as His <em>khaleel</em>, may Allaah extol him and send peace upon him, his family, followers, Companions and those who follow in his way.<br />
<b><br />
</b>To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>O servant of Allaah! Fear Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and beware of neglecting the prescribed laws of Allaah. Beware of neglecting Allaah&#8217;s signs. Beware of failing to reflect upon the Book of Allaah. Beware of failing to know the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم &#8211; since in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم lies your success (if you cling to them if you attest to the truth of what they inform of and follow their commands) in this world and the hereafter.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Servants of Allaah&#8230;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people who doubt and seek to cause doubts that sins are a cause of misfortunes, and that is because of the weakness of their eemaan and their negligence in reflecting upon the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and I will recite for the benefit of such people the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَىٰ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَاتٍ مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِن كَذَّبُوا فَأَخَذْنَاهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ أَفَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُم بَأْسُنَا بَيَاتًا وَهُمْ نَائِمُونَ أَوَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُم بَأْسُنَا ضُحًى وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ أَفَأَمِنُوا مَكْرَ اللَّهِ ۚ فَلَا يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And if the people of the towns had believed and had taqwa </strong>(piety)<strong>, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth, but they belied </strong>(the Messengers)<strong>. So we took them </strong>(with punishment)<strong> for what they used to earn </strong>(polytheism, and crimes etc.)<strong>. Did the people of the towns them feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they are asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they play? Did they then feel secure against the plot of Allaah. None feels secure from the plot of Allaah except the people who are lost.&#8221;</strong></span> </i>(Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):96-99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>&#8220;If you see Allaah grant blessings to a certain person, and then you see that person continuing in disobedience to Him, then know that this is from Allaah&#8217;s plan against him</strong> and that he is referred to by Allaah, the most Highs, saying:</i></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em><strong>&#8220;We shall gradually seize them with punishment in ways they perceive not. And I respite them; certainly My plot is strong.&#8221; </strong></em></span>(Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):182-183)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims, O worshippers of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Allaah, sins affect the security of a land; they affect its ease; its prosperity; its economy; and they affect the hearts of its people. Sins cause alienation between the people. Sins cause one Muslim to regard his Muslim brother as if he were upon a separate religion other than Islaam.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if we sought to rectify ourselves, our families, our neighbours and those in our areas, and everyone we are able to rectify, if we mutually encouraged good and forbade evil, if we assisted those who do this with wisdom and wise admonition &#8211; then it would produce unity and harmony. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting all that is good (Islaam), enjoining the ma&#8217;roof and forbiddin the munkar. And it is those who are successful. And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.&#8221;</strong></span> </i>(Soorah Aali-&#8216;Imraan (3):104-105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[TN] <strong>Ma&#8217;roof</strong>: Tawheed (making all worship for Allaah alone) and all that Islaam orders one to do. </span><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Munkar</strong>:  Shirk (associating others with Allaah in worship), Kufr (disbelief) and all that Islaam has forbidden).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call myself and you, O my brothers, to come together upon the Deen of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; support one another in establishing the Sharee&#8217;ah of Allaah; advise each other sincerely with wisdom and wise admonition; debate with those whom we have to debate with in the best way and by satisfying them with textual proofs and intellectual proofs and do not abandon the people of false beliefs upon their falsehood since they have a right upon us that we should explain the truth to them and encourage them to follow it and that we explain what is false to them and warn against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for remaining a disunited nation having no regard for one another and not caring about the affairs of each then whoever does not care about the Muslims is not from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims, I say and repeat that it is binding upon us, being Muslims and Believers that we see the occurrences and misfortunes from the Islamic perspective as shown by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم. Since if we look at them from a materialistic perspective then the unbelievers are stronger and greater than us in the materialistic sense and they hold sway over us and enslave us through that. However, if we look from an Islamic perspective by the way of the Book and the Sunnah then we will abandon all that is a cause of these misfortunes, and if we return to Allaah and aid the Deen of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then Allaah says in His Book, and He is the most truthful in speech and most capable, He, the Mighty and Majestic:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِن مَّكَّنَّاهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا الزَّكَاةَ وَأَمَرُوا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَوْا عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۗ وَلِلَّهِ عَاقِبَةُ الْأُمُورِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order the establishment of prayer and the payment of Zakaat (the obligatory charity), and they enjoin the ma&#8217;roof and forbid the munkar. And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of the creatures).&#8221;</span></strong> </i>(Soorah al-Hajj (22):40-41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say &#8220;those whom if We give them power in the earth establish arenas of sin, idle, frivolity and shamelessness&#8221; rather he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order the establishment of prayer and the payment of Zakaat (the obligatory charity), and they enjoin the ma&#8217;roof and forbid the munkar. And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of the creatures).</strong>&#8220;&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider carefully, O Muslim brother, how Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty</strong></span>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stressed this promise of help with terms of emphasis: an implicit oath, the letter laam of emphasis, and the noon of emphasis. He further emphasized it by His saying:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><i>&#8220;Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.&#8221;</i></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since by His Power and His Might He helps those whom He wills, and consider how He ended the two Aayahs with His saying:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ عَاقِبَةُ الْأُمُورِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of the creatures).&#8221;</strong></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person may say due to his faulty thinking: &#8220;<strong>how can we be aided and granted victory against the unbelieving nations which are stronger and more powerful than us</strong>.&#8221; So Allaah, the Most High, explains that the affairs are under His control only and that He has power over everything. We all know what affect earthquakes have &#8211; occurring when Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has ordered:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">كُن فَيَكُونُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i><b>&#8220;Be! and it is.&#8221; </b></i></span>(Soorah an-Nahl (16):40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; and such huge and embracing destruction occurs in a single second as cannot be produced by the strongest of these nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Allaah, if we truly aided Allaah&#8217;s Deen as we aught to then we would be granted victory over every enemy upon the earth, but unfortunately many of us are appendages of the enemies of Allaah and the enemies of His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم &#8211; observing their actions against Allaah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم then following them in that. Perhaps even going to their lands and tossing our flesh and blood &#8211; sons and daughters &#8211; into those lands where nothing heard but church bells&#8230; where in no <em>adhaan</em> (call to prayer) is heard&#8230; no mention of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, is heard&#8230; and nothing is seen except sin and idle frivolity&#8230;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>So we ask Allaah, the Most High, that He turns the misguided of this Ummah back to the guidance, and that He makes us all to support one another and aid one another in carrying out good and righteousness until we return to this Ummah its lost glory and honour. Indeed He is one fully able and having this power to do that.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O Allaah accept from us (our righteous deeds). Indeed You are the one who hears and knows everything.</strong><b><br />
O Allaah accept from us (our righteous deeds). Indeed You are the one who hears and knows everything.<br />
</b><b>O Allaah accept from us (our righteous deeds). Indeed You are the one who hears and knows everything.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O Allaah, extol Muhammad and his true followers and family as You extolled Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Indeed You are worthy of all praise, the most noble.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon his true followers and family as You are Worthy of all Praise, the Most Noble.</strong><b><br />
</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Man commits sins while he knows, but this is from the ignorance of man. Certainly ignorance is that which overcomes his heart the moment he practices or does actions of disobedience; then he forgets the punishment and threat of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The repentance accepted by Allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance”</span>(4:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described them with ignorance even if they were people who possessed knowledge. But the moment they began practicing evil and fell into it; the ignorance over took their hearts, and man (then) forgets about the greatness of Allaah and the completeness of His knowledge; Allaah&#8217;s acquaintance of him, and that Allaah sees him and knows his secrets. This one becomes neglectful of all of these affairs. So there is a must to give him advice, and warn him regarding the anger of Allaah; so that you establish that which is obligatory upon you in calling to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the prophet ملسو هيلع للها ىلص said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;if one of you sees an evil then let him change with hand, and if he is not able then with his tongue, and if able to; then in his heart that is the weakest of faith&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by: Yasin Abu Ibrahim<br />
Verified by: Raha Batts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What is your advice for those who have been tried with looking at pornographic photos and movies? Especially with the presence of many kinds of media which are available to everyone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Sulaymaan bin Saleemullaah ar-Ruhaylee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah! O my Lord! O Ever Living! O One who sustains and protects all that exists! O Originator of the heavens and the earth! O Allaah! Cure his heart, O Lord of all that exists! O Allaah, turn him away from this calamity, O Lord of all that exists!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My advice to myself and to my brothers, is that we should know that the eye is a blessing from Allaah. It is from the greatest blessings of Allaah upon us! A blessing that reoccurs in every moment! So we should use it to obey Allaah and we shouldn&#8217;t use it to disobey Allaah. And we have to know that the one who uses the blessings of Allaah to disobey Him, then he is on the verge of it not being a blessing anymore, even if it stays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second affair, is that we should remind ourselves that we will be asked about this eye in front of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. When you sit in your room while there is no one (with you), and you look (to these images), then remember that you will stand in front of Allaah and He will ask you about this eye and these things you were looking at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is no one among you except that his Lord will speak to him without any interpreter between them. He will look to his right and will not see anything except that which he sent forth. And he will look to his left and will not see anything except that which he sent forth. Then he will look in front of him and will not see anything except Hellfire.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So let him remember this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third affair, is that he should remember that Allaah is with him; that Allaah sees him, hears him and knows everything about him! So Allaah is (constantly) with him with His Hearing, His Seeing and His Knowledge. So when you are by yourself and you are watching these movies and disgusting things, then remember that Allaah sees you right now and that Allaah knows about your situation! So do not say, “I am by myself,” but remind yourself that Allaah sees you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned that one of the Salaf used to differentiate between one of his students and the rest (of his students). So the students asked him about this, and then he wanted to clarify to the students why he differentiates. He gave each student a bird and said, “Slaughter it where nobody sees you.” So the students went and returned the next day, and all of them had slaughtered their bird except this one student. He said to this student, “O so-and-so, what have you done?” He answered, “I went there and there and there&#8230;” So he said, “And why have you not fulfilled my command?” He answered, “Every time I went to a place, I knew that Allaah is seeing me. So I couldn&#8217;t find a place where nobody sees me.” So he said, “Because of this, I love him. <strong>{Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwaa.}</strong> (49:13)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should remember this and that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, sees us. Then, O my brother, time is short and it passes with obedience and disobedience. By Allaah, time doesn&#8217;t stop with an obedient person, nor with a disobedient person. Remind yourself that if you are patient during these minutes, then it will pass without any sin. And that if you perform this sin, then it will pass with the sin and it will result in corruption in your heart, it will make your life difficult and it will cause wretchedness for you. And perhaps you will be prevented from a blessing because of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So remind yourself with this, and then remember that the eye will testify against you. The eye will testify against you with that which it has seen, in front of Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. So fear Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, and honour the greatness of Allaah. And if you do this, then you will be aided against Iblees, with the might and power of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the advice to perform a lot of du&#8217;aa (supplications). O brothers, whoever has been tried with a sin, then let him humble himself before Allaah in the last part of the night (saying), “O Allaah! Forgive me! O Lord, You are Most Knowledgeable about my situation! O Lord, I have been tried with this disease, so make me hate it, O Allaah! O Allaah, separate me from it as You have separated the East from the West!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humbling oneself and truthfully turning to Allaah is from the greatest means which lead to the rectification of your situation. So, O my brother&#8230; And this question of you indicates good and indicates that you want good and that you want to get rid (of this evil). Pray at night, for the arrows of the night do not miss their target. And humble yourself before Allaah while you are prostrating (saying), “O my Lord, O my Lord, O my Lord! Forgive me and save me from this calamity! O my Lord, make me hate it! O my Lord, separate me from it as You have separated the East from the West!” And Allaah is All-Hearing, Responsive. He is Near to His servants, He does not reject a truthful servant. And He feels Shy to reject the supplication of his truthful servant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So turn to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. And Allaah, the Most High, knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surat Al An&#8217;aam, Allah says:</p>
<p><strong>(Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Join not anything in worship with Him;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] be good and dutiful to your parents;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] kill not your children because of poverty&#8221; – We provide sustenance for you as well as them –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] &#8220;Come not near Al-Fawahish (great sins and illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you with that you may understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] And come not near to the orphan&#8217;s property except to improve it until he or she attains the age of full strength;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] and give full measure and full weight with justice&#8221; – We burden not any person, but that which they can bear –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] &#8220;And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] and fulfill the Covenant of Allah. This He commands you that you may remember.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] And verily, this (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses) is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious.)[ [Al An’aam: 151-153]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second: In Surat Al Israa Allaah azza wa jal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honor. And lower to them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: &#8220;My Lord! Bestow upon them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.&#8221; Your Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is Ever Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] And give to the kinsman his due and to the Miskeen (needy) and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Devil-Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord. And if you turn away from them (kindred, needy, wayfarer and have no wealth at the time they ask you) and are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then speak to them a soft, kind word (i.e. Allaah will provide for me and I shall give you). And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. Truly, your Lord increases the provision for whom He wills and straitens it (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever Well-Acquainted, All-Seer of His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them as well as you. Surely, killing them is a great sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] And do not kill anyone whose killing Allaah has forbidden except for a just cause. And whoever is killed wrongfully (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand Qisaas, Law of Equality in punishment – or to forgive, or to take the Diyah (blood money)]. But let him not exceed the limits in the matter of taking life (i.e. he should not kill anyone except the killer). Verily, he is aided (by the Islaamic law).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] And come not near to the orphan&#8217;s property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] And fulfill (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will be questioned about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] And follow not (O man, i.e., say not or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, the sight and the heart, each of those one will be questioned (by Allaah). And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height. [Al Israa: 23-39]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Ruling On Taswir (Painting, Drawing, Sculpture, Photography) Of Any Being With A Soul</strong> </span><br />
Fatwas of Shaikh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on Taswir (painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography), that is widely common among people? Would you please give us a comprehensive answer about lawful and unlawful Taswir? May Allah reward you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise is due to Allah alone. Peace be upon the Last Prophet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Sahih (authentic) books of Hadith, Musnad (Hadith compilation), and Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) indicating the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>prohibition of Taswir of any being with a soul, whether human or not</strong></span>. These texts urge defacing pictures and curse <strong>Musawwirs</strong> (those who make pictures and statues, or photographs of living beings), indicating that they will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following are some of the Sahih Hadith that were reported in this regard. We will cite the scholars&#8217; comments on them and explain the correct opinion concerning this matter In sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhary and Muslim) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) informed us that Allah (Exalted be He) stated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Who can be more unjust than one who tries to create a creation like Mine. Let them create an atom, a grain of wheat, or a grain of barley</span></em>. This wording reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahih, it is related on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be the Musawwirs<strong>.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related in the same books of Hadith on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Those whomake siwar (pictures, images, statues) will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them: Breathe soul into what you have created</span></em>. This wording is reported by Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Bukhari related in the Sahih on the authority of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him): <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade taking payment for blood, a dog, and the earnings of a prostitute. He cursed those who accept or pay Riba (usury/interest), a woman who tattoos others or gets herself tattooed, and the Musawwir.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever makes a sura (picture, icon, idol, etc.) in the world will be asked to breathe soul into it (on the Day of Resurrection), but they will not be able to breathe soul (into it).</span></em> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhary and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related by Muslim that Sa`id ibn Abu Al-Hasan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">A man came to Ibn `Abbas and said: I make suras, so tell me about (the ruling on) this. Ibn `Abbas said: Come closer to me. The man did. Ibn `Abbas asked him to come closer again and the man did and he put his hand on the man&#8217;s head and said: I will tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying. I heard him saying: Every Musawwir will enter the Fire and a soul will be given to every sura they made so that it would torment them in the Fire. He added: If you have to do this (go on in this profession), then make suras of trees and everything that does not have a soul.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;If you have to do this&#8230;&#8221; was related by Al-Bukhari in the aforementioned Hadith related by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it was related by Al-Tirmidhy in his Jami` Book of Hadith on the authority of Abu Al-Zubayr from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade having suras in the home and forbade the making of them</em>.</span> He commented that it was a Hadith Hasan Sahih (a valid and authentic Hadith).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to me, and I had screened my alcove with a curtain on which there were suras. When he saw it, he tore it up and the color of his face changed [due to anger] and he said, &#8220;O `Aishah! The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation.&#8221; `Aishah added: So we tore it up and we stuffed a cushion or two with it.</span></em> (Related by Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) returned from a journey and I had covered my alcove with a curtain on which there were suras. No sooner did he see it than he tore it up and said: Those who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation. She said: Thus, we turned it (i.e. The curtain) into one or two cushions.</span></em> (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Muslim added, &#8220;his face changed&#8221; after &#8220;he tore it up&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She also narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) returned from a journey and I had hung a thick curtain having suras. He ordered me to remove it and I did.</span></em> (Related by Al-Bukhari). Imam Muslim also related it with the following wording: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">I had screened my door with a thick curtain having suras of winged horses. He ordered me to remove it and I did.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad from `Aishah who narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">I bought a cushion with suras on it. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) saw it, he kept standing at the door and did not enter the house. I noticed the sign of disgust on his face, so I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I repent to Allah and to His Messenger. (Please let me know) what sin I have done.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;What about this cushion?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I bought it for you to sit and recline on.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;The makers of these suras will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, &#8216;Breathe life into what you have created.'&#8221; He (peace be upon him) added, &#8220;Angels do not enter a house where there are suras.&#8221;</span></em> (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Muslim added from Ibn Al-Majishun that `Aishah said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;I took it and turned it into two pillows on which he used to recline at home.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a sura.</span></em> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhary and Muslim). This wording is reported by Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related by Muslim on the authority of Zayd ibn Khalid from Abu Talhah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a statue.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is also reported] in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Jibril said: We do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a sura.&#8221;</span></em> The same Hadith was related by Muslim on the authority of `Aishah and Maymunah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Muslim related on the authority of Abu Al-Hayyaj Al-Asady who said: `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I not order you of the same thing which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered me; leave no sura unspoiled and leave no outstanding grave unleveled</span></em>. It is related by Abu Dawud with a good Sanad (chain of narration) on the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">ordered `Umar ibn Al-Khattab during the time of the Conquest of Makkah while he was in Al-Bat-ha&#8217; to go to the Ka`bah and efface every sura in it.</span></em> The Prophet (peace be upon him) only entered it when all suras were effaced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Abu Dawud Al-Tayalisy related in his Musnad on the authority of Usamah who said: I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Ka`bah and he saw suras. He, thus, ordered to bring him a bucket of water and when I did, he began erasing them, saying: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah fight those who make Taswir of what they are not able to create.</span></em> Al-Hafizh said: Its Sanad (chain of narrators) is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: `Umar ibn Shabbah related from `Abdul-Rahman ibn Mahran from `Umayr, the freed slave of Ibn `Abbas, from Usamah that: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the Ka`bah and ordered me to bring him some water in a bucket. He wet his garment and beat the suras with it, saying: May Allah fight those who make Taswir of what they are not able to create.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Bukhari related in his Sahih on the authority of `Aishah that she narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) never left in his house anything bearing crosses on it without obliterating it.</span></em> The same Hadith was narrated by Al-Kushmihany using the term <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Tasawir (i.e. Pictures) instead of crosses</span></em>. Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him) entitled a chapter in his collection of Hadith: <strong>&#8220;Obliterating Suras&#8221;</strong> where he related this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahih Books of Hadith, it is related on the authority of Busr ibn Sa`id from Zayd ibn Khalid from Abu Talhah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Angels do not enter a house in which there is a sura</em></span>. Busr said, &#8220;Zayd then fell ill and we went to visit him but there was a curtain with a sura hanging at his door. I said to `Ubaydullah Al-Khawlany: the stepson of Maymunah &#8211; the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Did not Zayd tell us about (the ruling on) suras the day before? `Ubaydullah said: Did you not hear when he said: Except a design in a cloth.&#8221; In the Two Sahih, it is related on the authority of `Amr ibn Al-Harith from Bukayr Al-Ashaj from Busr that he said, &#8220;I said to `UbaydullahAl-Khawlani: Did he not tell us about (the ruling on) suras? He said: He said, &#8220;Except a design in a cloth. Did you not hear him?&#8221; I said: No and he said: He said, &#8220;He indeed did say that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the Musnad and Sunan Al-Nasa&#8217;y on the authority of `Ubaydullah ibn `Abdullah who narrated that he went to Abu Talhah Al-Ansary to visit him during his illness and found Sahl ibn Hunayf with him. Abu Talhah asked someone to remove a rug on the floor. Sahl asked: Why do you (want to) remove it? He replied: Because it includes suras and I know what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said about them (suras &#8211; i.e. the ruling on them). He said: Did he not say: &#8220;Except a design in a cloth&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Yes, but this is more comfortable for me.&#8221; The Sanad of this Hadith is valid. Al-Tirmidhy related it in the same wording and commented, &#8216;It is a Sahih Hasan Hadith.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y related with a good Sanad on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Jibril came to me and said: ‘I came to you yesterday and nothing prevented me from entering except that there were statues by your door, there was a curtain in your house with suras on it, and there was a dog in the house. Tell someone to cut off the head of the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to tear up the curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on; and tell someone to put the dog outside.’</span> </em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did that. The dog belonged to Al-Hasan or Al-Husayn and was under their couch. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that it would be taken outside the house. This is the wording of Abu Dawud and a similar wording was reported by Al-Tirmidhy. The following is the wording of Al-Nasa&#8217;y: Jibril asked the Prophet&#8217;s permission to enter his house whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;Get in,&#8221; but Jibril replied, <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;How could I enter your house and there is a curtain on which there are suras? Either you cut off their heads or make it (the curtain) into a cushion spread out so that the people may tread on. We, angels, do not enter a house in which there are suras.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadith conveying the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadith and those which are similar in meaning evidently indicate that Taswir of any being with a soul is prohibited and is one of the major sins entailing the threat of punishment in the Fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This prohibition is applicable to all forms of Taswir, whether the sura has a shadow or not, and whether it is on a wall, a curtain, a garment, a mirror, a paper, etc. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not differentiate between that which has a shadow and that which has no shadow or between what is drawn on a curtain or not. In fact, he cursed Musawwirs, saying that they will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection and that all of them will enter the Fire, without making any exceptions.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that this prohibition is general is supported by the evidence that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw suras on the curtain in the house of `Aishah, he tore it up and the color of his face changed and he said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation</span></em>. In another narration, he said when he saw the curtain: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The makers of these suras will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them: ‘Breathe life into what you have created.&#8217;</span> </em>This narration and similar ones clearly indicate that Musawwirs are included in the general admonishment, whether they make suras on curtains or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his statement &#8220;except a design in a cloth&#8221; in the Hadith narrated by Abu Talhah and Sahl ibn Hunayf, this is an exception to suras which prevent the entry of angels but not an exception far Taswir as understood by the context of the Hadith. This means that Taswir is only permissible if the design in a cloth or the like is made to be used in a disrespectful fashion, such as the cushion that was made to be sat on as stated in the aforementioned Hadith narrated by `Aishah, in which she tore up the curtain and made it into one or two cushions, and the Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah in which Jibril said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), &#8220;<em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Tell someone to cut off the head of the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to tear up the curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on&#8230;&#8221;</span></em> The Prophet (peace be upon him) did that. It is not permissible to apply this exception to suras in a cloth that is to be hung on a door or a wall or the like because the texts of Hadith narrated by `Aishah in this regard clearly indicate that such curtains is forbidden, and must be removed and torn up as already stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith as narrated by Abu Hurayrah unmistakably means that such curtains prevent the entry of angels unless it is made into something to be treaded on or the head of the statue is cut off so that it takes the shape of a tree. The statements of Prophet (peace be upon him) do not conflict with each other; they confirm the validity of each other.Whenever it is possible to reconcile between various Hadith in a proper manner without any prejudice, it becomes obligatory to do so and to give this precedence over adopting the approach of Tarjih (comparing an opinion with another to choose the most appropriate one) and Naskh (abrogation) as stated in the sciences of Usul-ul-Hadith (principles of Hadith) and Mustalah Al-Hadith (Hadith terminology). Here, it was possible to reconcile between the quoted texts. All praise is due to Allah for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-Fath, Al-Hafizh gave precedence to reconciliation between Hadith in the manner that I have already mentioned. He said, &#8220;Al-Khattaby said: The suras which forbid angels from entering a house are those whose possession is prohibited e.g. The suras of beings with souls whose heads are not cut off or are not treated in a disrespectful manner.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Khattaby (may Allah be merciful to him) said, <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;In fact, the punishment of a Musawwir is made severe because suras were worshipped besides Allah. Furthermore, looking at them may become a sort of Fitnah (temptation) and some souls might be attached to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Nawawy (may Allah be merciful to him) stated the following in Sharh Muslim, &#8220;Chapter: The prohibition of Taswir of animate beings and the prohibition of possessing that which has a sura un-trodden in a carpet or the like. In fact, the angels do not enter a house in which there is a sura or a dog&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Our companions and other scholars commented: Taswir of animate beings is extremely prohibited and is a major sin, because severe warnings are made against the Musawwir in the Hadith; whether they make suras to be used in a disrespectful fashion or for other purposes, this profession is prohibited in all cases, because it implies that one is trying to match the Creation of Allah (Exalted be He). There is no difference whether the sura is in a cloth, carpet, coin, vessel, wall or whatever. With regard to making Taswir of trees and camel saddlebags and other inanimate beings, this is not prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the ruling on Taswir. As for making Taswir of animate beings, this is prohibited if the suras are to be hung on a wall or worn as clothing or a turban or what is similar to that of things that are not considered to be in a state of degradation or disrespect. On the other hand, if suras are made on carpets, cushions, or similar articles to be used in a disrespectful fashion, it is not prohibited to possess them. There is no difference (in the prohibition) between that which has a shadow and that which has no shadow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is our own opinion on this issue and the opinion of Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) from among the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), the Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), and those who came after them. It is also the opinion of Al-Thawry, Malik, Abu Hanifah, and others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Some of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) believed that suras which are prohibited are only those which cast a shadow and that there is no harm in the suras which do not cast a shadow. However, this is an invalid opinion because the curtain that the Prophet (peace be upon him) disapproved was undoubtedly disrespected and the sura did not cast a shadow. This is in addition to the general and inclusive Hadith [forbidding] all kinds of Taswir.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After summarizing the opinion of Al-Nawawy, Al-Hafizh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The opinion that the prohibition of Taswir is general, including that which casts a shadow and that which has no shadow, is supported by the Hadith related by Ahmad on the authority of `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) who narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Anyone of you who goes to Al-Madinah must not leave there any idol without breaking it up nor any sura without obliterating it.</em></span> In another narration, the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Whoever returns to make these things (suras) has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever looks closely at the previously quoted Hadith will notice that they denote that the prohibition of Taswir is general and inclusive of that which has a shadow and that which has no shadow &#8211; as already explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may be claimed that the Hadith narrated by Zayd ibn Khalid from Abu Talhah that Busr ibn Sa`id, the narrator from Zayd, said: &#8220;Zayd then fell ill and we went to visit him but there was a curtain with a sura hanging at his door&#8221; apparently denotes that Zayd believed in the permissibility of hanging curtains including suras.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this claim is that the aforementioned Hadith narrated by `Aishah and other Hadith conveying the same meaning all serve as evidence on the prohibition of hanging curtains that include suras, the obligation of tearing them up, and the fact that they prohibit the entry of angels. If the Hadith reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) are Sahih (authentic), it is not permissible to contradict them because of a saying or action of any person, whoever they may be. Likewise, believers are obligated to follow these Hadith, hold fast to that which they indicate, and reject whatever contradicts them. Allah (Exalted be He) states: And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Say: &#8220;Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allâh’s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messenger’s duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way).&#8221; Allah (Glorified be He) has, thus, guaranteed the guidance of those who obey the Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Exalted be He) states: And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) was not aware of the sura which was on the curtain or did not hear about the Hadith on the prohibition of hanging curtains including suras and, thus, his action followed the apparent meaning of the statement of the Prophet &#8220;except a design in a cloth&#8221;. Therefore, he would be free from blame for not having knowledge of the Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who know the Sahih Hadith indicating the prohibition of hanging curtains including suras, there is no excuse for them. Whoever contradicts Sahih Hadith in order to follow their whims or to blindly follow others will necessarily deserve the Anger of their Lord and may be tried with deviation and Fitnah of the heart. Allah (Glorified be He) states: And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#008000;">So when they turned away (from the Path of Allâh), Allâh turned their hearts away (from the Right Path)</span>.</em> Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <em><span style="color:#008000;">So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah indicates that it is permissible to keep a sura in a house if its head is cut off, because it would then be in the shape of a tree. This proves that it is permissible to make Taswir of trees and any beings which have no souls. This was already mentioned clearly in the narration of the two Sheikhs (Al-Bukhary and Muslim) on the authority of Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The quoted Hadith is also a proof that cutting off anything other than the head of the sura such as cutting off the lower half or the like, is not enough to render it permissible to keep or to allow the entry of angels. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered it to be torn up and efface the suras, saying that they prevent the entry of angels, with the exception of suras that are to be treated in a disrespectful manner or whose heads have been cut off. Thus, whoever has any claim justifying the permissibility of keeping suras at home other than for these two stated reasons must bring evidence supporting their claim from the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us that if the head of the sura is cut off, the remainder of it will be like the shape of a tree, this proves that the factor which permits its possession is its being transformed from the shape of beings with souls to a form similar to inanimate beings. If the lower part of the sura is cut off and the head remains, it will not take the shape of a tree because the face still remains. Furthermore, the face has a beauty and uniqueness of creation that is not found in the rest of the body. Hence, it is not permissible for a person who understands the intended meanings of the quoted Nas (Islamic text from the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah) to make Qiyas (analogy) between cutting off any other part of the body and cutting off the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is clear that making Taswir of the head and other parts of the body of animate beings is prohibited because the ruling stated by the aforementioned Sahih Hadith is generally applied and no one is allowed to make exceptions to this general ruling beyond those stated by the Law-Giver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">There is no difference in this ruling between corporeal suras and others inscribed on curtains, papers, etc. As there is no difference between suras of humans and other beings with souls and the suras of kings, scholars, etc. In fact, the degree of prohibition regarding the suras of kings, scholars, and other influential people is severer, because the Fitnah that might be caused by them is greater. Also, hanging their suras in sitting areas and elsewhere and revering them are of the most dangerous means leading to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and to the worship of such persons along with Allah as happened to the people of Nuh.</span> </strong>Al-Khattaby pointed to this in his statements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), there were many suras that people used to revere and worship other than Allah until Allah sent his Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who destroyed the idols, obliterated the suras, and removed Shirk and its means. Therefore, anyone who makes Taswir or hangs suras and reveres them has imitated the Kafirs (disbelievers) in their actions and opened the door to Shirk and its means for the people. Likewise, any person who orders the making of Taswir and is pleased with it will have the same ruling of a Musawwir in terms of having done something prohibited and being entitled to the threat. This is because the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah, and the scholars&#8217; opinions have all decreed that it is prohibited to order something entailing disobedience and to be pleased with acts of disobedience just as it is prohibited to commit such acts. Allah (Exalted be He) states: <em><span style="color:#008000;">And when you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’ân) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaitân (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).</span></em> Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <em><span style="color:#008000;">And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’ân) that when you hear the Verses of Allâh being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them</span></em>. The Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) indicates that whoever is present while Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is being committed and does not turn away from it is like those who are doing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the one who remains silent about Munkar, although they are able to reject it or to leave the place where Munkar is committed, is like the doer of Munkar but the one who enjoin the Munkar or is pleased with it will be more sinful than the one who remains silent about it and will be more deserving to be like those who actually commit it. There are several evidences conveying the same meaning and can be easily found by whomever seeks them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the light of the Hadith and the scholars&#8217; opinion mentioned above, it is clear that making Taswir of beings with souls that are widely spread in books, magazines, newspapers, and letters, is a plain mistake and an act of disobedience. People must beware of it and warn each other against it; and must make sincere Tawbah (repentance) for what they have done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the aforementioned evidence indicates that it is not permissible to keep such suras without cutting off their heads or effacing them unless they are on a carpetor something similar which is treated in a disrespectful manner. In this case only, is it permissible to possess them as already supported by the Hadith narrated by `Aishah and Abu Hurayrah As for toys in the form of beings with souls, scholars have differed about the permissibility of their possession by little girls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith: On the authority of `Aishah who narrated: I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and I had female friends who used to play along with me. They would hide from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) whenever he entered, but he would call them to join and play with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafizh said in Al-Fath, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">This Hadith has been used as a proof for the permissibility of possessing suras of dolls and toys so that young girls may play with them. This has been an exception to the general prohibition of possessing suras</span></strong>. `Iyad confirmed this opinion and reported that it was the same opinion of the Jumhur who permitted the selling of toys for little girls to train them from childhood for household responsibilities and childrearing. He added that some scholars believed that this permissibility was Mansukh (abrogated). Ibn Battal inclined to this opinion. It is reported from Ibn Abu Zayd from Malik that he disliked that a man buys dolls for his daughter. Accordingly, Al-Dawudy was in favor of the opinion that the permissibility was Mansukh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;However, Ibn Hibban entitled a chapter: Permissibility for young women to play with dolls. Al-Nasa&#8217;y also entitled a chapter: Man&#8217;s permitting his wife to play with dolls. He did not restrict this to childhood, but this opinion is debatable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;After mentioning the Takhrij (referencing) of Hadith, Al-Bayhaqy said, &#8220;The prohibition of possessing suras has been confirmed.&#8221; Thus, the permission given to `Aishah in this matter was perhaps before rendering it as prohibited. The same opinion was held by Ibn Al-Jawzy.&#8221; He went on to say, &#8220;Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y related another narration on the authority of `Aishah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) returned from the Battle of Tabuk or Khaybar&#8230; And he mentioned the Hadith of tearing up the curtain which `Aishah had hung at her door. She said, &#8220;The side of the curtain which was over dolls of `Aishah was uncovered. He (peace be upon him) asked: What is this, O `Aishah? She answered: My dolls. She, then, said: He saw amongst them a two-winged horse tied up. He asked about it and she replied: A horse having two wings. Did not youhear that Sulayman had horses with wings? Upon this, he laughed.&#8221; He continued to say, &#8220;Al-Khattaby said: This Hadith indicates that playing with dolls is not like having amusement with other suras regarding which warnings have been issued. In fact, `Aishah was given the permission to play with dolls, because she had not reached the age of puberty at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I believe that it is questionable to confirm that she had not reached the age of puberty at that time, though it might possibly be so. This is because `Aishah at the time of the Battle of Khaybar was fourteen years old; she was either past the age of fourteen or was approaching it. In the Battle of Tabuk, on the other hand, she definitely had reached the age of puberty. Thus, the strongest opinion is that of those who said it was in the Battle of Khaybar. Reconciliation is to be made with what Al-Khattaby stated because this is better than assuming that the reports are in conflict.&#8221; This is the end of Al-Hafizh&#8217;s quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you have understood what Al-Hafizh (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned, then it is safer to avoid possession of toys. This is because their lawfulness is doubtful due to the possibility that the Prophet (peace be upon him) might have approved of `Aishah&#8217;s possession of dolls before the order to efface suras was revealed. In such a case, the permission would be considered Mansukh by the Hadith including the order to efface suras except those whose heads are cut off or those which are degraded, as stated by Al-Bayhaqy, Ibn Al-Jawzy, and Ibn Battal. Another possibility is that this permission could be a special exception to the general prohibition, as the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) have stated, for the sake of training girls to be mothers and because playing with dolls entails a kind of disrespect. As this possibilities loom and the doubt is there, it is safer to avoid the possession of toys and dolls. In fact, it is better to train girls using non-corporeal toys in order to be safe from the questionable matter regarding the possession of corporeal dolls. In this way, you will be acting according to the following Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. Also, it is narrated on the authority of Al-Nu`man ibn Bashir &#8211; as related in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are doubtful matters which many people do not know. Thus, whoever guards against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and whoever indulges in doubtful matters, indulges, in fact, in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures their animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it</span></em>. And Allah knows best!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">On the <strong>10<sup>th</sup> Sha&#8217;baan 1433 / 30<sup>th</sup> June 2012</strong> our <strong>Shaykh Ahmad &#8216;Umar Bazmool</strong> (حفظه الله تعالى) delivered a beneficial advice to some youth who had come from the UK to make Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture the Shaykh mentioned from amongst other things, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The commandment of asking the people of knowledge if you do not know.</li>
<li>The obligation of seeking knowledge to remove ignorance</li>
<li>The importance of being kind to your parents, not even saying &#8220;uff&#8221; to them</li>
<li>Taking care of the parents in old age and seeking their forgiveness</li>
<li>Being patient with Allah&#8217;s decree and not using it as an excuse to justify his sinning</li>
<li>Do an action to the best of your ability in matters of religion and worldly matters</li>
<li>Defending the status of women in Islam, responding to false accusations</li>
<li>The plots of Shaytaan, the enemy of the believers…</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The advice was concluded with the children being given the opportunity to get any questions they had answered by the Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to time constraints we were unable to put forward all of the questions to our Shaykh.  We will try our best to arrange a second sitting with our Shaykh to put forward the remainder of the questions and any others these children may have.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh, hafidhahullah, gave us a summarized explanation of the hadith narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub when he said that that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often used to ask his companions, ‘Did any one of you see a  dream?’ So dreams would be described to him by those who Allaah willed should speak. One morning, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Last night, two men came to me and said to me, &#8216;Let us go!&#8217;, and I set out with them&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh also gave us some general advice regarding dreams, wajazaahum Allahu khairan.</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Dream of the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam </strong></div>
<p>Narrated Samura bin Jundub<strong>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>“Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).” I think the Prophet said, “In that oven there was much noise and voices.” The Prophet added, “We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “…. red like blood.” The Prophet added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these (two) persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Go up and I went up’ The Prophet added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me, ‘This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, ‘That (palace) is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day)</p>
<p>I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’<br />
They replied, ‘We will inform you:</p>
<p>As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world.</p>
<p>And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#000000;">adulterers and the adulteresses</span></span>;,and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).”</p>
<p>The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, “O Allah’s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?” The Prophet replied, “And also the children of pagans.”</p>
<p>The Prophet added, “My two companions added,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p>‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">What is meant by this type of fitnah is the fitnah of the desires which leads to and encourages one to engage in and commit sins or disobedience to Allah.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">This type of fitnah is very dangerous especially in our times because of the fact that this type of fitnah is more appealing and closer to those who have weak souls. Thus, the (weak) individual gives in the first time, then gets drawn in to this type of fitnah and establishes a strong foothold in committing sins. Thus, his iman (faith) weakens or even leaves.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Some examples of this type of fitnah are:<strong> the desire for wealth, immoralities, amusement, food and drink, clothes, and the desire to imitate the kuffar and sinners</strong>. For example, the lust for wealth leads to falling into numerous sins like the bloodshed which emanates between warring countries or between tribes, breaking into people’s homes and businesses or their cars, embezzling people’s money by unlawful means or prohibited means like fraud or selling things which are prohibited.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Lust for immoralities leads to committing unlawful acts like <strong>rape, fornication or adultery, homosexuality, masturbation, luring minors or weak minded individuals into committing inappropriate acts</strong>. It also leads to <strong>watching pornographic channels, videos, on the internet or magazines</strong>. It also leads to harassing or <strong>following women</strong> in shopping malls or with video enhanced networking devices like that are included in mobile phones and computer cameras. In addition to these vices, this type of fitnah leads to lethargy with regards to performing the obligatory actions in addition to leniency with regards to them and even leads to eventually leaving them completely, not performing them at all. An individual may be chaste, have fear of Allah, be religious and then open the door to this type of fitnah and as a result become corrupt and then be destroyed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong>, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is quite amazing how it can be easy upon a person to be cautious and wary with regards to [different impermissible acts such as]: eating from unlawful means, oppression, adultery and fornication, stealing, drinking intoxicants, looking at prohibited things and the likes, and yet quite difficult for him to be careful about the movement of his tongue. So bad that you find a person towards whom the people point to concerning his practice of the Religion, his asceticism, and worship, and despite this he says statements that anger Allaah greatly and he shows no concern about this, yet this statement will take him [to a Fire] that is farther than distance between east and west. (1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many people do you see from amongst those who have enough piety to abstain from lewd, indecent acts, oppression and wrong doing, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">but their tongues rip apart the honor of both the dead and the living and they show not a care in the least</span>.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">General advice  Some of the Major Sins</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>[1] Backbiting</strong>,  <strong>[2] Tale-bearing</strong>,  <strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Envy</strong>,  <strong>[4] Injustice</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From <strong>`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</strong> to those who see it of my Muslim brothers, may Allah grant me and them success in fulfilling what pleases Him, and keep us away from disobeying Him, Amen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!), to continue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise every Muslim to have Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared) in all circumstances and guard his tongue from saying anything other than that which is useful, because Mubah (permissible) talk may lead to what is Haram (prohibited) or Makruh (reprehensible), and this is common among people, Allah the Exalted says: <span style="color:#008000;">Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allâh)</span>. The Prophet (may Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him) also says in the Hadith agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim and narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should either utter good words or stay silent&#8230;&#8221;</span> .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are things that may be a topic of talks but should not be spoken and one should be warned against talking about them, for they could lead to major sins, which would lead to displeasing Allah and to His Punishment. These things have become commonly widespread in some communities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- <span style="color:#ff0000;">Backbiting</span></strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is talking about your brother or sister in a way that they would dislike, if they heard about it, whether it be talking about their body, family, character, actions, sayings or about their religion or life, or even talking ill about their clothes, home or car.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Do you know what backbiting is? They (the Companions) said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Thereupon, he (the Prophet) said: Backbiting is talking about your brother in a manner which he does not like. It was said to him: What is your opinion, if I actually find (that failing) in my brother that which I made a mention of? He said: If (that failing) is actually found (in him) what you assert, then you in fact, backbit him, and if it is not in him, it is a slander against him</span>. Reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Backbiting is Haram (prohibited), no matter what the reason behind it; whether it is to calm down rage, or to compliment those present and make conversation with them, or reconciling or courtesy of companions. Or to encourage others to speak or to envy others or just for fun, or to waste time or if a person speaks ill of others to make those present laugh. Allah the Exalted forbade this, and warned His slaves against it, He the Exalted says: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a Hadith by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Muslim is inviolable by his Muslim brother, with regard to his blood, wealth and honor</span> Reported by Muslim. He (peace be upon him) said in his final Khutbah (sermon) in his Farewell Hajj: <span style="color:#008000;">Your blood, your properties and your honors are as sacred to one another as the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. (Listen) Have I not conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you?</span> Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. It is also narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The worst kind of usury is indulging in evil talk about the honor of your Muslim brother</span>. Reported by Al-Bazzar and Abu Dawud. The authentic Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that refer to the prohibition of backbiting and warning against it are so many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- Among vices that should be avoided, kept away from and warned against is <span style="color:#ff0000;">tale-bearing</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It refers to the act of transferring conversations from one person to another, or from one group to another, or from one tribe to anotherwith the intention of causing corruption and driving people away from each other. It includes disclosing what people dislike no matter if the person reported, the person informed, or even others may dislike it. This act of disclosing may be done verbally, written, or by using code, or gestures regardless of the subject reported whether it is a saying or an action and whether it is a defect or imperfection in the person reported or not. A person must refrain from talking about what he knows or sees in people, unless there is some benefit to Muslims in transferring information or that it will eliminate evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Motives behind tale-bearing is either to cause evil to the person being spoken about or to show love to the person who is being informed, or to engage in ones advantages and disadvantages; all of which is forbidden. No one should believe rumor mongers; because a person who gossips is considered a Fasiq (someone openly and flagrantly violating Islamic law), whose Shahadah (testimony of faith) is rejected. Allah the Exalted says:<span style="color:#008000;"> O you who believe! If a Fâsiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance</span> , one must forbid him from doing so, advise him against it, and condemn the act, for Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8230;enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf &#8211; (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad) One should dislike him for Allah&#8217;s sake and should not think negatively of his brother, who is being spoken about. He should think good of his brother, Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins</span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;">Beware of suspicion, for it is the worst of false tales</span>. Agreed upon its authenticity i.e. reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should not spy on the person who was spoken about or defame his self by committing the same forbidden act that the gossiper committed by repeating the gossip which he heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for the prohibition of tale-bearing in the Quran and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) are many; for example, Allah (Exalted be He) says: And (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) obey you not everyone Hallaf Mahîn (the one who swears much and is a liar or is worthless). [Tafsir At-Tabari] A slanderer, going about with calumnies, Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Woe to every slanderer and backbiter. It is narrated by Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The story-teller will not enter Paradise</span> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Should I inform you what slandering is? It is tale-carrying, which creates dissension amongst people</span>. Reported by Muslim. Tale-bearing is one of the reasons of punishment in the grave, for Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by two graves and said: <span style="color:#008000;">“These two people are being tortured not for a major sin (to avoid).” The Prophet (peace be upon him) then added, “Yes! (they are being tortured for a major sin). Indeed, one of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine while the other used to go about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends).”</span> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Backbiting and tale-bearing are forbidden due to the damage they cause, the corruption between people and the divisions and chaos which it creates, igniting the fire of hatred, envy and hypocrisy, and eliminating all affection and fatality. Also causing quarrels and discord among brothers who were once close. It also involves lying, treachery, betrayal, deception and accusations of the innocent, which lead one to curse, abuse and insult. They are sings of cowardice, and pettiness and defect. In addition to this, the sinners who make these accusations will bear many sins, which will lead to the wrath of Allah, and indignation and painful punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3- That which should be avoided and kept away from, a reprehensible trait, which is known as <span style="color:#ff0000;">envy</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, a person wishing that a certain bounty and grace be removed from his brother in Islam, whether this grace and bounty is related to religion or is worldly. This is objecting to what Allah has destined and granted His slaves. This is injustice by the envious person to himself for his Iman (faith) is decreased due to this, causing calamities and concerns for himself, ruining him in a great way. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Or do they envy men (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his followers) for what Allâh has given them of His Bounty?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Do not be envious of one another; do not artificially inflate prices against one another; do not hate one another; do not shun one another; and do not undercutone another in business transactions; and be as fellow-brothers and servants of Allah</span>. Reported by Muslim. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also narrated that the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Avoid envy, for envy devours good deeds just as fire devours fuel.</span> Reported by Abu Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- A person is also required to stay away from <span style="color:#ff0000;">injustice</span>, which is being <span style="color:#ff0000;">unfair and legal misbehavior</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The biggest of these is Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah) of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) through violation and sins. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when Luqmân said to his son when he was advising him: “O my son! Join not in worship others with Allâh. Verily joining others in worship with Allâh is a great Zûlm (wrong) indeed</span>. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">And it is the disbelievers who are the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also includes taking other people&#8217;s property without the right to do so, or taking something from one&#8217;s land or attacking or abusing them, which is also a major sin and disobedience of Allah. This is &#8211; we seek refuge in Allah- a result of the darkness of ones heart, for if one&#8217;s heart was lit with the light of guidance, then he would have reconsidered, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">There will be no friend, nor an intercessor for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers), who could be given heed to</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and for the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) there is no helper</span>. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:<span style="color:#008000;"> Consider not that Allâh is unaware of that which the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">And whoever among you does wrong (i.e. sets up rivals to Allâh), We shall make him taste a great torment</span>. It is reported in Sahih (authentic book) Muslim, from Abu Dhar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Allah (the Exalted) says: &#8220;O My servants, I have forbidden injustice upon Myself and have forbidden it for you, so do not wrong one another&#8230;&#8221;</span> It is also narrated by Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Be on your guard against committing oppression, for oppression is a darkness on the Day of Recompense</span> Likewise, `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allahbe pleased with them) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A Muslim is the one who avoids harming Muslims with his tongue and hands. And a Muhajir (emigrant) is the one who gives up (abandons) all that Allah has forbidden.</span> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). These Hadiths and others with the same meaning are evident that one should be warned of injustice in matters related people, their honor, and property, due to the great evil and great corruption and their dire consequences. They also indicate the obligation of Tawbah (repentance to Allah) to Allah, the Exalted, of past sins and advising others to leave all that Allah has forbidden of injustice and all other sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant me and you good attitude and good deeds and keep us away from bad deeds and attitudes! May He guide us to His Straight Path, for He is All-Gracious and The Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!).<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Taken from “Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee tafseer Kalaamil-Mannaan” of Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa‟dee.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">And no soul shall bear the burden of sin of another, and if a soul heavily laden with sin calls someone else to bear its sins, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin</span>.][Sooratul-Faatir (35): Ayah 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa‟dee- rahimahullaah-said in his Tafseer of the Aayah: “And the last meaning is indicated by what He mentioned after it, in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">And no soul shall bear the burden of sin of another</span>], meaning: on the Day of Resurrection everyone shall be recompensed for his own deeds, and no one shall carry the sins of anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">And if a soul heavily laden with sin calls someone else to bear its sins</span>]: i.e. a soul weighed down with sins and evil deeds: if it calls on someone to take on some of its sins,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">Then nothing from it will be carried, even if the one asked were a close relative</span>], for sins cannot be carried (even) for a close relative. So the Hereafter is not the same as this world, where relatives can help each other, and close friends. Rather on the Day of Resurrection a person will wish that he had some right due to him from anyone, even if it be his parents or his close relatives.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><strong>Repelling the consequences of sinning</strong></p>
<p align="center">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem <strong>Ibn Taymeeyah</strong> (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p>‘It has been established in the ‘Saheeh’ of al-Bukhari from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p align="center">‘Indeed one’s actions are judged by his final actions.’</p>
<p>Therefore, if the believer commits evil than its consequences are repelled from him with ten means:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">That he repents, by which Allaah turns to him, since indeed the one who repents from a sin is like the one who has no sin at all.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or that the person seeks forgiveness from Allaah and Allaah forgives him.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or he does good actions to wipe out that sin, since indeed good deeds take away evil deeds.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or that his believing brothers supplicate for him and seek forgiveness for him, whether he is alive or deceased.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or relay to him the reward of his actions, those with which Allaah benefits him by.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or that his Prophet Muhammad intercedes for him.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or Allaah trials him in the Dunya with problems and difficulties expiate his sins.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or Allaah trials him in al-Barzakh (the stage after death until the Day of Judgment) with Fitnah and being squeezed in the grave, which expiate his sins.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or Allah trials him with events of al-Qayyama (Resurrection) due to the horror at that time, which expiate his sins.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or The Most Merciful [Allaah] of those who show mercy has mercy upon him.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Repenting from all sins but keeping the ill-gotten money</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 6: A person used to abandon Salah (prayer), drink alcohol and commit vile deeds. He has a lot of ill-gotten money. He then turned to Allah with sincere repentance with regard to all the sins mentioned above except the ill-gotten money. Should he get rid of such ill-gotten money? Or will he be treated like a new Muslim who is not asked about the source of his wealth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: on turning to Allah with sincere repentance with regards to the ill-gotten money, it is obligatory for one to get rid of such evil money. In case he is not able to define the ill-gotten money, he can give out what he thinks to clear himself from such guilt. This is to be followed if his sins have not caused him to leave Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On committing sins that make a person leave Islam such as the abandonment of Salah, according to the most preponderant opinion of scholars, even if such a person does not deny its obligation, repentance can be realized by performing Salah and embracing Islam again. This is because Islam wipes out all that has gone before it. <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Also, one is not obliged to get rid of the money he got before adopting Islam. This is because Allay (Exalted be He) says about the disbelievers, Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven</span></strong>. As mentioned in the Sahih (Authentic Book of Hadith), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). And penitence also wipes out all that has gone before it.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AL-FAWA&#8217;ID: A Collection of Wise Syaings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forbidden pleasure is combined with ugliness and it will cause pain after the moment has passed. If you feel strongly inclined toward it, you should think about the pain it will leave behind. It is necessary to compare the two matters and discover the difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suffering pain while worshiping Allah is combined with a good soul that will bear the fruit of pleasure and relief. When the soul finds it heavy and thinks to stop the pain and then compares the end results of the two  matters, he will surely prefer the way of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you feel pain because of deeds, you should think about the happiness, joy, and pleasure you will gain, then the pain will seem easy to bear. If you get hurt because of abandoning some kind of forbidden pleasure, you should think about the pain that follows it and compare the two kinds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To make the correct choice, you must know the reasons and consequences of each act and then choose that which is more deserving and useful. Whoever succeeds at doing this, would choose the better and prefer it. Whoever thinks about this Worldly life and the Hereafter, would know that he will never gain either of them except by hardship. He should bear this hardship in order to gain the best and more lasting of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="post_message_252895">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who will have a worse punishment (in the Hereafter): The sinners or the innovators?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innovators will have a worse punishment, since innovations are worse than sins. Innovations are more beloved to the Devil than sins because (it is likely that) the sinner may repent &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan Ath-Thawree, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees (the Devil) than sins. This is because sins are repented from whereas innovations are not repented from.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa (11/472))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily Allaah has prevented repentance from every person of innovation.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (1620))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; but as for the innovator, then very rarely does he repent because he thinks that he is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is contrary to the sinner for he knows that he is disobeying Allaah and that he is committing a sinful deed. As for the innovator, he considers himself to be obeying Allaah and to be upon obedience. This is why innovation – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – is worse than sin. And this is why the Salaf warned the people from sitting and gathering with the innovators –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Al-Hasan Al-Basree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do not sit with a person of innovation, for indeed he will put a disease in your heart.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-I’tisaam of Ash-Shaatibee (1/72) verified by Saleem Al-Hilaalee and Al-Bid’a wan-Nahee ‘anhaa of Ibn Waddaah (pg. 54))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaatibee (158) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed the saved sect – and they are Ahl-us-Sunnah – are commanded to disassociate themselves from the people of innovations, to expel them, and to punish severely anyone that follows in their direction, whether by killing them or less than that. And the scholars have warned us against accompanying and gathering with them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (the compiler) say : may Allaah have mercy on the Salaf (predecessors). They did not leave behind any person of innovation except that they subdued him and warned against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; for they would influence those whom they sat with, and their danger is great. There is no doubt that innovation is worse than sin and that the danger of the innovator is worse to the people than the danger of the sinner. &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the danger of the people of innovation, Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the danger of them [meaning the innovators], the Religion would have been corrupted. Their corruption is worse than the corruption caused by the conquering of the enemies at times of war. For indeed, when they conquer, they do not corrupt hearts or the Religion found in them, except for a while. But as for these people [i.e. the innovators], then they corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa: (28/232)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Ibn Taimiyyah) also said (20/103):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The people of innovation are worse than the people of lustful sins, according to the Sunnah and the Ijmaa’ (consensus).”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8211; This is why the Salaf would say:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Being moderate while upon the Sunnah is better than exerting oneself while upon Innovation.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This statement is reported from Ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him. Refer to Al-Laalikaa’ee (1/188, no. 114), Al-Ibaanah (1/320, no. 161) and As-Sunnah of Ibn Nasr (30).]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Abdullah b. Mas’ûd – Allah be pleased with him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The believer sees his sins as if he is sitting at the foot of a mountain fearing that it might fall on him, while the sinner (fâjir) sees his sins as a fly that lands on his nose, he just waves it away. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>î<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em>, <em>The Book of Supplications</em>, <em>Chapter on Tawbah</em>.</p>
<p>Ibn <span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ajr quotes in his commentary, <em>Fat<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> Al-Bârî</em>:Ibn Abî Jumrah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The reason for this [fear] is that the heart of a believer is illuminated; so when he sees from himself something that goes against what he illuminates his heart with, it is very distressing to him. The wisdom behind giving the example of a mountain is that a person might find some way to escape from other dangers, but if a mountain falls on a person he does not survive. In short, the believer is dominated by fear (of Allah) due to the strength of îmân he has; he does not therefore feel falsely secure about being punished because of his sins. This is the way of the Muslim: he always fears and checks on himself, his good deeds are little to him and he fears even the small bad deeds he has done.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>It’s just a small sin</strong></span></p>
<p>Bilâl b. Sa’d – Allah have mercy on him – said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008000;">Do not think about how small the sin is, but think about who you have just disobeyed.</span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A burglar scaled the wall of Maalik bin Dinar&#8217;s house one night and easily managed to get inside. Once inside the house, the thief was disappointed to see that there was nothing inside actually worth stealing. The owner of the home was inside at the time, he was busy performing prayer. Realizing that he was not alone, Maalik quickly ended his prayer and turned around to face the thief. Without showing any sign of being shocked or afraid, Maalik calmly extended greetings of peace and then said, &#8220;My brother, may Allah forgive you. You entered my home and found nothing that is worth taking, yet I do not want you to leave my home without taking away some benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stood up, went to another part of the room, and came back with a jug full of water. He looked into the eyes of the burglar and said, &#8220;Make ablution and perform two units of prayer, for if you do so, you will leave my home with a greater treasure than you had initially sought when you entered it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Much humbled by Maalik&#8217;s manners and words, the thief said, &#8220;Yes, that is a generous offer indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After making ablution and performing two units of prayer, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, would you mind if I stayed for a while, for I want to stay to perform two more units of prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Stay for whatever amount of prayer Allah decrees for you to perform now.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thief ended up spending the entire night at Maalik&#8217;s house. He continued to pray until the morning. Then Maalik said, &#8220;Leave now and be good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But instead of leaving, the thief said, &#8220;Would you mind if I stayed here with you today, for I have made an intention to fast the day?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Stay as long as you wish,&#8221; said Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The burglar ended up staying for a number of days, praying during the late hours of each night and fasting throughout the duration of each day. When he finally decided to leave, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, I have made a firm resolve to repent for my sins and for my former way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Indeed, that is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man did mend his ways and began to lead a life of righteousness and obedience to Allah. Later on, He came across another burglar he knew. [His friend] said to him, &#8220;Have you found your treasure yet?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;My brother, what I found is Maalik bin Dinaar. I went to steal from him, but it was he who ended up stealing my heart. I have indeed repented to Allah, and I will remain at the door [of His Mercy and Forgiveness] until I achieve what his obedient, loving slaves have achieved.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (rahimahullah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sin may be more beneficial for a person, <strong>if</strong> it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.&#8217;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;How is that?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation.<br />
And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sin may be the factor that leads him to do acts of worship and good deeds and to change his attitude so that he fears Allah and feels shy before Him and feels humiliated before Him, hanging his head in shame and weeping with regret, seeking he forgiveness of his Lord. Each of these effects is better for a person than an act of worship that makes him feel proud and show off and look down on people. Undoubtedly this sin is better before Allah and is more likely to bring salvation than one who admires himself and looks down on others, and who thinks that he is doing Allah a favour. Even if he says words that indicate something other than that, Allah is the Witness over what is in his heart. Such a person may feel hatred towards people if they do not hold him in high esteem and humiliate themselves before him. If he were to examine himself honestly, he would see that clearly.&#8221;</p>
