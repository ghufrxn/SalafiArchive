										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

<li style="text-align:justify;">Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Its trees should not be cut.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">No heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah,the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet peace be upon him said, “I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle , peace be upon him, “Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet , peace be upon him, said, “O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet , peace be upon him, said, “There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Umar ,radhi Allaahu anhu,said, “O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.”</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 30:</p>
<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Following is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah encouraged His Prophet to pray in Masjid Quba&#8217; which, from the first day, was built on Taqwa, obedience to Allah and His Messenger , for gathering the word of the believers and as an outpost and a fort for Islam and its people. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on Taqwa is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray).)</span></strong> in reference to the Masjid of Quba&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic Hadith records that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(One prayer in Masjid Quba&#8217; is just like an `Umrah.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah used to visit Masjid Quba&#8217; while riding and walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is prescribed for the visitor to Madeenah and for the one who lives there to go to the Mosque of Quba’ and pray there, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking the reward of ‘Umrah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It was narrated that Sahl ibn Haneef said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: </span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">“</b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque – meaning the Mosque of Quba’ – and prays there, that will be equivalent to ‘Umrah</span></strong></span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">.”</b><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Narrated by Ahmad, 3/437; al-Nasaa’i, 699; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in </span><i style="line-height:1.5em;">Saheeh al-Targheeb</i><span style="line-height:1.5em;">, 1180, 1181.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In </span><em style="line-height:1.5em;">Sahih Muslim </em><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> it is narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go to the mosque of Quba’ every Saturday, walking or riding, and he would pray two rak’ahs there</span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">.</b><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1191; Muslim, 1399</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The heart of the Prophet&#8217;s masjid houses a very special but small area named <i>ar-Rawdah an-Nabawiyah</i>, which extends from Muhammad&#8217;s tomb to his pulpit. Pilgrims attempt to visit and pray in ar-Rawdah, for there is a tradition that supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected. Entrance into <i>ar-Rawdah</i> is not always possible (especially during the Hajj season), as the tiny area can accommodate only a few hundred people. <i>Ar-Rawdah</i> has two small gateways manned by Saudi police officers. The current marble pulpit was constructed by the Ottomans. The original pulpit was much smaller than the current one, and constructed of palm tree wood, not marble. <i>Ar-Rawdah an-Nabawiyah</i> is considered part of Jannah (Heaven or Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for the one who visits the Prophet’s Mosque to pray two rak’ahs in the Rawdah or whatever he wants of naafil prayers, because it is proven that there is virtue in doing so. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <b>“The area between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens ( <i>riyaad</i>, sing. <i>rawdah</i>) of Paradise, and my minbar is on my cistern (<i>hawd</i>)” </b>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1196; Muslim, 1391.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was narrated that Yazeed ibn Abi ‘Ubayd said: <b>“I used to come with Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ and he would pray by the pillar which was by the mus-haf, i.e. in the Rawdah. I said, ‘O Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar!’ He said, ‘I saw that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to pray here.’”</b> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 502; Muslim, 509.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Being keen to pray in al-Rawdah does not justify being aggressive towards people or pushing the weak aside, or stepping over their necks. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women who want to pray in Rawdah area can enter the masjid through the Gates 21 &#8211; 25. Rawdah area for women is open after Fajr, Zuhr and Isha Prayers. It is open after Fajar for long time and 15 &#8211; 20 min after Zuhr prayer</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Ajwa Dates Keep Away Harm, Poison And Magic</h3>
<p>Ajwa (عجوة) is a soft dry variety of date fruit from Saudi Arabia. It is cultivated at Madina . A delightfully soft and fruity date with fine texture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Whoever has seven Ajwa dates every morning he will not be harmed on that day by poison or magic.” [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5445) (5768) (5769) (5779)].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1sS" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Term ‘al-Munawarah’</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘<strong>al-Mukkarama</strong>’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>
