										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Benefits Derived from the Story of Yusuf</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Chapter 1: The Dream of the Two Young Men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the dream of the two young men, where one of them said:</p>
<p><strong>وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ السِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ ۖ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَا إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا ۖ وَقَالَ الْآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزًا تَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘Verily, I saw myself </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a dream)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> pressing wine.’ The other said: ‘Verily, I saw myself </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a dream)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof.’ </span></strong> [Yusuf: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were kind to Yusuf so that he would inform them of the interpretation of their dream. This is due to what they witnessed of his being good to things and to the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf –alayhi sallam- interpreted the dream of the one who saw that he was pressing wine to be that he would be saved from the prison and would return to his status of serving his master, so he would press grapes for his master, resulting in wine. He interpreted the other dream to be that person being killed, then crucified and birds eating from his head. As for the first dream then it came in a literal form. As for the other dream, then it came in the form of a similitude; that he would be killed, and even though he would have been killed, he would still be crucified and would not be buried until birds had eaten from his head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an amazing insight, which gives precise meanings, as it is the custom that a person who is killed is buried straight away, such that it would not be possible for beasts and birds to eat from him. However, Yusuf –alayhi sallam- understood that this person would be killed and not buried quickly so that he reached this state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the humiliation of that man, and his despicable, evil worldly destiny which causes the skin to tremble. He knew that this dream was real and would definitely take place. Yusuf said to them:</p>
<p><strong>قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ الَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ<br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.’</strong></span> [Yusuf: 41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from his complete knowledge of interpreting dreams, which are not interpreted based on suspicion and delusion, rather they are interpreted upon knowledge and certainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the appropriateness of the interpretation of this dream, it is that birds do not come close to living things, rather they eat from the deceased if there is no one close to the dead body, and this takes place after the person has been killed and crucified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the perfection of Yusuf, his advice and his amazing intelligence is that he was careful in interpreting their dreams when they narrated them to him and he promised them that he would interpret the dreams at the earliest time. Yusuf said:</p>
<p><strong>لَا يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلَّا نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No food will come to you </strong>(in wakefulness or in a dream) <strong>as your provision, but I will inform </strong>(in wakefulness)<strong> its interpretation before it </strong>(the food) <strong>comes</strong></span>. [Yusuf: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He promised them the interpretations before the first meal was to be brought for them from outside the prison so that they would be calm and eager to hear the interpretations. Yusuf did this so he would be able to give them Da’wah before he gave them the interpretations so that they would be more receptive to accepting the Da’wah to Allaah because calling them to Allaah was more important than interpreting their dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called them to Allaah using two means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Firstly:</strong></span> through his own self, in how he was and in his beautiful description that made him reach this noble station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf –alayhim as-Salaam- said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِي رَبِّي ۚ إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ مَا كَانَ لَنَا أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِاللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This is of that which my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have abandoned the religion of a people that do not believe in Allaah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter</strong> (i.e. the Kan&#8217;âniun of Egypt who were polytheists and used to worship the sun and other false deities)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘And I have followed the religion of my fathers, &#8211; Ibraheem, Ishaaq and Ya’qoob, and never could we attribute any partners whatsoever to Allaah. This is from the Grace of Allaah to us and to mankind, but most men are not thankful.</strong></span>[Yusuf: 37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second matter:</strong></span> He called them through natural, real evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said :</p>
<p><strong>يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p><strong>مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ ۚ أَمَرَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘O two companions of the prison! Are many different lords </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(gods)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> better or Allaah, the One, the Irresistible? ‘You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(forged),</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(or the judgement)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(true)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> straight religion, but most men do not know.</span></strong>  [Yusuf: 39-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed The One who is singled out with perfection from all angles, and with complete control over all the world, the upper and the lower, The One Who is deserving of complete worship, Who created the creation for His worship and He ordered them to do it, He has the command over His slaves in this world and the Hereafter. He is the One Whom it is necessary to worship Alone, other than Whom there are things that are worshipped which are deficient and of different types &#8211; those things which many people claim divinity for, but they do not have anything of the real meaning of divinity nor are they deserving of worship, rather they are titles which they have defined and names without any meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Yusuf saw that calling them to Allaah was foremost rather than the interpretation of their dreams and it was more beneficial for them and other than them.</p>

Chapter 130<br />
Visions in Dream and matters relating to them</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And among His Signs is your sleep by night and by day.&#8221;</b></span><b> (30:23)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>838.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;All that is left from Prophethood is the glad tidings.</span>&#8221; He was asked what the glad tidings were, and he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The good dream.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>839.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When the time draws near (i.e., near the end of the world), the dream of a believer can hardly be false; and the dream of a believer represents one part from forty-six parts of Prophethood.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One narration says: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The most truthful of you in their speech are those who see the truest visions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>840.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who sees me in his dream will see me in his wakefulness (or he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) may have said it is as though he has seen me in a state of wakefulness), for Satan does not appear in my form.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim ].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>841.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you sees a dream that he likes, then it is from Allah. He should praise Allah for it and relate it to (others).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration adds: Messenger of Allah(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He should not report it except to those whom he loves. And if he sees one which he dislikes, then it is from the Satan. He should seek refuge in Allah against its evil and should not mention it to anyone. Then it will not harm him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>842.</b> Abu Qatadah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A good vision (dream) is from Allah and a bad dream is from the Satan. He who sees something in a dream that he dislikes, should blow thrice on his left, must seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from the evil of the Satan (i.e., by saying: A`udhu billahi minash-Shaitanir-Rajim). Then it will not harm him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>843.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you sees a bad dream let him blow three times on his left, seek refuge in Allah from the Satan three times (i.e., by saying: A`udhu billahi minash-Shaitanir-Rajim) and change the side on which he was lying.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>844.</b> Wathilah bin Al-Asqa` (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Of the worst lies are: to claim a false father, or to pretend to have seen what one has not seen (tell a false dream), or to attribute to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) what he has not said.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

So when one of. you sees a bad dream (hulm) which he does not like, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from its evil; then it will not harm him.</p>

And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings from Allah; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan; and the third one is a suggestion of one&#8217;s own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should stand tip and offer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and he said: I would love to see fetters (in the dream), but I dislike wearing of necklace, for the fetters is (an indication of) one&#8217;s steadfastness in religion.

Then the person after you would take hold of it and he would also climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and climb up with the help of it. Then another person would take hold of it and it would be broken; then it would be rejoined for him and he would climb up with the help of it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger, may my father be taken as a ransom for you, tell me whether I have interpreted it currectly or I have made an error. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: You have interpreted a part of it correctly and you have erred in interpreting a part of it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.087.111">Volume 9, Book 87, Number 111: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream  but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira  where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take  with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take  his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended  upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to  read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; (The Prophet added),  &#8220;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it  anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read,&#8221; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I  could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I  replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&#8221; Thereupon he  caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &#8220;Read: In  the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot.  Read and Your Lord is Most Generous&#8230;up to&#8230;.. ..that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.15) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his  neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &#8220;Cover me!  Cover me!&#8221; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &#8220;O Khadija,  what is wrong with me?&#8221; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &#8216;I  fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija said, &#8216;Never! But have the glad  tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your  Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest  generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; Khadija then  accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza bin Qusai.  Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&#8217;s brother, who during the  Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to  write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and  had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your  nephew.&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet  described whatever he had seen. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel,  the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and  could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked, &#8220;Will they turn me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said:  &#8220;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated  with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I  would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard  that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every  time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear  before him and say, &#8220;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&#8217;s Apostle in truth&#8221;  whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And  whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as  before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him  and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn &#8216;Abbas said regarding the meaning of: &#8216;He it  is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)&#8217; (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of  the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night). </font></p>

So, if someone has a dream which he  dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer.&#8221; He added,  &#8220;He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in a dream)  and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet  symbolizes one&#8217;s constant and firm adherence to religion.&#8221; And Abu &#8216;Abdullah said,  &#8220;Ghuls (iron collars) are used only for necks.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Al-&#8216;Ala an Ansari woman who had given the Pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;&#8216;Uthman bin Maz&#8217;un came in our share when the  Ansars drew lots to distribute the emigrants (to dwell) among themselves, He became sick  and we looked after (nursed) him till he died. Then we shrouded him in his clothes.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us, I (addressing the dead body) said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Mercy be  on you, O Aba As-Sa&#8217;ib! I testify that Allah has honored you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;How  do you know that?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I do not know, by Allah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for him, death has  come to him and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I  neither know what will happen to me, nor to you.'&#8221; Um Al-&#8216;Ala said, &#8220;By Allah, I  will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.&#8221; She added, &#8220;Later I  saw in a dream, a flowing spring for &#8216;Uthman. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned  that to him. He said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his good deeds (the reward for) which is  going on for him.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Men from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to see  dreams during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they used to narrate those dreams to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would interpret them as Allah wished. I was a young man  and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, &#8220;If there were  any good in myself, I too would see what these people see.&#8221; So when I went to bed one  night, I said, &#8220;O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream.&#8221; So  while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each  of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was  between them, invoking Allah, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with You from Hell.&#8221; Then  I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said  to me, &#8220;Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more  often.&#8221; So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was  built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post  there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down  with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels)  took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No doubt, &#8216;Abdullah is a good man.&#8221;  (Nafi&#8217; said, &#8220;Since then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to pray much.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young unmarried man during the lifetime of the  Prophet. I used to sleep in the mosque. Anyone who had a dream, would narrate it to the  Prophet. I said, &#8220;O Allah! If there is any good for me with You, then show me a dream  so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may interpret it for me.&#8221; So I slept and saw (in a dream) two  angels came to me and took me along with them, and they met another angel who said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, you are a good man.&#8221; They took me towards the Fire, and  behold, it was built inside like a well, and therein I saw people some of whom I  recognized, and then the angels took me to the right side. In the morning, I mentioned  that dream to Hafsa. Hafsa told me that she had mentioned it to the Prophet and he said,  &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah is a righteous man if he only prays more at night.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said,  &#8220;After that, &#8216;Abdullah used to pray more at night.&#8221;) </font></p>

I thought that it might  be the land of Al-Yamama or Hajar, but behold, it turned out to be Yathrib (i.e. Medina).  And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Allah is better (than  worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed)  on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good  and the reward and the truth which Allah bestowed upon us after the Badr battle. (or the  Battle of Uhud) and that was the victory bestowed by Allah in the Battle of Khaibar and  the conquest of Mecca) . </font></p>

And behold, there was  a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you (the Prophet) held it and  went up, and then another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third) held it  and went up, and then after another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got  connected again.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

You follow it and Allah will  raise you high with it, and then another man will follow it and will rise up with it and  another person will follow it and then another man will follow it but it will break and  then it will be connected for him and he will rise up with it.

By the time he reached the man,  his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done  before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?&#8217; They said,  &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man  standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of  the man&#8217;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly  tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the  other side of the man&#8217;s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly  completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to  it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are  these two persons?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came across something  like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&#8221; I  think the Prophet said, &#8220;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame  of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly.  I asked them, &#8216;Who are these?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; And so we proceeded and came  across a river.&#8221; I think he said, &#8220;&#8230;. red like blood.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man  who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him.  The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth  whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated,  I asked my two companions, &#8216;Who are these (two) persons?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed!  Proceed!&#8217; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most  repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was  kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &#8216;Who is this (man)?&#8217; They said  to me, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense  vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very  tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there  were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &#8216;Who  is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic  huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &#8216;Go  up and I went up&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;So we ascended till we reached a city built of  gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the  gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of  their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side  as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to  throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and  its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then  returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the  best shape.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;My two companions (angels) said to me,  &#8216;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&#8217; I raised up my sight, and  behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &#8216;That  (palace) is your place.&#8217; I said to them, &#8216;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to  them, &#8216;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being  injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither  recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the  man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to  back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so  many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw  in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and  the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of  usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going  round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is  Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic  Faith).&#8221; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What about the children of pagans?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;And also the children  of pagans.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;My two companions added, &#8216;The men you saw half  handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another  that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>

</header>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh, hafidhahullah, gave us a summarized explanation of the hadith narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub when he said that that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often used to ask his companions, ‘Did any one of you see a  dream?’ So dreams would be described to him by those who Allaah willed should speak. One morning, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Last night, two men came to me and said to me, &#8216;Let us go!&#8217;, and I set out with them&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh also gave us some general advice regarding dreams, wajazaahum Allahu khairan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the interpretation of seeing a deceased every time in dreams?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one sees a deceased in a good state in a dream, this lends hope that he is in a good state. If one sees him in another type of state, this could simply be devils taking on the form of people. Devils take on the shapes of people in a disliked situation in order to grieve the living. This is because devils are very avaricious to do anything that brings grief, worry and sadness to the believers. Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Secret counsels are only from Satan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits&#8221;</span></strong> (al-Mujadalah 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person sees something evil for a deceased in a dream, he must seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. He should not communicate that dream to anyone concerning that deceased. In that way, the deceased will not harm whatsoever. In fact, any time a person sees something disturbing in a dream, he should then seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. Then he should spit three times on his left side. He should then change his side upon which he was sleeping to the other side. If he makes ablution and prays, that is better and superior. He should not communicate that dream to anyone and, in that case, he will not be harmed by it at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><br />
Q: There is a frightening nightmare haunting me frequently. While sleeping I dream that there is something within my mouth resembling dough. It makes it difficult for me to breathe and speak. Many times I try to remove or take out of it with my hand but it comes again, which breaks my sleep. I am frightened of this nightmare that disturbed my life and obsessed my thinking. I do not know the reason behind this, knowing that I observe performing Prayer and Fast and performed Pilgrimage. I often ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness and repent to Him. Yet it haunts me within a period of two, four, or five months. I ask Allah (Exalted be He) that you will give me an explanation for this frightening dream. May Allah guide you to what brings out the good of this life and the Hereafter. Allah is in the help of a servant as long as he is in the help of his brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This nightmare is from Satan. It is ordained for you and for every Muslim man and woman seeing what he hates to spit dryly to his left side thrice and to seek refuge with Allah from Satan and from the evil of what he saw (three times). Then he should resume sleeping on the other side. This way, what he sees cannot harm him. One should not tell anyone about this because it was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;A good dreamis from Allah and a bad dream is from Satan. Anyone who sees something (in a dream) that they hate, should spit to their left three times and seek refuge with Allah three times from the evil of Satan and of what they have seen. Then they should turn on the other side and it will not harm them. They should tell no one about ii.&#8221;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic Hadith relieves both the believing man and woman seeing what they hate. Praise be to Allah, it is a great remedy available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, you should put this into action and relieve your heart with this Prophetic remedy. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hirrahamanirraheem , Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil Aalameen</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We begin by relating to you the story of the just king Nooruddin Mahmoud zunki , May Allah’s mercy be upon him, that took place in the year 557 after hijra. He was ruling the Greater Syria area and he saw a magnificent dream, which made him go to the city of Madina. He saw Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam three times in one night and in every time Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam telling him O’ Mahmoud save me from these two individuals while pointing towards to blond individuals in front of him. So the king summoned his minister before dawn and told him about this so the minister said this is a matter which may have taken place in Madina, the Madina of Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he prepared himself and quickly hastened over 1000 mounts and horses and other than that until he entered in Madina quietly and secretly with his minster and he came to Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s masjid not knowing what to do. So the minister said do you recognize these two individuals if you see them ?. He said yes .So he summoned the people to give them charity and distributed to them plenty of gold and silver and he said that no one in Madina should stay except, known in madina should stay but rather should come to receive the charity. Only two people didn’t come to collect the Sadaqa. They remained close by the masjid from Andulisya (currently Spain), in a place which in the direction of the qibla from the side of the apartment of Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam close to the house of Umar Ibn Al Khattab that is where they stayed so they came or he summoned them to come for the sadqa, they refused and they said that “what we have is sufficient. We don’t accept anything”. So he stressed they should come and insisted and so they were brought. When the minister saw them, he said to him are they the same individuals? So he asked them on their condition and what brought them here .they said “we came to be close by the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasalam” . He said you should speak the truth and repeated the question several times until <strong>they confessed that they were christians and that they were on a mission to remove the body of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam </strong>in agreement with their teams and he found that they dug a tunnel from the side of the qibla by the wall of the masjid in the direction of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s apartment and they collected the dust of the soil in a well inside their residence. So he beheaded them outside the masjid and returned to as shams and he commanded that the area around the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s site of burial be dug and he commanded that lead be poured around lest some enemies or to prevent anyone from reaching Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s site of burial .</p>
