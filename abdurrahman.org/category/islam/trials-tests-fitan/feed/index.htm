<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Necessity of approaching Allah with Tawbah and supplication in adversity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdul­‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baz to every Muslim who reads this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us remember Him and take warnings and lessons from the destinies unfolding before our eyes and lead us to sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from all sins and misdeeds. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) wills with His Deep Wisdom, absolute Proof, and all­ Encompassing Knowledge to test His Servants with prosperity and adversity, poverty and affluence, blessings and calamities, to try their patience and thankfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who is patient at the time of adversity, thankful at the time of prosperity, humbles themselves and supplicates to Allah upon facing hardships, acknowledges their sins and shortcomings, and asks Allah for His Mercy and Forgiveness, has succeeded and will be granted the blessed end. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif­ Lâm ­Mîm.</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings.]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allâh will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the truth of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are true, and will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the falsehood of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are liars, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test)</span><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitnah (trial) mentioned in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse) means the test of faith that makes evident the truthful from the liar, the patient and the thankful, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have made some of you as a trial for others: will you have patience? And your Lord is Ever All­ Seer (of everything)</span></strong>&#8220;. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We tried them with good </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(blessings) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(calamities)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in order that they might turn</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (to Allâh’s Obedience)</span>&#8220;. The good refers here to the blessings of fertility, prosperity, good health, honor, victory over enemies, and the like, while the evil here are adversities, such as diseases, domination of the enemy, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, torrential destructive floods, and the like. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(sins and disobedience to Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by oppression and evil deeds)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, that He</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by repenting to Allâh, and begging His Pardon)</span>&#8220;. This means that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined the good and the evil and the occurrence of corruption for people to return to Al-­Haqq (the Truth), to hurry and make Tawbah from what Allah has forbidden them, and hasten to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kufr (disbelief) and sins are the cause of all afflictions and evil in this world and the Hereafter, while tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and Iman (belief) in Him and His Messengers, obedience to Him and His Messengers, holding fast to His Shari‘ah (Islamic law), Da‘wah (calling) people to it, and refuting those who oppose it, are the causes of all good in this world and in the Hereafter. Perseverance on these principles and enjoining and cooperating in them bring honor in this world and the Hereafter, and salvation from every evil and protection from every Fitnah (trial). Allah (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you help </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the cause of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. And He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(may He be Praised) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">says: Verily, Allâh will help those who help His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Cause)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Truly, Allâh is All ­Strong, All ­Mighty</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span>. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat­ as­Salât [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al­ Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures). He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) explains in many Ayahs that the afflictions and exemplary punishments that befell the preceding nations, such as floods, devastating winds, the mighty shriek, and being swallowed up by the earth, and the like, were nothing more than the result of their Kufr and sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We sent Hâsib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lût (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As­-Saihah [torment ­ awful cry. (as Thamûd or Shu‘aib’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qârûn (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nûh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allâh Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised and Exalted) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> (See the Qur’ân Verse 35:45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah orders His Servants to turn to Him in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and supplicate to Him at the time of adversity, as He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful He (may He be Praised) &#8220;</span></strong> also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad ىلص ملـسو هـيلع اللها). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility). When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this glorious Ayah, Allah urges His Slaves and awakens in them the desire that, when they face adversities, such as illness, wounds, fighting, earthquakes, winds, storms, and other tribulations, they should humble themselves to Him in need of Him and ask for His Help. This is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)?</span></strong>&#8221; It asks why they (the preceding nations) did not turn to Allah humbly when they were inflicted with torment. Allah then tells that their hard­ heartedness and the handiwork of Satan, making evil deeds pleasing to them, prevented them from Tawbah, supplication, and beseeching forgiveness. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Rightly ­Guided Caliph, Amir Al ­Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers), ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul­‘Aziz (may Allah be merciful to him), when there was an earthquake during his era, wrote to his agents in the different countries and ordered them to tell the Muslims to make Tawbah to Allah, humble themselves to Him, and seek His Forgiveness from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All you Muslims know the different types of Fitan (trials) and calamities that prevail in our time, among which is the that the Kafirs have power over the Muslims in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, Palestine, Lebanon, Ethiopia, and other countries. There have also been earthquakes in Yemen and many countries; devastating floods, and violent hurricanes that have destroyed homes, trees, ships, and other properties; avalanches that have brought about incalculable harm; and famines and droughts in a multitude of countries. All this and much more are the different types of punishment that Allah afflicts upon His Servants due to their Kufr and misdeeds, deviation from His Obedience, zeal for this world and its transient pleasures, and turning away from the Hereafter and failing to prepare for it; except those to whom Allah has shown His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that all such adversities obligate Allah’s Servants to hasten to make sincere Tawbah to Him (may He be Praised) from all that He prohibited them from, to return to His Obedience, to rule according to the Shari‘ah (Islamic law), to cooperate in righteousness and piety, and advise one another to adhere to the truth and have patience. The moment the Servants repent to their Lord, humble themselves to Him, and hasten to do what pleases Him: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety)</span></strong> and enjoin one another to do good and forbid one another from evil, Allah will set their affairs aright and ward off the evil of their enemies, grant them authority in the land, give them victory over their enemies, bestow upon them His Blessings, and protect them from His Punishment. Allah, the Truest Speaker, says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good­ doers&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(commanding you)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding Grace to every owner of grace (i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving, physically and with his wealth, and even with good words). But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. the Day of Resurrection)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As­Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All­ Mighty, All­ Wise&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies in these Ayahs that His Mercy, Benevolence, Protection, and all His other Blessings are granted in full and shall continue to be given in the Hereafter to those who fear Him, believe in Him, obey His Messengers, hold fast to His Shar‘iah (Islamic Law), and make Tawbah to Him from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But for those who shun His Obedience, are too proud to fulfill the Rights owed to Him, and persist in their Kufr and disobedience, Allah (may He be Praised) threatens them with different punishments in this life and the Hereafter, and shall expedite the share of punishment which He has allotted for them (in this world. ed.), as His wisdom dictates, for them to be an example and warning to others. Allah (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. So the root of the people who did wrong was cut off. And all the praises and thanks are to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims! Call yourselves to account for your deeds, make Tawbah to your Lord, and seek His Forgiveness. Hasten to obedience and be on your guard against disobedience, and cooperate in righteousness and piety. Do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. Be just; indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. Make provision of righteous acts before death befalls you. Show mercy to the weak, help the poor, increase your Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), ask for His Forgiveness, enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil that you may receive mercy. Take admonition from what happened to the preceding nations due to their sins and misdeeds. Indeed, Allah accepts the Tawbah of the penitent, shows mercy to the doers of good, and grants a blessed end to the pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-­Muttaqûn (the pious) And He (Exalted be He) says: Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)</span></strong>. (See the footenote of V.9:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah with His Most Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to show mercy to the Muslims, grant them understanding of the Din (religion), give them victory over His and their enemies among the Kafirs and hypocrites, afflicting them with His Wrath that never will be turned back from the wrongdoers. He is the Guardian and the One Who is Capable of doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 68 : Point 114</b><br />
<b>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</b></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <i>rahimahullaah</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">When discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>al-fitnah</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">) occurs, then remain within your house </b></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;"> and flee from proximity of discord (</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah)</i></b><b style="color:#993300;">. And beware of </b><i><b style="color:#993300;">asabiyyah</b></i><b style="color:#993300;"> (bigoted fanaticism) and all fighting that </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>occurs</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> between the Muslims for this worldly life, then it is discord (</b><i style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">fitnah</i><b style="color:#993300;">). So fear and be dutiful to Allah, He Who is Alone, having no partner. And do not go out in it, and do not fight in it, do not fall into it, do not take sides, and do not incline towards one side and do not love anything from their affairs, since it is said, “</b><b style="color:#993300;"><i>He who loves the actions of a people, </i></b><span style="color:#993300;"><i><b>whether</b></i></span><i><b style="color:#993300;"> they are good or bad, will be just like the one who did them</b></i><b style="color:#993300;">.” May Allah guide us and you to those things that are pleasing to Him and keep us and you away from the acts of disobedience to Him.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>NOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] Ibn az-Zubayr (<i>radi Allaahu anhu</i>) narrates: My close friend, Abul-Qaasim (<i>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</i>) advised me,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><b>If you reach anything of the tumult (</b><b><i>fitnah</i></b><b>), go to Uhud and blunt your sword upon it, then remain in your house</b></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad (4/226 and 5/69). Its <i>isnaad</i> is <i>hasan</i>, as has been mentioned by Shaikh al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) in as-Saheehah (3/no.1373).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 62</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when a man becomes ill, Allaah gives him reward for his illness.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378202253&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-causes-afflictions-to-strike-the-believers-to-purify-them-multiply-their-reward" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not allow the reward due to the believers to become lost and He causes afflictions to strike the believers in order to <strong>purify them</strong> or to <strong>multiply their reward</strong>. He may cause calamities to happen to the believer to wipe away his sins and to purify him from sins. And it may be the case that he does not have sins but He still causes them to happen to him in order to raise his ranks in the Hereafter because Allaah has written for him a high rank in Paradise, which he cannot reach through his deeds. So, therefore Allaah tries him with afflictions so that He multiplies the reward for him so that he can reach this level. So the believer is upon good and therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“How amazing is the matter of the believer, all of his matters are good for him. If something pleasing comes upon him then he gives thanks and that will be good for him and if something harmful comes to him then he has patience (<u>s</u>abr) and that will be good for him and that will not be except for the believer (mu&#8217;min).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed the believer is struck by afflictions and they are something beneficial for him for either Allaah will wipe away his sins with them or otherwise Allaah will raise his rank on account of them.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,999) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Suhayb <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge mentioned that if a person is struck by affliction and he has patience upon it then he is rewarded. And if he doesn’t have patience, shows displeasure and the like then that’s something different. W`Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Read the Transcribed Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Hamdulillaah</em> (all praise is due to Allaah), the Most High, the One who said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to the patient ones. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221; They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah al-Baqarah (2:155-157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May the <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> of Allaah be upon His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم : <em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>), the one who was tried and tested in various ways and who was patient and persevered. And may Allaah’s (سبحانه و تعالى : <em>subhannahu wa ta’ala</em>) <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> be upon his household, the noble companions who also were also tested and tried, as well as upon the righteous predecessors and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Nature of Tests and Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that this life is filled with calamities, tests, and trials and that every believer will be subjected to many of these. Sometimes these trials are within himself, sometimes with his wealth and sometimes with his loved ones. These preordained trials and calamities, from the One who is All-Wise, will touch the believer in various ways and manners; if the believer does not have the correct view regarding the matter of testing, then he may err seriously, especially since some of the calamities are painful and profound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people are negligent about the wisdoms behind trials and testing; they may not understand that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) does not test us as a punishment, but rather as a mercy. The believer should look at the matter of <em>ibtilaa</em>’ (testing and trials) through the textual proofs in the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) so that he can stand on a firm ground regarding these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, life is a test and a trial; we are tested everyday in this life. Our wealth is a test; the spouse is a test; the children are tests; poverty and wealth are tests, and likewise health and illnesses are tests. We are tested in everything we possess and in that which we encounter in this life until we meet Allaah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ ۗ وَنَبْلُوكُم بِالشَّرِّ وَالْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً ۖ وَإِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone is going to taste death, and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good, and to Us you will be returned.</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-Anbiyaa’ (21:35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوا أَن يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ ۖ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَاذِبِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allaah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allaah knows all that before putting them to test).</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-‘Ankabut (29:2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the one who is healthy is tested, and also, the one who is ill is tested. The one who is healthy may not know this until he is touched by a trial, and the one who is ill will may not feel that he is in a testing situation until he is cured. No one is safe from trials because of their prestige or status; such things do not safeguard us from the tests as proven by the <em>hasan</em> (good) <em>hadith</em> in which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The people who receive the severest trial are the Prophets, then those most like them and then those most like them.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhi, hadith no. 2400 and ibn Maajah, hadith no. 4023; at-Tirmidhi said &#8220;hasan-saheeh; authenticated by Ibn al-Qayyim (Tareequl Hijratayen, p. 226), Ahmad Shaakir (Musnad Ahmad 3/52), and al-Albaani (see as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, p.19).]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Response of the Believer to Tests and Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst us, there is no one who possesses the ability to reject the tests, but there are those who are tested and succeed through good faith in Allaah, patient persevering, and by anticipating Allaah&#8217;s reward. Also, amongst us are those who are tested but fail because of weak faith and objection to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى); we seek refuge in Allaah from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“As long as people are in a state of good welfare, then once they are tested, they will return to their reality. The believer will go to his faith, and the hypocrite will go to his hypocrisy.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) preordained everything for us including our sustenance and our lifespan. He (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world&#8221;</em> </span><br />
[Surah az-Zukhruf (43:32)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sustenance and livelihood are preordained in certain measures; illness is preordained, and one’s welfare is preordained; everything in this life is preordained. The person should accept what Allaah has preordained for him and should not hate, dislike, or show discomfort towards these preordainments. Since this is the nature of the matter, one should submit his entire affair to Allaah and know that whatever befalls him will not miss him and whatever misses him will not befall him. It is as if the one who prefers this life to be monotonic wants the predecree of Allaah to be in accordance with his desires, and this is wishful thinking. Irrespective of the preordinance or test, it is a matter that is good for the believer; however, this is with the condition that one gives thanks for Allaah’s favor and is patient, as in the authentic hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Amazing is the matter of the believers, his affair to him is all good, and this is for none except for the believer, if he is touched by something good and then he thanks, then this is good for him. And if he is touched by a calamity or hardship, then he is patient and this is good for him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 2999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good.&#8221;</span> </em>&#8211; Surah an-Nisa (4:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ۖ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تُحِبُّوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.</em></span> &#8211; Surah al-Baqarah (2:216)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone should know that the One who tests us is also the One who bestows favors upon us. Furthermore, we should know that not everything we dislike is to be disliked in reality and that not everything that we desire is really beneficial for us; Allaah knows and you do not know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf (<em>rahimahumullaah</em>) said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If you were afflicted by a calamity, and you were patient, then your calamity is one; however, if you were impatient, then your calamity is double because of the loss of the reward as well as the beloved one, the Hereafter (i.e. Paradise). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was in relation to what Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) mentioned in Surah al-Hajj (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ حَرْفٍ ۖ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ ۖ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انقَلَبَ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةَ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And among mankind is he who worships Allaah as it were, upon the very edge (i.e. in doubt); if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face. He loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss.&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-Hajj (22:11)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Rewards Associated with Tests and Trials</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, testing is a station for a while, which will erase the sins. The sins will be removed as the leaves of a tree fall down, as in the ahaadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri and Abu Hurairah (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhumaa) from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim even if it were the prick he receives from a thorn but that Allaah expiates some of his sins for that.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5641 &amp; 5642 respectively]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) also narrated that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If Allaah wants to do good for somebody, He afflicts him with trials.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5645]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I visited the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) during his ailments, and he was suffering from a high fever. I said, ‘You have a high fever. Is it because you will have a double reward for it?’ He said, ‘Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any harm but that Allaah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5647]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward is affirmed regarding every kind of harm or hurt, tangible or intangible, if the believer is patiently persevering and anticipates the reward. It was reported by Anas ibn Maalik (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) that he heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah said, ‘If I deprive my slave of his two beloved things (i.e. his eyes) and he remains patient, I will let him enter Paradise in compensation for them.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tests and trials remove sins from the believers of the children of Adam, and all of the children of Adam commit sins. The tests and trials can also raise one to a higher degree in Paradise. It is reported that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says to His angels when they take the soul of a person’s child, ‘You took the fruit of his heart.’ They (the angels) say, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah says, ‘What did My slave say (upon that)?’ They say, ‘He praised you and made <em>istirjaa</em>’ (meaning he said, <em>Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon</em>’ &#8211; verily to Allaah we belong and to Him we shall return). So Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says, ‘Build for My slave a house in Paradise and name it the house of praise.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his musnad and graded hasan (good) by Shaykh al-Albaani].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said in the authentic hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“No Muslim is hurt by a thorn or something greater than a thorn except that Allaah elevates him in rank or effaces his sins because of that.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 6238]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer’s degree will be raised until he reaches his final degree in Paradise; this will be due to his patience and more importantly because of the favor of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى). Allaah, the Most High, said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى الصَّابِرُونَ أَجْرَهُم بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</span> </em>&#8211; Surah az-Zumar (39:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calamities, trials, and tests are signs of Allaah’s love for the believer. Indeed, they are like a cure; although it may be bitter, we accept them since they are from the One whom we love, and to Allaah belongs the best example. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The greatest reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allaah loves a people, He tests them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure, but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhi (2396) and ibn Maajah (4031). Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) considered it hasan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The <em>ibtilaa</em>’ (testing) of the believer is like medicine for him. It extracts from him the illnesses which if they had remained, would destroy him or diminish his reward and level. The tests and the trials extract these illnesses from him and prepare him for the perfect reward and the highness of degree.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ighaathatul Lahfan, p. 286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, the affliction by test and trials is better to the believer than punishment in the Hereafter, and in that, there is an elevation of his rank and expiation for his sins. Therefore, it is better for him. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When Allaah wills good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for him in this world, and when Allaah wills ill for His slave, he withholds the punishment for his sins from him until he comes with all his sins on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhi (2396) and Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) classified it as saheeh (authentic) in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahlul-‘Ilm (the people of knowledge) made it clear that this hadith refers to the hypocrites; Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) withholds the punishment from them in this life in order to give them their full account on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Lessons of the Tests and Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the test and trials, there are lessons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first lesson</strong> is that tests and trials are beneficial to the believer’s tawheed (worship of Allaah), imaan (Faith), and tawakkul (reliance upon Allaah). They force mankind to examine the reality that they are in fact a weak creation who has no power or strength, except in their Lord, Allaah. As such, we should resort to Him and depend upon Him, at which point arrogance, false pride, puffing, and negligence will be removed. We will come to know that we are really poor and in need of our Creator, the Almighty, the Most Perfect, so that we resort to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second lesson</strong> is that the tests unravel the reality of this life. They show that this life is a temporal stay for amusement, and the perfect life is the one after that, where there is no toil, worry, fatigue, or disease. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا هَٰذِهِ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا لَهْوٌ وَلَعِبٌ ۚ وَإِنَّ الدَّارَ الْآخِرَةَ لَهِيَ الْحَيَوَانُ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And this life of the world is only amusement and play! Verily, the home of the Hereafter, that is the life indeed (i.e. the eternal life that will never end), if they but knew&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-‘Ankabut (29:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even with amusement and play, there is also toil and fatigue. This is the reality of this life; one day it smiles at you, and the next day it turns its back to you. This is its nature, but man forgets that. Therefore, the trials and tests come, and they make the person understand the nature of this life and that he should not attach himself to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third lesson</strong> is that the test and trials remind the person of Allaah’s favor upon him and how this is only a transitional existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth lesson</strong> is that they remind us that we should not be in such a state of joy that we feel arrogant. Likewise, we should not be in such a state of sadness and grief that one feels despair. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لِّكَيْلَا تَأْسَوْا عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلَا تَفْرَحُوا بِمَا آتَاكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (al-Lauh al-Mahfuz), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allaah. In order that you may not be sad over matters that you fail to get, nor rejoice because of that which has been given to you. And Allaah likes not prideful boasters.</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-Hadid (57:22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth lesson</strong> is that trials and tests remind the person of his shortcomings and defects so that he can repent from them. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ ۚ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a Messenger to mankind, and Allaah is Sufficient as a Witness</span></em>. &#8211; Surah an-Nisa (4:79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, He (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much</em></span>. &#8211; Surah ash-Shura (42:30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, there is still chance for repentance before the greater torment may occur. In addition, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَدْنَىٰ دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment (i.e. the torment in the life of this world, i.e. disasters, calamities, etc.) prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may (repent and) return (i.e. accept Islam).</em> </span>&#8211; Surah as-Sajdah (32:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lesser torment in this life is calamities, disasters, and hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The sixth lesson</strong> is that test and trials are a great teaching process whereby the person learns to become patient. We cannot stand on the truth and obedience, except with patience, and we cannot stay away from falsehood, except with patient perseverance regarding disobedience; we cannot walk the paths of this life, except with patience regarding the preordinances of Allaah. The outcome is jannat al-khuld war-ridwan (endless bliss in Paradise and the pleasure of Allaah). Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) mentioned (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا الَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of the happiness in the Hereafter i.e. Paradise and in this world of a high moral character)</em></span>. Surah al-Fussilat (41:35)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if a calamity befalls us and we pass it, then we have learned the lessons. The Salaf (rahimahumullaah) more appropriately dealt with tests and trials than us. They left magnificent examples of patience in anticipation of reward. It is reported that ‘Umar (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) used to praise Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) for the test and trials. When he was asked about it, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I was never touched by a test, except that Allaah bestowed four favors upon me; they (the favors) were that the test was not one in my deen (religion), was not greater than me, was not greater than what befell me, and I was not deprived of contentment and patience, and I hoped for the reward of Allaah for it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we should not forget that in the test there is a reward, and it cannot be attained except with patience and that patience cannot be attained except with a strong will and faith. We should not forget to remember Allaah, being thankful for His favors and be patient with His tests and trials. Let this be a sincere and hidden matter between us and our Rubb (Lord) because He knows and He sees; He is more Merciful to us than ourselves and of all of mankind, so we should turn our affairs to Him. As the poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If you complain to the son of Adam, it is like you are complaining to the one who has no mercy towards you.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should not forget that if we are touched by a calamity, then we should praise Allaah and be thankful that He did not touch us with something more intense and far greater. Whatever befalls us is not going to miss us, and whatever has missed us is not going to befall us. The magnitude of reward is proportionate to the magnitude of testing and to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is that which He gives and to Him is that which He takes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Leave complaints and discontentment because it will not help, rather it will magnify our calamity and causes us to miss the reward and subject us to being held sinful. Let each of us remember that no matter the magnitude of the calamity that may befall us, it will not reach the level of the calamity which touched the entire Ummah because of the loss of its beloved one, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), who reminded of this when he stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If any one of you is touched by a calamity, let him remember the calamity that befell him concerning me because it is of the greatest calamities.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bayhaqi and authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we are touched by a calamity, we should not forget to say “Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allahumma aajirnee fee museebatee wakhluf lee khairan minha”(1)(Verily, to Allah we belong, and truly to Him we shall return, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it&#8221;). The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Allah will give him something better than it in exchange.&#8221;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Part of a hadith reported in Saheeh Muslim (English Translation No.1999; Chap 174)..</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should not despair regarding the Mercy of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) no matter how the calamity may befall us or how intense it may be, because Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>So verily, with the hardship, there is relief. Verily, with the hardship, there is relief (i.e. there is one hardship with two reliefs, so one hardship cannot overcome two reliefs).</em></span> &#8211; Surah ash-Sharh (94:5-6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As ‘Umar (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) stated, one hardship cannot beat two reliefs. We should not forget the favor of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) if He restores your welfare and soundness, lest we should become like those Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) mentioned in Surah az-Zumar (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا مَسَّ الْإِنسَانَ ضُرٌّ دَعَا رَبَّهُ مُنِيبًا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلَهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنْهُ نَسِيَ مَا كَانَ يَدْعُو إِلَيْهِ مِن قَبْلُ وَجَعَلَ لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا لِّيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ قُلْ تَمَتَّعْ بِكُفْرِكَ قَلِيلًا ۖ إِنَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And when some hurt touches man, he cries to his Lord (Allaah Alone), turning to Him in repentance, but when He bestows a favor upon him from Himself, he forgets that for which he cried for before, and he sets up rivals to Allaah, in order to mislead others from His Path. Say: &#8220;Take pleasure in your disbelief for a while: surely, you are (one) of the dwellers of the Fire!”</span></em> &#8211; Surah az-Zumar (39:8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should not forget that tests, calamities and trials remind us of an hour that is surely coming; a time that will end. This life is not an endless abode. Therefore, we must work for the Hereafter. At the end, the reminder and the glad tidings lie in the same verse we began with (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to the patient ones. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: </span></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221; They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.</span> &#8211; Surah al-Baqarah (2:155-157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;This statement is of the most effective and beneficial cure for the afflicted person in his sooner or later life since it comprises two great foundations such that if the slave comes to know them then he will be comforted in his affliction:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>One is that the slave and his wealth and family truly belong to Allaah, most Mighty and Majestic. Allaah made them as a loan. So if He takes them from him then it is like the lender taking his possession from the borrower (and to Allaah belongs the Best Example).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second is that the slave will return to Allaah, his true Master, and it is inevitable that he will leave this worldly life behind him and comes unto Allaah alone (without wealth, companions, or anything else) as Allaah created him the first time [see verse 6:94]. He will come only with his deeds, the good and the bad. So if this is the beginning and end of the slave, then how could he be pleased for the existence of someone or grieved for a missed one? So his contemplation of his beginning and end is from the greatest cures of this illness.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to make us from those who when afflicted with a calamity, truly remember and manifest the saying of Allaah, “<em><strong>Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon</strong></em>,” asking Him to help us with the calamities, testing, and trials, to persevere patiently, to overcome, to ask Him for reward, to anticipate the reward from Him (سبحانه و تعالى), and to compensate us with that which is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p>On the authority of Abu Abbas Abdullah bin Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify text_details">One day I was behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [riding on the same mount] and he said, <strong>“O young man, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: </strong></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah and Allah will protect you. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If you ask, then ask Allah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah [alone]. </strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allah had already prescribed against you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.”</strong></span></p>



<p class="text_details"><span style="line-height:1.5;">It was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a good and sound hadeeth.</span></p>



<p class="text_details">Another narration, other than that of Tirmidhi, reads:</p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. </strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Recognize and acknowledge Allah in times of ease and prosperity, and He will remember you in times of adversity.</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by. </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and hardship with ease.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghamm</strong> Occurs Due To Misfortunes that happened in the past while <strong>hamm</strong> occurs due to an expected misfortune in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has the feeling of grief in regard to his past sins, his grief will benefit him, because he is rewarded for it. Whoever worries about a good deed he wishes to do, his worry will benefit him as well. However if someone grieves for something that he missed from this world, then [he should know] that the missed thing will not return and that grief harms, so practically he is adding harm to harm, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A resolute person should protect himself from what brings about grief, and that is losing an object he loves. Therefore, whoever has many objects that he loves, his grief increases, and whoever decreases his objects of love his grief decreases accordingly. Someone may say, when I have no objects of love I also still have grief, we affirm this but we say to him; your grief over not having a loved one is not even a tenth of the grief experienced by the one who has lost a loved one. Have you not noticed that the one who does not have a child lives in grief but not as much as the one who lost his child?! Moreover when a person becomes accustomed to what he loves and enjoys it for a long period of time, it takes over his heart, therefore when he loses it he will feel the bitterness of his loss which will be greater than all the satisfaction he had during his lifetime. This is because the loved one is corresponding to the self just as health corresponds to it, which causes the self not to find satisfaction except in it, for its absence disturbs it. This is why the self grieves for its loss much more than it rejoices in its presence, because the inner self believes that what it had was its given right to possess. Therefore a wise person should monitor the closeness between himself, his beloved to ensure it remains moderately balanced, however if he requires that which brings about grief [i.e. loving some object or person], this causes grief then the cure is first to believe in predestination and that whatever Allah predestines is going to happen. He should then know that life is founded on distress, all constructed buildings shall eventually be ruined, all gatherings shall eventually depart, and whoever wants the lasting of what does not last is like he who wants what does not exist to exist. Therefore he should not ask of life what it was not created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It [worldly life] is founded on distress yet you want it, Free of harm and distress </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should imagine that what befell him is multiplied, for this is when what he suffers will be easier on him. It is a habit of smart porters to put something heavy on top of what they are carrying, and then after taking a few steps, to remove the heavy object as that makes what they are carrying feel lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also wait, in times of prosperity for an attack of tribulation, so that if any tribulation befalls him, he should think of what remains instead of what he has lost so that when part of that befalls him it becomes very easy on him. Such as when some- one loses some money so he counts what remains, and then considers the remaining as a profit. Or if someone imagines that he loses his eyesight, so that when he has ophthalmia, it becomes easy on him to bear this illness, likewise with the rest of harmful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prudent imagines in himself,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>his tribulations before they befall him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If they suddenly befall him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>they do not surprise him because he had already imagined them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the ignorant trusts the days,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and he forgets the demise of those who came before him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So when trials of times surprise him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with some trials he becomes lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Though if he was strict in his affairs,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>patience would have taught him boldness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the righteous predecessors said, &#8220;I saw a woman, whose youthfulness surprised me, I said, &#8216;[There is no doubt] This face has never suffered from sorrow or sadness.&#8217; She said, Do not say that! For I do not know anyone who has suffered from what I have suffered. I had a husband who bought a sacrificial animal and slaughtered it, and we had two sons. The eldest told the one younger than him, &#8216;Come and I will show you how our father slaughtered the ewe/ So he slaughtered his brother. When we started to look for him, he ran away and my husband died while looking for him/ I said, &#8216;So how are you handling your sorrow?&#8217; She said, &#8216;If I could find aid in sorrow I would have employed it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Section One: Treating Sorrow, Sadness and Grief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorrow, sadness and grief may befalls one due the prevalence of blackness, which should be treated with what will remove this blackness; which are the things that bring about joy. Grief freezes the blood while happiness heats it until its intrinsic heat is raised, both of them (happiness and grief) can harm, and may lead to death, if they are not immediately kept within moderate levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING MEN WEARING GOLD RINGS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling concerning a man wearing a gold ring, or what is known as a wedding-ring?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; answered:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible for a man to wear gold rings. neither before or after marriage. This is due to the fact that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited gold, as occurs in the authentic narrations. So once when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>saw a man wearing a gold ring, he took it from him, threw it down and said: <i>&#8220;Does a person pick up a burning piece of coal and hold it in his hand.&#8221;</i> This was related by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh</i> (6/149). So in this is a proof that it is absolutely <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) for men to wear gold rings, even if it is a wedding ring.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said: <i>&#8220;None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.&#8221;</i>3 Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>4 So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates &#8211; due to that &#8211; some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said about its people:<b> &#8220;And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment. Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you &#8211; the questioner &#8211; to be patient and expect relief from Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said in His Book:<b> &#8220;So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>5&#8243;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORCING A YOUNG LADY TO MARRY A MAN THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: Is it allowed for a father to force his daughter to marry a particular man that she does not want to marry?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; responded by saying:<br />
&#8220;Neither the father, or anyone other than the father, may force a woman who is under his guardianship to marry a man that she does not wish to marry. In fact her permission must be sought first. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A previously married women (without a husband) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin is not married until her permission is sought.&#8221;</i> They said: O Messenger of Allaah, how is her permission sought? So he said: <i>&#8220;By her being silent.&#8221;</i>7 Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Her silence is her permission.&#8221;</i>8 Yet a third narration states: <i>&#8220;A virgin&#8217;s father seeks her permission, and her permission is her remaining silent.&#8221;</i>9 So the father must seek her permission if she is nine years of age or above. Likewise, her other guardians may not marry her off except by her permission. This is obligatory upon them all. If a lady is married without her permission, then the marriage will not be correct. This is because one of the conditions of a marriage contract is that both partners accept the marriage freely. So if she is married without her permission, by threat or coercion, then the marriage is null and void&#8230; If the (apparent) husband knows that she does not want him, then he should not approach the woman, even if the father approves of it. He must fear Allaah and not approach any wife that does not want him, even if the father claims that he did not coerce her. The man must avoid what Allaah has forbidden him. This is because Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that her permission be sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise the woman to fear Allaah and to accept the man if her father finds that he suitable to marry her, as long as the prospective groom is good in his Religion and in his character. This is also the case if the one who is the guardian is not the girl&#8217;s father. We give this advice because there is a lot of good and a lot of benefit in marriage. Likewise, there are a lot of hazards in living as a maiden. So I advise all young ladies to accept those men who come to them for marriage, if they conform to the compatibility factors of marriage (i.e. good in Religion and character), they should not use studying, teaching, or anything else, as an excuse to get married.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A RELIGIOUS YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO ME BUT MY MOTHER REFUSED</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I am seeking a solution to my problem. I am twenty-four years old. A young man proposed to me. He has finished college and is from a religious family. After my father agreed to him, he asked me to come and see him. I saw him and was pleased with him. [we saw each other] because our pure and noble Religion states that I should see him and that he should see me. However, when my mother came to realise that he was from a Religious family, she became harsh against him and my father. She swore that she would not allow such a marriage to take place. My father desperately tried to persuade her, but to no avail. Do I have the right to seek the [Islaamic] Law to intervene in this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If the matter is as you have stated in your question, then your mother has no right to object, to this matter Indeed it is actually <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for her to object in this case. You are not obliged to obey your mother in this particular issue, since the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed obedience is only in ma&#8217;roof (when it is good and right).&#8221;</i>11 And it is not from <i>ma&#8217;roof</i> to reject a suitable marriage proposal. In fact, it has been narrated from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;lf there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be Fitnah (trial and discord) and great fasad (corruption) upon the earth.&#8221;12 If you have need to take your case to an [Islaamic] court of law, then you would not be wrong in doing so.&#8221;</i>13</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: <strong>Shaykh Ibn al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> – <em>rahima</em><i>hullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.” </i></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah – the Most High – due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.”</i></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates – due to that – some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allaah – the Most High said about its people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.”</span></em> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you – the questioner – to be patient and expect relief from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – just as Allaah – the Most High – said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.”</span> </em>[Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.” </i></span>[5] [6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwaa: Becoming Angry When Hardships Occur<br />
فتاوى أركان اإلسال )سOriginal Title: )46<br />
Original Author: Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison &#8211; <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from Fataawaa Arkaan Al-Islaam (no. 64) by Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Question</span></strong>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What’s the ruling of someone who becomes angry when a hardship or affliction befalls him?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Answer</span></strong>: People, during circumstances of affliction or difficulties, are at four levels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The First Level &#8211; Becoming Angry</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be in different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first way: The anger is by the heart as if he’s angry at his Lord. So, he gets angry with what Allaah has decreed for him, and this (level) is not permissible. It’s possible that it could even lead to disbelief. Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">انْقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَاآلخِرَةَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And among mankind is he who worships Allaah as it were, upon the very edge (i.e. in doubt); if good befalls him, he’s content therewith, but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts back to disbelief after embracing Islaam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter.</span> [Soorah Al-Hajj, 22:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type: The anger is by the tongue like making praying and supplicating for destruction or ruin or by similar statements, and this is also impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third type: The anger is by the limbs like slapping the cheeks, ripping the clothes, pulling out hair (some Arab cultural reactions of Jaahiliyyah), and similar actions. And none of this is allowed; it’s in contradiction to having patience which is required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The Second Level &#8211; Remaining Patient</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It’s just like a poet said, “Patience, like its name, is bitter in taste, yet its outcomes are sweeter than honey.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a person sees this thing (the affliction, problem) as weighing down heavily on him, But he bears it although he dislikes that it happened. His faith bears it patiently and prevents him from being angry. So, the times of affliction and times without are not the same to him. This (level) is obligatory because Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) commanded the people to be patient, saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاصْبِرُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And be patient. Certainly, Allaah is with the patient ones.</span>[Soorah Al-Anfaal 8:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The Third Level – Being Pleased with the Affliction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In such a way, the person is pleased with the affliction. It’s the same to him whether it happened or not; it’s not difficult upon him and he doesn’t bear it as if it is something weighing heavily on him. This (level) is preferred but not an obligation according to the most correct opinions. The difference between this level and the one before it is apparent because the affliction happening or not happening (in this third level) is the same due to the fact that the person at this level is actually content and pleased. As for the level before it, the affliction is hard upon him, yet he still remains patient over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>The Fourth Level – Being Thankful</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actually being grateful is the highest level. This is the state when a person thanks Allaah for the affliction that has befallen him. He knows that such a difficulty is a means of expiation for his sins and perhaps a cause for an increase in his good deeds. The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;">There’s no affliction that strikes a Muslim except that Allaah expiates with it (his sins), even with a thorn that may poke him</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5640) and Muslim (no. 2572)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">From Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a person commits suicide due to the circumstances of life and what he experiences of hardships of living and spending upon his family, would this mean that, that person will stay in Hell-fire?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All praise be to Allaah, <em>Sallat</em> and <em>Sallam</em> be upon the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suicide is a great evil, and it is a sin from the major sins.  It is not permissible for a Muslim to commit Suicide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. &gt;&gt; 4:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said in an authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever commits suicide using something then he will be punished using that thing on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon a believer is that he forces himself to have patience and resilience if a catastrophe befalls him and he endures difficulties in his <em>Dunyaa</em>matters.  He should not be hasty in committing suicide, rather he should be warned against that, and fear Allaah, and he should be patient and utilize the means to keep away from committing suicide, and whoever fears Allaah then Allaah will make a way out for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person commits suicide then he risks the Anger of Allaah and His punishment, and that person is under the Will of Allaah, this is because committing suicide is less than<em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Subhanahu –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. &gt;&gt; 4:48</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <strong>whatever is less than <em>Shirk</em> then it is under the Will of Allaah</strong>, and committing suicide is less then <em>Shirk</em>, likewise is <em>Zina</em> (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.  All of these things are sins that are less than <em>Shirk</em>, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.  If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after he is purified and cleared he will be taken out of the Fire, and according to the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em> <strong>he will not stay in the Hell-Fire</strong> for eternity. A sinner will not stay in the Fire for eternity, nor will a murderer, nor any other sinner, however if Allaah wants He will give him His punishment.  Allaah punishes whomsoever He wills in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of that person’s sins, then Allaah takes him out of the Fire to a river, which is called, the river of life, and he is planted there just like a seed is planted and grows on the sides of the banks of a torrential river. When that person’s growth has been completed, then Allaah enters him into Paradise due to his Islaam and his <em>Eemaan</em> upon which he dies. Only the disbeliever will stay in the Fire for eternity, only the disbelieving <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists) those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messenger, or those that belie Allaah’s Messengers, or that reject what Allaah’s Messengers brought, or other things similar to these of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the sinner, then according to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em> he will not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, and this is in contrast to the position of the Khawarij and the Mu’atazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed groups from the Khawarij and Mu’atazilah – and they are two misguided groups – say that a sinner will stay in the Hell-Fire forever, if he enters it!  And this is a grave mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em>, and they are the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible.  However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reoccurring Ahadeeth from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about this point, namely that some people will enter the Fire due to their sins then Allaah will take them out of the Fire due to the intercession of the intercessors, or with Allaah’s mercy without anyone’s intercession, and all of this is established from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>

She reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said that a seeker of refuge would seek refuge in the Sacred House and an army would be sent to him (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be made to sink. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany this army willy nilly? Thereupon he said: He would be made to sink along with them buf he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection on the basis of his intention.

A person (who had been listening to this badith from Abdullah b. Safwan) said: I bear testimony in regard to you that you are not imputing a lie to Hafsa.

An army would be sent to fight (and kill) them and when they would enter a plain ground the army would be sunk in it. Yiisuf (one of the narrators) said: It was a people of Syria (hordes of Hajjaj) who had been on that day comin. towards Mecca for an attack (on &#8216;Abdulllah b. Zubair) and Abdullah b.

And when they would reach the plain ground they would be sunk. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, all sorts of people throng the path. Thereupon he said: Yes, there would be amongst them people who would come with definite designs and those who would come under duress and there would be travellers also, but they would all be destroyed through one (stroke) of destruction. though they would be raised in different states (on the Day of Resurrection). Allah would, however, raise them according to their intention.</p>

And I have seen its eastern and western ends. And the dominion of my Unimah would reach those ends which have been drawn near me and I have been granted the red and the white trea- sure and I begged my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be destroyed because of famine, nor be dominated by an enemy who is not amongst them to take their lives and destroy them root and branch, and my Lord said: Muhammad, whenever I make a decision, there is none to change it. Well, I grant you for your Ummah that it would not be destroyed by famine and it would not be dominated by an enemy who would not be amongst it and would take their lives and destroy them root and branch even if all the people from the different parts of the world join hands together (for this purpose), but it would be from amongst them, viz. your Ummah, that some people would kill the others or imprison the others.</p>

I however, went to them and btood between them and him and I remember four of the words (on that occasion) which I repeat (on the fingers of my hand) that he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: You will attack Arabia and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you would attack Persia and He would make you to Conquer it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa and Ibn Mas&#8217;ud met together. Hudhaifa said: I know more than you as to what there would be along with the Dajjal. There would be along with him two canals (one flowing with water) and the other one (having) fire (within it), and what you would see as fire would be water and what you would see as water would be fire. So he who amongst you is able to see that and is desirous of water should drink out of that which he sees as fire.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawwas b. Sam&#8217;an reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, would one day&#8217;s prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels&#8217; hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.</p>

So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah be pleased with him).</p>

He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.</p>

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka&#8217;ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty-I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble &#8216;Urwa b Mas&#8217;ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no ran. cour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don&#8217;t you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend hfs neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much?

Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged.

When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &amp;aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about. myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? &#8216;The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he As In the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Muhadith, Allama, Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albaani<br />

<li>A Kufr less than Kufr</li>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foreword by the translator</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds, May His prayers and blessings be upon the final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the greatest blessings of Allaah Ta&#8217;aala upon this Ummah is that He has placed wisdom in the hearts of the people of knowledge. Just as one of the Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever has many Aathaar (narrations), then he speaks with wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the people of knowledge of our time was the great Muhadith, Faqih, Allaama ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albaani – May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is an amended transcript of one of the many, many sittings with the illustrious Shaykh, where he was asked about the issue of Takfeer. The sitting took place in Jordan. The transcript was amended by the Shaykh to make it suitable for print.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask our Lord Azza wa Jal to make this work a beacon of light, illuminating the path for those who have lost the way. We also ask Him to reward our noble Shaykh al-Albaani and place him in the hereafter among the ranks of the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and they are the best of companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid, and we seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evil of our selves, and the evil of our actions. Whom ever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and who ever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah Azza wa Jal, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the issue of Takfeer generally, is not only for the rulers, but it is also for the ruled. It is an old and extensive fitnah that was germinated by a sect from the Islaamic sects of old who were known as the khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is with great sadness that – some of the callers to the Deen or those who are too enthusiastic &#8211; have fallen outside the realm of the Book and the Sunnah! But in the name of the Book and the Sunnah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first reason is them being shallow in knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is &#8211; and this point is very important &#8211; that they never understood the regulations of the Sharia&#8217;. The Sharia&#8217; is the foundation of the Authentic Islaamic Dawah. All those who are outside the Authentic Islaamic Dawah are regarded as being from the deviated sects away from the Jamaa’aah which the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; praised in more than one hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this Jamaa’aah which even our Lord Azza wa Jal mentioned, and explained that whomsoever went outside this Jamaa’aah has indeed broken away from Allaah and His Messenger. That is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed Allaah Ta’ala, in a matter, that has a very clear command according to the people of knowledge – did not summarize His statement by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him . . . We shall keep him in the path&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clearest evidence here is that Allaah associated contradicting and opposing the Messenger with following a way other than the believers&#8217; path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Understanding the Book &amp; the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, following or not following the path of the Believers is a very important matter in relation to complying or denying that path. So whosoever follows the path of the Believers, then he is successful with the Lord of the worlds and whosoever differs from the path of the Believers, then Hell is sufficient for him – and what an evil destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point, numerous groups, old and new deviated because they never sufficed themselves to adhering to the path of the Believers. Instead, they rode on their own intelligence. Instead, they followed their own desires in trying to understand the Book and the Sunnah. Then they built upon their desires, their very dangerous results, and with that they left what the Salaf-As-Saalih – may Allaah be pleased with all of them- were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized this section of the noble Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;follows other than the path of the believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized it by using an eloquent emphasis, in more than just one authentic prophetic ahadeeth. These ahadeeth, which I will indicate to and mention some of, are known amongst the general Muslims, let alone the scholars of the Muslims. But what is unknown about these ahadeeth, is that they direct one towards the obligation and necessity of adhering to the path of the Believers in their understanding of the Book and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point has been forgotten – and its importance and its necessity have been forgotten by many of the specific people, not to speak of those who have become known – in these modern times &#8211; as &#8216;Jama’at Al- Takfeer &#8216;! Or by some of those kinds of groups who ascribe themselves to Jihaad, whereas in reality they are the scattered, defeated remnants of Takfeer! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst these types of people, there may be some who may very well in the depths of their hearts be righteous and sincere people. However, this alone is not sufficient for its possessor to be successful and for one to prosper with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this it is necessary for the Muslim to combine two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Having truthful sincerity in ones intention, with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Following correctly what the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not only sufficient for a Muslim to be sincere and serious in respect to acting with the Book and the Sunnah and calling towards it. But, in addition to this, his methodology should be correct, good and upright; and his methodology cannot be complete in itself except by following what the righteous Salaf of this Ummah were upon – may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these well known and established ahadeeth &#8211; that build a foundation for what I have said – as I indicated previously it is the hadeeth of the 73 sects, and it is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Jews had split up in to 71 sects and the Christians had split up into 72 sects, and my nation will split up into 73 sects all of whom will be in the fire except one. The Companions asked, ‘Which one O Messenger of Allaah?’ He replied: The Jamaa’aah.” In another narration: “What I am upon and my Companions are upon.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find the Prophet&#8217;s answer, agreeing perfectly with the previous Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Follows other than the path of the Believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who primarily enter into the generality of this Ayah are: the Companions of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, since the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was not content in this hadeeth with just saying: “What I am upon…..”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this would actually be sufficient for the Muslim who truly understands the Book and the Sunnah. But he &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – adapted practically Allaah’s saying, when Allaah characterized His Prophet that he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;For the Believers he is full of pity, kindness, and mercy&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – perfect kindness and his complete mercy for his Companions and his followers, that he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – clearly illustrated for them the distinction of the saved sect. Which implies that the are people and companions of the saved sect are upon what the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was also upon, and what his Companions were upon after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed – for the Muslims generally and the callers to Islaam specifically &#8211; to be content with just understanding the Book and Sunnah using the means of understanding which are well known. Such as knowledge of the Arabic language, the knowledge of abrogated and abrogative texts and other such rules. But it is necessary, primarily to return in all of this back to what the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -were upon, because they were – which is clear from their traditions and their biographies – the most sincere to Allaah Azza wa Jal in worship. They had more of an understanding of the Book and the Sunnah than us, and many other praise worthy characteristics with which they were shaped, and cultivated with its exquisite manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What resembles this hadeeth perfectly – in respect to its fruits and benefits &#8211; is the hadeeth of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, which is narrated in the books of as-Sunnan from the narration of al-Irbaad bin Saireeyah &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. He said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble, and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said, “It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “I advise you to hear and obey, even if an African slave rules over you, and indeed whomsoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth……………….” To the end of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof from this hadeeth is also the same evidence from the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -about the previous question (about the 73 sects). In as much as he compelled his nation to follow the characteristics of his Companions due to their adherence to his Sunnah, and he did not limit it to just that, but rather he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“……And the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for us – and this being our situation &#8211; to constantly repeat always and forever this fundamental principle. If we intend to understand our Aqeedah, understand our worship, and understand our manners and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary for us to return to our Salaf-us-Saalih to understand all these matters, which are necessary for a Muslim, so that he can actualize in himself &#8211; with sincerity – that he is from the Saved Sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point many of the sects of old and new have deviated, when they did not pay heed to the evidence in the previous Ayah, and to the significance of the hadeeth of the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, and likewise the hadeeth of the splitting of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it was completely natural that they deviated like those who deviated previously from the Book of Allaah, and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and the manhaj of the Salaf-us-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those who deviated were the Khawaarij of old and of recent times!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the foundation of the fitnah of Takfeer in this era &#8211; rather, since a long time &#8211; is surrounding the Ayah, which they themselves always keep mentioning, which is none other than His Ta&#8217;alaa saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed are the kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they take this Ayah without a deep understanding, and they present it without detailed knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that this noble Ayah has been repeated and ends with three different wordings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are oppressors&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are transgressors/sinners&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from complete ignorance that those who reason with just this Ayah with its first wording which is : &#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221; that they have not become acquainted with – at the very least &#8211; with some of the other texts of the Sharia&#8217;, whether from the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah, in which the word (al-kufr ) is mentioned. Instead they have taken it – without any understanding to mean exiting from the Deen, and that there is no difference between the one who fell into kufr, and between those mushrikeen from the Jews and the Christians and followers of the other faiths outside the faith of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas the word al-kufr in the language of the Book and the Sunnah does not – always &#8211; carry this meaning, which they constantly repeat, and attempt to impose their wrong and erroneous understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter of this word (al-kufr ) whereas it does not direct to one meaning, is also the matter of the other two words &#8220;the oppressors&#8221; and &#8220;the transgressors/sinners&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like the one who is characterized as an oppressor or sinner does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen, so the same goes for the one characterized that he is a kaafir, that it does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This diversity in the meaning of one word, that is indicated by the language, and the Sharia&#8217; came with the Arabic language; the language of the Noble Qur’aan. Due to this, it is obligatory on those who want to issue judgment on the Muslims; &#8211; regardless if it is the ruler or the ruled &#8211; that they be upon knowledge of the Book and Sunnah and in the light of the Salaf Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to understand the Book and the Sunnah – and also what is contained within it- except with the path of the Arabic language and its literature, knowing it specifically and precisely. If the student of knowledge has a deficiency in the understanding of the language, what will help him in rectifying this deficiency is returning to the understanding of the scholars before him. Especially if they are the people from the first three generations that have been certified with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Kufr less than Kufr</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we return to this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so they are the kaafiroon.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the intent of the word (al-kufr ) here? Does it take one outside of the Muslim Ummah or does it mean something else?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It is necessary to have precision in understanding this Ayah. The Ayah could mean the kufr of action and that is leaving off some of the actions from the rulings of Islaam. In addition, what helps us in this understanding is the scholar of the Ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan, Abdullah bin Abbas -may Allaah be pleased with him. He was from the Companions that all Muslims are in agreement – except those who are from the deviant sects – that he is an Imaam in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if he heard in those days, the likes of what we hear today exactly, that there are people who understand the Aayaat on its apparent meaning without its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: “It is not the kufr which you understand to mean, indeed it is not the kufr which takes you outside the fold of the Ummah, it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps he means the khawaarij &#8211; who rebelled against, the Ameer ul-Mumineen Ali &#8211; may Allaah be please with him – and as a result of that they spilled the blood of the Believers, and they did to the Believers what is not done even by the Mushrikeen. Ibn Abbas said: “The matter is not like what they have said or what they presume but indeed it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear, precise answer from the explainer of the Qur’aan. The explanation of the Ayah, from which it is not possible to have an understanding other than this (i.e. kufr less than kufr) from the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, this is what we indicated towards previously in the beginning of this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the word al-kufr, which is mentioned in many Quraanic texts and ahadeeth, is not possible to explain – regarding all these texts &#8211; that the meaning is equal to exiting outside of the Ummah. Like this is the example of the well-known hadeeth which is in the two authentic books of hadeeth (Saheeh Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) on the authority of Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ood -may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Cursing a Muslim is fassooq (sinful) and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the kufr mentioned here is sinning and it is disobedience, and the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who is regarded as the most eloquent in expression &#8211; was intense in expressing rebuke, and he said: “…….. and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From another angle we can question, is it possible for us to understand from the first section of this hadeeth – “Cursing a Muslim is fassooq…………” with the same word fisq (sin) which is mentioned in the previous Ayah with the third wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so those are the fasiqoon&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is; it could mean that the word fisq also corresponds in its meaning to the word kufr which means going out of the Ummah. It could be that the word fisq also corresponds in meaning to the word kufr which does not mean going out of the Ummah, but indeed it means just what the explainer of the Qur’aan said: It is the kufr lesser than kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth emphasizes that the kufr here could be with this meaning; because Allaah Azza wa Jaal mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if two parties among the believers fall into fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight against the one that which rebels till it complies with the command of Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed here our Lord has mentioned the rebel sect which fights the truthful believing sect, and along with this Allaah did not judge upon the rebel sect that they were kuffar, even though the hadeeth says: “. . . killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore killing him is a kufr lesser than kufr, exactly like Ibn Abbas said in the explanation of the previous Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim killing a Muslim is oppression and aggression against him, and evil and kufr, but this meaning of kufr, could be kufr of action, and perhaps could be kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From here comes the precise detailed exposition whose explanation and commentary was given by the Imaam in truth, the Shaykh of Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; and then after him his devoted student Ibn Qayeem al-Jawzeeyah who took on this responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they were blessed in making aware and explaining the division of kufr into these two divisions, whose banner was raised by the explainer of the Qur’aan with those concise and complete words. Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- and his student and companion Ibn al-Qayeem always repeatedly mentioned the necessity of distinguishing between the kufr of action and kufr of belief. Otherwise the Muslim would fall into, without knowing, the fitnah of rebelling against the community of Muslims, into which fell the khawaarij of old and some of their adherents of today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The summary of this is: indeed his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; saying, “… killing him is kufr” does not mean, &#8211; in absolute terms &#8211; going out of the Ummah. There are many hadeeth regarding this. All these hadeeeth are irrefutable evidence upon those who only hold their own deficient understanding of this previous Ayah, and cling to the explanation that this is kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For now, this hadeeth is sufficient for us, because it is a definitive proof that a Muslim killing his brother Muslim is kufr with the meaning: kufr of action and it is not the kufr of belief!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, if we return to the &#8216;Jamaat al- Takfeer &#8216; – or to those who branched off from them &#8211; and their accusation of the rulers and of those who live under their custody, and those who live under their leadership and those appointed by them, of kufr and apostasy!! Then this is built upon their evil view, which is they say: that these people have perpetrated a sin, so they have become kuffar because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Relationship between Takfeer &amp; Rebellion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the general matters which are beneficial to mention and narrate: I met some of those who used to be from Jamaaat al- Takfeer then Allaah Azza wa Jaal guided them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: here you call some of the rulers kuffar, so what do you think, for example of making the imams of masaajid kuffar, and those who give the khutbah, and those who give the adhaan in the masaajid, and those who render service to the masaajid?! What do you think about making Takfeer of the teachers of the knowledge of the Sharia&#8217; in schools, and other places, for example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: they are kuffar because they are pleased with the rule of the rulers who judge without what Allaah has revealed!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: If this &#8216;being pleased&#8217; was in agreement with the heart (i.e. belief), judging without what Allaah has revealed, then the kufr of action is altered to the kufr of belief. So, any ruler, who rules without what Allaah has revealed, and sees and believes that this ruling, is the appropriate ruling to be applied in this time! And that the ruling of the Sharia&#8217; from the text of the Book and Sunnah is not appropriate to be applied, then there is no doubt that this kufr of this ruler is the kufr of belief and is not the kufr of action alone, and whoever is pleased with this, and believes it, then he also falls into the same group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said to them: Firstly, it is not possible for you to make a judgment upon every ruler who rules with the western kufr laws or with even some of them, and that if they were questioned about judging with other than what Allaah has revealed?! They would answer; that ruling with these rules is the truth and correct in this time! And it is not allowed to rule with the rules of Islaam!! Otherwise, if they say this, they would – truly- become kuffar without doubt or suspicion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, if we came down to the people who are ruled, and from amongst them there are the scholars, amongst them are the righteous people etc. So how can you judge upon them with kufr just because you see them living under the rule, which includes them just as it includes you exactly! But you declare them to be kuffar, and apostates and that ruling with what Allaah has revealed is obligatory! Then you make an excuse for yourselves and contradict yourselves: that differing with the judgments of the Sharia&#8217; with mere actions does not deem necessarily the ruling on the one who differs with the Sharia&#8217; that he is an apostate from his Deen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly what the people other than you are saying, whether you accuse them – wrongly – with the ruling of Takfeer and apostasy!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the general discussions which show their mistakes and uncover their deviation, is saying to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When is a judgment given upon a Muslim that he has apostated from his Deen? A Muslim who testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and perhaps he prays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient just one time? Or is it obligatory to be announced that he has apostated from the Deen?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not know the answer! They will not be guided to the truth!! So we are forced to give them the following example; we say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A judge, judges with the Sharia&#8217;; this is his usual practice and this is his system, but in one judgment he misjudged, and gave a judgment against the Sharia&#8217;, i.e. he gave the right to the oppressor and prohibited it from the oppressed, so this is – most certainly &#8211; judging without what Allaah has revealed! So do you say that his kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: No, because this happened to him one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: What if the same judgment was issued from him a second time or a different judgment in which he also differed with the Sharia&#8217;, so has he committed kufr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we repeat this to them: he does this &#8216;three times!&#8217; or &#8216;Four times!&#8217; when do you say that he has committed kufr? It is not possible for them to place a limit on the number of his judgments in which he has gone against the Sharia&#8217;, by which he can be declared a kaafir!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is completely possible if it is known from him that he, in his first judgment deemed it correct to judge without what Allaah has revealed, &#8211; believing it is permissible to do so &#8211; and disapproved of judging with the Sharia&#8217;, then it would be correct to judge him with apostasy, even for this first judgment!<br />
Contrary to this, if we saw several judgments from him in a number of decisions in which he went against the Sharia&#8217;, and if we were to ask him why did you judge without what Allaah has revealed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would reply saying: I was frightened and afraid for myself! Or I was bribed for example and that is worse than the first example, but along with this, it is not possible to say he is a kaafir until he declares what is in his heart, that he does hold the view of judging without what Allaah Azza wa Jaal has revealed, and only then is it possible to say that he is a kaafir, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A summary of the speech: it is necessary to know that kufr, like fisq(sinning) and oppression is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Kufr and fisq and oppression which places one outside the Ummah, and all of these return to making it permissible by the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-The other does not place one outside of the Ummah; and all of these return to making it permissible by actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Takfeer of Sinners is not Allowed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every type of sin and specifically what is widespread in this time from what is regarded as permissible actions, such as interest, illegal sexual relations, drinking alcohol amongst them, all of these are kufr of action. So it is not allowed for us to make Takfeer of the sinners- who have been deceived by some of these sins &#8211; just because they have perpetrated a sin and regarded it as permissible actions for themselves! Except if it becomes apparent to us – with certainty – and it is unveiled with what is in the depths of their ownselves that from their Aqeedah they do not prohibit what Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited. So, if we know they have fallen into this opposition with their hearts, then we can judge that they have committed kufr, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we don’t know this, then there is no way for us to judge them with kufr, because we fear we will fall into the threat of the saying of his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; : “If a man says to his brother: ‘Oh kaffir! Indeed it returns to one of them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many ahadeeth mentioned with this meaning. I will mention a hadeeth, which is a great evidence. It is in the story of that Companion who killed one of the mushrikeen .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the mushrik saw that he was about to come under the blow of the sword of the Muslim Companion, he said, “I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah!!” The Companion took no interest in that and killed him!! When the news reached the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; he disapproved of it severely. The Companion mentioned an excuse that he did not say what he said except from the fear of being killed, but the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Did you open up his heart?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the kufr of belief does not have a fundamental connection with just actions, but it has a connection with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not possible for us to know what is in the heart of the faasiq (sinner) or the adulterer or the thief or the one who is a fornicator nor the one who takes interest, etc. Except if he confesses with his tongue what is in his heart. As far as his action is concerned then it is notification that he has opposed the Sharia&#8217;, with a differing of action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we say: without doubt you have opposed the Sharee&#8217;ah! and indeed you have committed fisq(a sin)! and adulterated! But we do not say: &#8216;Indeed you have become a kaafir and apostated from your Deen&#8217;, until there manifests from him something which will be an excuse for us with Allaah Azza wa Jaal in judging him regarding apostasy and following that comes the well know ruling in Islaam which is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -:“Whoever changes his Deen then kill him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said and I continue to say to those who constantly make Takfeer of the Muslim rulers: let’s suppose the kufr of these rulers is the kufr of apostasy! And suppose there was a ruler who was above them, then it would be obligatory – in this situation &#8211; on that higher ruler to implement the Islaamic punishment on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, how do you benefit yourselves practically if we agree for the sake of argument that all of these rulers are kuffar, and their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What can you possibly do and establish?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Takfeer is say: for the sake of &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217;, loyalty to the believers and disassociation from the kuffar!! Then we reply to them: loyalty and disassociation are connected to friendship and hate – by the heart and by actions -, and it is dependent on capability, therefore it is not conditional that you proclaim Takfeer, and declare apostacy, just because &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217; are present. Rather, friendship and hate could both take place in an innovator, sinner, or an oppressor!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I say to these people, here we have the kuffar, and they have occupied the many lands of Islaam! We are with sadness being trialed with the occupation of Palestine by the Jews. What is possible for us and for you to do about it? Is it important to stand – alone – against those rulers whom you think and claim are kuffar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If only you had left this issue alone, and started laying down the foundation for the structure, on which the foundations of an Islaamic government stands, which is following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, this is how he educated his Companions, and they built from this source its system and its foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mention this a lot, and we emphasize it a lot: that it is necessary for all Muslim organizations to work in truth, in order to bring back the rule of Islaam. Not only in the Islaamic lands, but on the whole earth, and that is the fulfillment of His Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance the Deen of Truth, to make it superior over all other religions even though the Mushrikeen hate it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been mentioned by prophecies in some of the prophetic hadeeth is that this Ayaat will be realized at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For it to be possible for the Muslims to implement this Qur’aanic text and this divine promise, it is necessary to follow an evident path and a clear way. Will this evident path be by announcing a revolution against these rulers of whom it is thought that their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?! Then along with their suspicion, which is wrong and a suspicion which is mistaken, they cannot do anything!!<br />
So what is the methodology? What is the path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt that the correct path, which is an exemplary path, is what the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; used to constantly talk about and remind his companions about in every khutbah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammed &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon all the Muslims without exception and specifically those who busy themselves with the return of Islaamic rule, that they begin from where the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – began. We have labeled this in two concise words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Purification and Education</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we know the firmly established reality, which is being neglected or more accurately purposely neglected, by those extremists who do not have anything except that they proclaim Takfeer of the rulers, and then nothing else!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they continue to proclaim Takfeer of the rulers then nothing stems from them, or about them, except discord and strife!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The calamities in these past few years which have been by the hands of these people, beginning from the discord (fitnah) of the Haraam of Makkah to the dissension in Egypt and the killing of Sadaat. Finally, in Syria and now in Egypt and Algeria- a sight that everyone can see; the shedding of the blood of many of the innocent Muslims because of these fitn, tribulations, and the occurrence of many trials and calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this because they opposed many of the texts from the Book and the Sunnah and the most important of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow, for him who hopes in the meeting with Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we really want to establish the rule of Allaah on the earth – in reality not just in a claim &#8211; then do we start with making Takfeer of the rulers while it is not possible for us to confront them – let alone fighting them &#8211; or do we start – with the obligation &#8211; the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; started with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the answer is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow……&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what did the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -begin with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known – with certainty &#8211; to anyone who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge that he began with the Daw’ah between individuals whom he thought were ready to accept the truth. Then whoever was ready to respond to him, from the individuals of the noble Companions responded to him &#8211; as it is well known in the prophetic biography. Then the punishment and the severity befell these Muslims in Makkah. After that came the command for the first migration and the second until Allaah Azza wa Jal consolidated Islaam in al-Madeena al-Munnawara. From there began the skirmishes and the opposition. Also, the fighting between the Muslims and the kuffaar on one side and the Jews from the other.……etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is necessary for us to begin by teaching the people the true Islaam; like the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had begun. Now we cannot just confine ourselves to teaching alone, because things have entered into Islaam which are not from it, and has no association with Islaam, from the bida&#8217; and innovations which were the reason for the clear downfall of the lofty status of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this it is obligatory upon those inviting to Islaam to begin with purification of Islaam from what has entered into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle – “Purification”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second principle – “Education”<br />
The education that is associated with this purification is the education of the young active Muslims on this pure Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we study the reality of the Islaamic groups which have existed, for nearly a generation, and their ideas and the practice of these ideas. We would find that many of them have not benefited themselves, nor have they benefited others with anything that can be remembered! Despite their outcry and noise, that they want an Islaamic government!! Which was a reason of spilling blood of the innocent with this baseless argument!! Without them having realised anything from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We continue to hear from their beliefs which are opposed to the Book and Sunnah and actions which are negated by the Book and Sunnah, let alone them trying, again and again with futile attempts which oppose the Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I say: there is a statement which one of the propagators of Islaam said, which I used to hope that his followers would adhere to it and fulfill it, which is: &#8216;Establish the Islaamic state in your heart it will be established for you on the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because If a Muslim corrects his Aqeedah built upon the Book and Sunnah, then there is no doubt that from this he will correct his worship, correct his behavior and his manners etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, with regret, these fine words have not been acted upon by these people, they persist with an outcry to establish the Islaamic state but without any benefit! and it is said about them – and I swear by Allaah to this &#8211; what the poet said is true:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hope for success and you do not follow its path<br />
Indeed a ship does not sail on dry land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps in this what I have mentioned is persuasive enough for every just person, and a termination for every oppressor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from <i>Al-Furqaan Magazine</i> (no.61/pp.44-46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who, in every age and intervals between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge, who call the misguided to guidance and patiently bearing ill-treatment and harm. With the Book of Allaah they give life to the dead, and by Allaah&#8217;s Light they sight to the blind. How many a person killed by <i>Iblees</i> have they revived. How many people astray and wondering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They expel from the Book of Allaah the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant-ones &#8211; those who uphold the banner of innovation and who unleash <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord), who differ about the Book oppose the Book and agree to oppose the Book. Those who speak about Allaah and His Book without knowledge, and who argue about what is ambiguous in the Book, and deceive the ignorant with such ambiguities. So we seek refuge in Allaah from the fitnahs (trials and discord) of the misguided-ones.&#8221;2 And I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner and that Muhammad <i>sallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is His trustworthy Slave and Messenger. And may Allaah extol and send His blessings of peace upon him, his family and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORBIDDANCE OF BEING HASTY AND IMPATIENT</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the very nature of <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord) is that matters become confused, mistakes increase, and minds and intellects begin to swerve. Protection and safety from this &#8211; in such times &#8211; lies in the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>; at the head of which are the scholars. So it is obligatory upon the people &#8211; those leading and those being led &#8211; to take hold of the sayings of the Scholars and to act upon them. Since the general masses being pre-occupied with issues of <i>fitnah</i>, wherein they begin to express their own opinions, only leads to an increase in the <i>fitnah</i> and further splits the Ummah. So the <i>umoorul-&#8216;aammah</i> (affairs pertaining to public benefit and welfare) &#8211; from the matters related to peace, security and fear &#8211; should be referred back to those who possess sounds knowledge and understanding, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;When there comes to them some matter related to public welfare of security or fear, they make it known amongst the people. If they had referred it back to the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or to those in authority amongst them, then the proper people would have investigated and evaluated the matter from them. Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allaah upon you, you would have indeed followed Shaytaan &#8211; except for a few of you.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:83].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;This is the disciplinary admonition from Allaah to His Servants with regards to their unbefitting action. And that it is a must for them, that when there comes to them some news concerning important issues &#8211; such as issues connected to public welfare and safety of the Believers, or those that are related to breach of security, or fear of a calamity befalling them &#8211; that they should first verify such news and not be hasty in spreading it. Rather, they should refer such issues back to the Messenger <i>sallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and to the people in authority; those who possess knowledge, understanding, sound advice, intellect, maturity and composure; those who understand the affairs and have knowledge of the associated benefits and harms. If they see that in broadcasting it there is a benefit and a cause of happiness for the Believers, and a means of protection from their enemies, then they should do so. This is why Allaah said:<b> &#8220;Then the proper people would have investigated and evaluated the matter from them.&#8221;</b> Meaning: That they would evaluate it with their sound understanding and their firm and correct knowledge. So in this is an evidence for an important principle which is: If there arises a need to investigate a particular issue, then it is obligatory that it is left to those who are qualified for it, and no one should precede them in this &#8211; and this is close to what is correct, and safer from error. And in this is also a prohibition of being hasty and impatient in spreading the news as soon as they hear it. Likewise there is a command to reflect and consider before speaking, so he looks into it to see if there is a benefit in doing so, if so he embarks upon it, and if not, he abstains from it.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE SCHOLARS AND THE AFFAIRS OF THE UMMAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the issues of <i>fitnah</i> and other detailed issues, and issues connected to matters of public welfare of the Ummah &#8211; such as affairs related to <i>siyaasatush-shar&#8217;iyyah</i> (politics of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>), and the wide-spread evils, and their like &#8211; people are in need of having sound knowledge and understanding of the <i>maslahah</i> and <i>mafsadah</i> (related benefits and harms). Since these issues, most of the time, are the cause for <i>fitnahs</i> to occur, and they are not like the issues related to purification, Prayer, Hajj and their like; which it is possible for a young student of knowledge &#8211; or in some cases, even the layman &#8211; to speak about, and to prefer one saying over another. And this is because: &#8220;Understanding the objectives and goals of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Islaamic Law) is not possible, except by thoroughly studying the texts and studying the detailed workings of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>. Since <i>fiqhul-maqaasid</i> (the science of understanding the objectives and goals of the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>) is indeed a great and mighty science which cannot be gained by just anyone. Rather, it can only be gained by one who has reached a high level of knowledge, has examined the state of affairs and is well acquainted with them, and who has looked into the various possible outcomes that may occur. And weighing between the benefits and harms is dependant upon understanding the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> and its objectives, and having understanding of the state of affairs, and the various degrees of benefits and harms. So none of this is possible, except for the Scholars.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The one ordering the good or forbidding the evil must be knowledgeable about what is being ordered or prohibited. And the level of knowledge required for this will vary in accordance with what is being ordered or prohibited. This, if it is an issue concerning clear-cut obligations and well known prohibitions &#8211; such as Prayer, Fasting, fornication or drinking intoxicants &#8211; then every Muslim is a scholar with regards to such issues. <b>However, if the issue involves detailed matters, or matters connected to <i>ijtihaad</i> (the Science of extracting rulings from the Revelation), then the general body of Muslims cannot enter into it, nor is it for them to order or prohibit. Rather, this is only for the Scholars.</b>&#8220;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the subjects that we have mentioned (i.e. that which is related to affairs of public benefit and interest of the Ummah; such as matters connected to <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> politics, weighing the affairs, correcting the widespread evil, <i>takfeer</i> (declaring Muslims to be unbelievers) and rebelling against the rulers) are from the most important subjects which have touched the Islaamic awakening in these days, and about which there is plenty of discussion, controversy and argumentation between those Muslim youths who are form in clinging to the Religion and who earnestly desire good. So these subjects are of an extremely important nature, and likewise, deviating from the correct path with regards to them is extremely dangerous!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, I wanted to gather some of the statements from our noble contemporary scholars on this subject &#8211; may Allaah protect them and look after them, and continue making them of benefit to the Ummah for the remainder of their time &#8211; those who are the Scholars of the Religion and the inheritors of the Prophets, those who concentrated on understanding the formulating principles regarding the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and the <i>haraam</i> (prohibited). Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;And whosoever from this Ummah, is known for having truthfulness, whereby he has been praised and commended by the majority of the various groups of people from this Ummah, then those are the leaders of guidance and the beacons in the darkness.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are the Rabbaanee Scholars;7 those who teach the people the Book and the wisdom, and who cultivate the people upon it. And they are the people of deep understanding and wisdom, whom Allaah commanded us to ask, by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Ask the People of Knowledge if you do not know.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So returning to them, being around them, and asking them, is the way out from the fitnahs &#8211; as we have previously explained &#8211; especially when there are a great number of differences and a great number of people differing, and many differing paths ahead of the traveller.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CLINGING TO THE JAMAA&#8217;AH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars are the leaders of the Jamaa&#8217;ah that we have been commanded to cling to; and which we have been warned against separating from &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> who related that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The blood of a Muslim who testifies that none has the right to be worshipped, except Allaah; and that I am the Messenger of Allaah, is not lawful, except in one of three cases: the one who commits adultery, a life for a life, or the one who abandons his Religion and splits from the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</i>8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Cling to the Jamaa&#8217;ah and beware of splitting! For indeed Shaytaan is with the individual person but is further away from the two people. And whosoever desires the centre of Paradise, then let him cling to the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And whosoever is pleased by his good deeds and saddened by his bad deeds, then he is a Believer.&#8221;</i>9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, whosoever clings to the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> &#8211; not separating from it &#8211; will be the successful one. But whosoever splits from the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and is amazed with his own opinion and knowledge, and the large number who follow him &#8211; then he is one who is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Bakr al-Aajurree (d.360H), after recording various Aayat (verses) and ahadeeth that order clinging to the Jamaa&#8217;ah, then said: &#8220;The sign for whosoever Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; intends goodness for, is that he traverses this path: Clinging to the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, to the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, </i>and to the path of his Companions <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i>; and all those who followed them in correctness and goodness, may Allaah have mercy upon them all; and also to what the Scholars of the Muslims were upon in the various lands &#8211; such as al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (d.157H), Sufyan ath-Thawree (d.164H), Maalik ibn Anas (d.179H), ash-Shafi&#8217;ee (d.204H), Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d.241H), al-Qaasim ibn Salaam (d.235H), and all those who were upon a path similar to theirs, avoiding taking any path which those scholars did not take.&#8221;10</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Uwais Abdullaah Ali<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> [Rahimahullah] &#8211; Transcribed Lecture</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khutubatul-Haajah …..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greater the hardship, or trial or tribulation the greater the reward. The greater the difficulty the greater the reward. The greater the trial or tribulation or difficulty that you are put through the greater the reward will be for you and for me from Allah (Tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala).<br />
If Allah loves a people, He puts them to trial, He tests them and places them in difficulty. Allah the Exalted states in Surah Baqarah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;We will test you with something of fear, and hunger and loss of wealth, and souls and vegetation. And give glad tidings to those who have patience. Those who if in any difficulty or trial, or tribulation occurs to them or happens to them, they say: &#8216;Verily We are from Allah and to Allah we return.&#8217; They are those who will receive prayers from their Lord and Mercy and it is those who are guided.&#8221;<br />
</em></strong><br />
The great reward is in accordance to how great o­nes trial, difficulty or test is. The greater the test and trial, the greater the reward. And everyone must have tests and everyone will have problems &amp; trials and everyone will be put to difficulty, everyone will have moments of grief, moments of sadness moments when things are not as they feel or would like them to be. But the difference is the believer is patient, the believer believes in the decree of Allaah, the believer seeks the reward of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer praises Allah. The believer will be rewarded in his time of difficulty. The believer has burns and the Kaafir has burns. The believer needs an operation and a Kaafir needs an operation. The believer loses a mother and a Kaafir loses a mother. The believer loses his wife and the Kaafir will lose his wife. Everyone experiences difficulty. Everyone experiences trials and tribulations but the believer because of what Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) has given him of Imaan and for what he has of patience and being pleased with the decree of Allaah, and seeking a reward from Allaah and seeing the wisdom of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) in his difficulty, he will be raised and he will receive great rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud mentions in the Sunnan, related by Ahmad :<br />
It is in the Saheehah (when you hear as-Saheehah it means it is authenticated by Shaikh Naasir ud-Din al-Albaani in his authentic books of narrations – Hadith No. 959) :The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;This my Ummah, is a Ummah that has mercy upon it, &#8216;Marhooma&#8217;- a Ummah that has mercy that&#8217;s been wrapped in Mercies; there is no punishment for this Ummah in the Hereafter except their punishment that they experience in the Dunya &#8212; killing and death and dying, trials and tribulations, earthquakes and the like.&#8221;</em> And the wording of Abu Dawud is : <em>&#8216;This Ummah reminds of the Ummah, that Allaah has placed His mercy upon. This Ummah will not have any punishment in the Hereafter, this punishment is in this world with fitn, trials, tribulations and punishments and difficulties, and earthquakes and killings, murder, death.. like this.<br />
</em><br />
&#8216;As recorded in Buhari and Muslim: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Whoever Allah wants good for him, he puts them to test. He puts them through difficulties. Like a diamond or some metal that has to be burnt and then that which is bad from it is removed so that you have that which is the pure diamond or the pure gold or whatever. Put them to tests, trials and difficulties.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As narrated by Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah : (This is the Hadith that we started with) &#8211; The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;The greater reward is with the greater trial or the greater the trial or difficulty of test or hardship is then the greater the reward. And when Allah loves a person He will tests them. So he who will be pleased and then He will be pleased. He who is displeased, then He will be displeased.'(Sahaba&#8217;s name not clear) &#8216;The people as long as they are in good health, good shape, good condition they are covered. You don&#8217;t know their true character because they are in good situation, they are in good circumstance. As long as they are in a good circumstances they are covered. But if a trial or difficulty or a hardship comes upon them, then you will see their reality. They will go to their reality. The Mu&#8217;min will run to his Imaan, the Mu&#8217;min will run to his belief, the believer will run to his belief, his Imaan and the hypocrite will run to his hypocrisy, and the hypocrite will run to his hypocrisy. &#8220;Without being shaken, you don&#8217;t not know what comes to the top and what goes to the bottom. Without being shaken you don&#8217;t know a man from those who are faking; you won&#8217;t know women from those who are faking. You won&#8217;t know those who truly believe from those who don&#8217;t. Those who make a claim o­n their tongue and is not really in their hearts and from their limbs from those who are willing to die for this matter. This can o­nly be shown by trials, the tribulations and tests and difficulties.&#8221;<br />
</em><br />
Imam Ahmed brought it and Sheikh Nassir brings in his Saheehah No. 147 : Suhaib said that, &#8216;we were sitting with the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and suddenly he laughed. Suddenly the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) laughed. He asked his companions: <em>&#8216;Won&#8217;t you ask me what I am laughing about?.&#8217;</em> So they asked the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8216;what are you laughing about ?&#8217; So he said : <em>&#8216;I laughed because I was astonished at the affair of a believer.&#8217;</em> (Listen these are words of Musthafa alaihi salam. He doesn&#8217;t speak of his own desires whatever he speaks it is revelation; Listen, these are words of Rasulullah describing a believer.). <em>All of his affairs, all of his circumstances are good, all of it. If something happens to him that he loves, if Allah blesses him with something that he loves, then he praises Allaah and this is good. And if something happens to him, if he is put into some difficulty, test or tribulation or hardship or something that he hates, he is patient and that is good for him. And no o­ne&#8217;s situation is totally good except the believer. And no o­ne else&#8217;s affair, no o­ne else&#8217;s circumstance, no o­ne else&#8217;s condition, no o­ne else&#8217;s situation is totally good except the mu&#8217;min, except the believer.&#8217;<br />
</em><br />
&#8216;The o­nes who received the most difficulty, and went through the most hardship were the beloved people to Allaah &#8212; the prophets. Allah loved them more than the rest of mankind or creatures. He tested them. He put them through test , he put them through hardship, he put them through difficulties. Listen to this narration of Ibn Majah and Sheikh Nassir also brings in his Saheehah No. 144 : (Sahaba&#8217;s name not clear) &#8220;I entered upon the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) before he passed away whilst he was suffering having a fever &#8212; I placed my hand upon him and I felt the heat from above the blanket, I felt the heat of his fever from above the blanket. I said : &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, how hard it is upon you.&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ) said : <em>&#8216;Yes, it is like that. Trials and tribulations, hardships and difficulties are doubled and multiplied and increased for us prophets. But also the reward, the blessing, the level that he is raised with Allaah upon is also multiplied and increased for him.&#8217;</em> I said : &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah who are most put through difficulty? Who are the people who are most tested? Who goes through the most trials and tribulation O&#8217; Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He said : <em>&#8216;The prophets, then the righteous (saalihun)&#8217; ,<br />
</em><br />
some of them are tested with clothing, some of them are tested with no clothing except an abaya that they place around their bodies, nothing else. But o­ne of them used to be so happy when he was put to trial or test like you see enjoyment and pleasure and contentment through ease. They were happy with trials and tribulations like you are happy with ease.&#8221;Allaah the Exalted states in Surah Al-Zumar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;Verily the patient will get their reward without it being estimated, without it being calculated. It can&#8217;t be counted. O­ne is waiting for reward, for that o­ne who is patient.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sabr, patience Akhee Msulim, my brother Muslim, upon when you are put to trial, upon when you are put to test, upon when you go through sadness, upon when you go through hardship, upon when you go through difficulties, patience – As Sabr, then it is a sign that you are upon Khair. It is the sign that you are upon good. It is a distinguishing characteristic, or it is a distinguishing matter that shows that you are upon good. It is narrated in Abu Dawud :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then it is saheeh, the happy o­ne, is the o­ne who can avoid trials and tribulations especially those that lead him astray or take him away from his deen, but the o­ne who is tested and is patient, so greater reward for him, unimaginable reward for him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also it has been related by Bukhari and Muslim : Abbas said to Ibn Rabah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Shall I show you o­ne of the women of Jannah? Saudah, this black woman who told the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) : Verily I have seizures and I become uncovered, make dua to Allaah for me.&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <em>If you are patient you will have Jannah. And if you want I&#8217;ll make dua for you that you be healthy.</em> She said : &#8216;I&#8217;ll be patient, I&#8217;ll be patient but make sure that I don&#8217;t become uncovered.&#8217; So the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) made dua to Allaah that she does not become uncovered.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how the Salaf were. Because of this some of the salafs used to say : If a difficulty happens to you, a hardship happens to you, if you are put to trial and tested and you are patient, then you have got o­nly o­ne difficulty. You have o­nly got o­ne hardship. You have o­nly got o­ne problem. Whenever a difficulty or hardship or trial comes your way and you are not patient, then you have two problems, and two hardships. And particularly if it is a loss of a child, or a loss of a loved o­ne. You are not patient with that then you have two difficulties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The loss of the o­ne you love plus the loss of the reward you would have got if you had been patient. To be patient upon the tests, and the trials, and the hardships and the difficulties as a worship for Allaah, is a worship for Allaah. Many of us know that salaah is a worship, Zakah is a worship, and ruku is a worship and sujud is a worship, and reading Quraan is a worship , how many of us know that being patient upon a hardship, upon a sadness , being patient upon a difficulty, upon a test, upon a trial is a worship for Allaah. Allaah says in Surah Al-Hajj (22:11) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;And among mankind is he who worships Allâh as it were, upon the very edge; if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, when fitnah comes to him, or a hardship befalls him, if something that brings about grief comes his way, if he is tested, if he is put to the test, when sadness comes his way, if a hardship befalls him, what happens? He flips upon his face. He loses both this world and the Hereafter. There is no doubt that this is the clear loss.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Walhamdulillah. The greater the test, the greater the reward, the greater the hardship the greater the reward, the greater the difficulty, the greater the reward from Allaah (tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala). And the Salaf understood this. Urwah Ibn Zubair, a well known from the Salaf had a problem with his foot. So the doctors decided that they had to cut it off, cut the foot off. When the doctors cut it off he didn&#8217;t say anything except these words: &#8216;O Allaah, for you are Full praise. For if you have taken some, you have left some. And if you have tested, and put through difficulty you have also put in good condition. If you have tested and tried and put through difficulty you have also put good health, good circumstances and good conditions.&#8217;The next day his son was riding a horse or mule and fell off of it and died. So they came to Urwah with the information of the death of his son, he didn&#8217;t say anything except : &#8216;O Allaah, for you is full praise. For if you have taken some, you have left some. And if you have tested and tried you have also placed us in good situations and good condition.&#8217; So when he was asked about this he said: &#8216;I had 4 limbs (meaning 2 arms and 2 legs) and Allaah took some and left some. &#8216;I had 4 limbs 2 arms and 2 legs Allaah took o­ne and left me three. I had 7 sons, Allaah (tabrak wa tala) took o­ne and left six. And he gave me good condition, or good situation my whole life up until this time. Then he tested me. Should I not praise Allaah for that? Should I not praise Allaah for that?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tests, trials, difficulties, hardships, grief, sadness, pain it raises the level of the believer. It raises the level of the believer. It is an expiation for sins. It removes sins, these difficulties and it raises o­ne&#8217;s level higher with Allaah. Raises o­ne&#8217;s level higher, places o­ne in His station or circumstance that he might not have met, he would never have reached if he had not gone through that test. It is related in Saheeh also Muhammad bin Khalid Abi An Jaddi, his grandfather was a companion that he went out visiting a brother. Then he heard that the brother was sick. So he entered upon the brother and he said : &#8216;I came to you as a visitor, and now I am also o­ne visiting the sick and also someone giving you glad tidings.&#8217; The person said: &#8216;how do you gather all this, i.e. somebody who is a visitor, somebody who is visiting a sick, somebody who is giving glad tidings? How do you gather all that?&#8217;He said : &#8216;I came out, I wanted to visit you, it reached me that you were sick, then it became that I am visiting the sick person also I give you glad tidings of something that I heard from the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) : If Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) has decreed or wants for his servant a certain Manzala, a certain position in the Jannah, a high position in the Jannah, and the servant is not going to reach it, he&#8217;s going like he&#8217;s going, he&#8217;s not going to reach it, Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) would test him, put him through hardships, would put him through difficulty regarding his body – may be he will get sick or something; or regarding his wealth – may be he will lose something; or regarding his children &#8212; may be o­ne of them will pass away or become sick or whatever. So that this person can become patient, have this Ibadah of worship, then what ? So that this person can reach the position that Allah wanted him to reach. So that he can reach the position Allaah wanted for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Same Hadith : &#8216;Who are the people who will receive the most difficulties, trials and tribulations? He said: the prophets, then those most like them, then like them, a man will be tested in accordance with his deen. A man will go through difficulties in according with his deen. A man will go through hardship in according with his deen. A man will experience sadness and grief in accordance with his deen. If his deen is strong, then his difficulties will be great. His trials will be hard. If he has in his deen some ease, or some lightness then he will be tested in accordance with the likeness of his deen. Because trials and tests want leave a servant until his sins are forgiven. That is, because the servant, he undergoes so many trials and tests, his sins are forgiven and it will be as if he is walking upon the earth without a sin. That he is walking upon the earth without a sin. In another Hadith (listen to this brother) : If you have a difficulty in your life brother, if you have a difficulty in your life sister, if there is some sadness in your household, if you lost a child, if that child has been hurt, if there is a sickness in your family or whatever the case, whatever difficulty or trial, whatever problem you are going through, listen to the words of Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), it will make it clear. Listen to the words of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), it will cool your heart, it will take you to that which is right, it will correct you, it will guide you, it will increase your faith, and your patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;There is no difficulty that happens to a Muslim except that Allaah removes a sin because of it even if a thorn pricks him and even to that degree.&#8221;<br />
</em><br />
If Allaah removes to that degree what about some other sadness? Or some other loss or some other trial or some other difficulty? Lastly Abu Huraira (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) that he heard the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and also Abu Said Al Khudri : <em>&#8216;No pain, or sickness affects a believer. No tiredness (this is also sickness), or grief nor any worry except that Allaah removes from that person a sin because of it.&#8217;<br />
</em><br />
This should tell us to be patient. This should tell us that our pathways are not going to be full with rose petals and life is not always going to give you that which you want or think you deserve, that they are going to come down your way or into your life things that are sad, things that bring you grief, things that bring difficulty but your test is shown, your character is shown, whether you can weather the storm by being patient with the decree of Allaah, in praising Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), in hoping a reward from Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), for no o­ne can reward what Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) will give the person who has patience. Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) has granted it and he will grant it without calculation. Will grant it without it being something that we could calculate or imagine. So any difficulty brother reflect upon this issue that is khair for you, is good for you, if you are a believer and if you are patient and if you praise Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and it is a way to remove your sins and a way that you have no understanding of what Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) may be preparing you for a better station, a better status in the Hereafter that you would not have reached if He had left you in that state that you were in. But when he tested you, you were patient and therefore Insha-Allaahu wa ta&#8217;ala that position or that status will be their Haada</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">O Virtuous Shaykh, with what do you advise us during this time (in) which trials (fitan) have increased and the people of innovation have become widespread and the death of the scholars? (are increasing)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you with the first thing (which is) to have<strong> taqwa of Allaah</strong> and <strong>increase in your supplication to Allaah</strong> that He keeps us and you firm upon the religion and that He protects us and you from the evils of trials (fitan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I advise you with <strong>seeking knowledge from the people of knowledge</strong> and the diligence in seeking knowledge, because one will not fall into trial (fitna) with Allaah’s permission (only) if he has the correct knowledge. But if you don’t have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don’t know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and <strong>do not become lazy</strong> upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">What is meant by this type of fitnah is the fitnah of the desires which leads to and encourages one to engage in and commit sins or disobedience to Allah.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">This type of fitnah is very dangerous especially in our times because of the fact that this type of fitnah is more appealing and closer to those who have weak souls. Thus, the (weak) individual gives in the first time, then gets drawn in to this type of fitnah and establishes a strong foothold in committing sins. Thus, his iman (faith) weakens or even leaves.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Some examples of this type of fitnah are:<strong> the desire for wealth, immoralities, amusement, food and drink, clothes, and the desire to imitate the kuffar and sinners</strong>. For example, the lust for wealth leads to falling into numerous sins like the bloodshed which emanates between warring countries or between tribes, breaking into people’s homes and businesses or their cars, embezzling people’s money by unlawful means or prohibited means like fraud or selling things which are prohibited.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;" align="left">Lust for immoralities leads to committing unlawful acts like <strong>rape, fornication or adultery, homosexuality, masturbation, luring minors or weak minded individuals into committing inappropriate acts</strong>. It also leads to <strong>watching pornographic channels, videos, on the internet or magazines</strong>. It also leads to harassing or <strong>following women</strong> in shopping malls or with video enhanced networking devices like that are included in mobile phones and computer cameras. In addition to these vices, this type of fitnah leads to lethargy with regards to performing the obligatory actions in addition to leniency with regards to them and even leads to eventually leaving them completely, not performing them at all. An individual may be chaste, have fear of Allah, be religious and then open the door to this type of fitnah and as a result become corrupt and then be destroyed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Story of a man who succumbed to Temptation</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Inspirational Read !!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that a group of people were once seated in the company of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, when some men passed by, dragging along with them a body of a dead man. When Al-Hasan saw the dead man, a glint of instant recognition could be discerned in his eyes, and he fell unconscious from the shock of some memory that had just been rekindled. When he regained consciousness, his companions asked him what was wrong with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: This man – referring to the dead man being dragged along on the ground – used to be one of the best worshipers and one of the most renowned ascetics (in the world) (renouncing all the temporary pleasures of this world because he was so busy and devoted to worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day he left his home, intending to go to the Masjid to pray, but on the way, he saw a beautiful young Christian women, who became an immediate temptation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he proposed to her, she refused, saying; “I will not marry you until you become an adherent of my religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on his way, but as time went on, he yearned for her continued to increase. He then succumbed to her wish and exited from the fold of (Islaam) the religion of pure, unadulterated Monotheism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After he became a Christian and some time passed, the woman came out to him from behind the curtain and said, “You are a man who is bereft of goodness. You have forsaken your religion, which was important to you for your entire life, simply for the sake of a lust that is of no value. Indeed, I too am forsaking my religion, but not for the same reason. I am doing so in order to achieve a blissful existence that never comes to an end, an eternal existence under the care of the One, the As-Samad (i.e., Allaah; The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creature need, He neither eats nor drinks).” She then recited the entire Chapter of Al-Ikhlaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad (saw): “He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.</span>” [Qur&#8217;aan:112:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people had heard about what she had said, they approached her and asked, “All along, you had this Chapter memorized?“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No,” she answered. “By Allaah, I had never known it before. But after this man continued to insist upon having me, I saw a dream; I saw Hellfire, and my place in it was shown to me. I became terrified and panic-stricken. Maalik – the custodian of the Hellfire – said to me: ‘Do not be afraid or sad, for Allaah has ransomed (i.e., saved) you with this man (i.e., he will take the place in Hellfire that you would have taken had not Allaah saved you).’ He then took me by the hand and admitted me into Paradise. Seeing a line written inside of it, I read it; among what was written were these Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfooz).”</span> {Qur’aan 13:39]}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited the Al-Ikhlas Chapter to me, and I began to repeat it. Then I woke up and had it (the Al-Ikhlas Chapter) memorized.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan then said, “The woman then embraced Islaam, and the man whose corpse you just saw being dragged away was killed for having apostatized. And I ask Allaah to make us firm and steadfast upon guidance and to grant us safety and success.”¹</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if Allah should touch you with adversity, there is none who can remove it except Allah; and if He intends for you good, then there is no repeller of His bounty. He causes it to reach whom He wills of His servants. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful</span></strong>&gt;&gt;<br />
[Yunus: 107]</p>
<p align="center"> <strong> by Shaykh  AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi</strong><br />
<strong> Translated by Umm Yahya<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the greatest proofs that Allaah alone is worthy of worship, for verily He is the One who grants benefit or harm, the One who provides and the One who prevents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If any harm such as poverty and sickness etc. befalls you &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> there is none who can remove it except Allaah</span> &gt;&gt;. This is because if all (those from) the creation gathered together in order to bring forth any type of benefit they would be unable to do so unless Allaah wrote it for them (thus allowing it). Likewise if (those from) the creation of Allaah gathered in order to cause harm to anyone, they would be unable to do so unless Allaah allowed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> This is why Allaah says: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">and if He intends for you good, then there is no repeller of His bounty.</span> &gt;&gt; meaning, that it is not possible for any of Allaah’s creation to reject His Good and His Kindness, as Allaah says: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Whatever Allah grants people of His mercy &#8211; none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds &#8211; none can release it thereafter</span>&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">He causes it to reach whom He wills of His servants.</span> &gt;&gt; meaning Allaah selects whomsoever He wills with His Mercy from His creation, verily Allah possesses all Excellence and Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">He is the Most Forgiving</span>&gt;&gt; of all the mistakes of the creation, He grants His slave success through the means of His forgiveness, consequently if a slave sins Allah forgives his sins regardless of whether they are major sins or minor sins. He is Ar-Raheem (the Merciful), thus His Mercy encompasses all that exists, hence it is not possible to exist without His goodness even for the (time of) a blink of an eye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore a slave of Allaah becomes aware of the clear evidence that illustrates that Allaah exclusively is the One who bestows blessings in addition to clearing afflictions and granting good and removing evils and hardships.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is none from the creation who possesses an iota of this ability to unless it is by Allaah’s permission. Therefore this knowledge obligates upon us an awareness of the reality that Allaah Alone is the Truth and what others call to other than him is merely falsehood.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: </strong>What is the ruling on one who becomes discontented when he is afflicted by calamity?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: </strong>In times of calamity, people divide into four different levels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Level:</strong> Discontent and there are different types of discontent:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1.</strong> In the heart, as if he is angry with his Lord, and so he rails against what Allāh has ordained for him, and this is forbidden and could even lead to disbelief. Allāh, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةَ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge (i.e. in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts to disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter.” </span>(Al-Hajj 22:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2.</strong> That it is spoken, such as invoking woe, destruction and the like and this is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3.</strong> That it is physical, such as striking the cheeks, tearing the clothes and pulling out the hair and the like, and all of this is forbidden, because it negates the patience which is required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level:</strong> Patience and this is as the poet says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Patience is like its name, its taste is bitter,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>But the end result s of it are sweeter than honey.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he considers this burden heavy, yet he bears it, even though he hates that it should occur, and his faith protects him from discontent. So, its occurring or not occurring are not the same to him. This is an obligation, because Allāh, the Most High has commanded him to be patient, saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“and be patient. Surely, Allah is with those who are As-Sabirun (the patient).”</span> (Al-Anfal 8:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level: </strong>Acceptance: That a person accepts misfortune, so that its presence or absence are the same to him. Its presence is not hard on him, and he does not bear a heavy burden due to it, and this is highly preferred, although not obligatory, according to the most authoritative opinion. The difference between it and the last level is clear, because the presence of misfortune and its absence are the same in the acceptance of this person, whereas in the level before it, misfortune is difficult for him, yet he bears it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Level:</strong> Gratitude, and this is the highest level: It is by him thanking Allah for the misfortune which has befallen him, because he knows that this misfortune is a cause of his sins being remitted and  and it might also be a cause of his reward being increased. The Prophet <em>salAllahu alayhi wasallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“There is no misfortune that afflicts a Muslim except that Allah remits a sin from him because of it, even the prick he receives from a thorn.”</em></strong> (Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed from: </strong><em>Fatawa Arkan-ul-Islam | </em>Islamic Verdicts on the Pillars of Islam, Volume 1 – Creed and Prayer | Shaykh ‘Uthaymeen | Darussalam English Publications</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Wuhayb b. Al-Ward – Allâh have mercy on him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, when Allâh the Exalted wants to honor a servant of His (for his righteousness), He afflicts him with a reduced means of living, illness in his body and a fearful life (all of which expiate his sins). Until death comes upon him, and he still has some sins, death is made hard upon him because of them, causing him to meet Allâh with no sins against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when a person is of little value to Allâh (because of his disobedience), He makes his body healthy, broadens his means of living and makes him feel safe (the rewards for any good deeds he did are exhausted). Until death comes upon him, and he still has some good deeds, the experience of death is lightened for him because of them, and he meets Allâh with nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr Al-Daynûrî, <em>Al-Mujâlasah wa Jawâhir Al-’Ilm</em> article 2865.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Surah No.41 :(Fussilat)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(49. Man does not get tired of asking for good; but if an evil touches him, then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.) (50. And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him. &#8220;Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.) (51. And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant; but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that man never gets bored of asking his Lord for good things, such as wealth, physical health, etc., but if evil touches him &#8212; i.e., trials and difficulties or poverty &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.), i.e., he thinks that he will never experience anything good again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is due to my (merit)&#8230;&#8221;) means, if something good happens to him or some provision comes to him after a period of difficulty, he says, `this is because of me, because I deserve this from my Lord.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I think not that the Hour will be established.) means, he does not believe that the Hour will come. So when he is given some blessing, he becomes careless, arrogant and ungrateful, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Verily, man does transgress. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.) (96:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him.) means, `if there is a Hereafter after all, then my Lord will be generous and kind to me just as He was in this world.&#8217; So he expects Allah to do him favors in spite of his bad deeds and lack of certain faith. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.) Thus Allah threatens punishment and vengeance to those whose conduct and belief is like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant;) means, he turns away from doing acts of obedience and is too proud to obey the commands of Allah. This is like the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But ﴿Fir`awn﴾ turned away along with his hosts) (51:39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but when evil touches him,) means, difficulties,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then he has recourse to long supplications.) means, he asks at length for one thing. Long supplications are those which are long on words and short on meaning. The opposite is concise speech which is brief but full of meaning. And Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) (10:12)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997 &#8211; <a title="# Questions Concerning Everyday Issues : Shaykh bin Bâz" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/daily-issues-2/">Everyday Issues</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[Q]</strong>: There was a person in our city who was very firm in practicing the Religion, and was later afflicted with an illness. Some of the people started saying to him that the cause of him being afflicted with this illness is because of his adhering to the Religion. Being affected with this type of talk, the person then shaved off his beard and he neglected his Prayers. So is it permissible to say that the cause of his affliction was due to him clinging to the commandments of the Religion? And the one who says such a thing, is he considered a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because of such a saying?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[A]</strong>: &#8221;Clinging on to the Religion is not a cause for his illness. Rather, it is a cause for every good, both in this life and in the Hereafter. And it is not permissible for any Muslim, that when some foolish and ignorant people utter words such as this, to give them any weight. Nor is it permissible to shave one&#8217;s beard or shorten it, or to neglect guarding the five obligatory Prayers in congregation. Rather, it is obligatory for such a person to remain steadfast upon the truth, and to keep away from all that Allaah has prohibited, and to beware of all that which angers Allaah and incurs His punishment &#8211; by obeying Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That will be the greatest achievement. But whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, Allaah will cast him in the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a humiliating punishment.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:13-14]. And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa (piety, fear and obedience) of Allaah, He will make a way out for him. And He will provide for him from places he could never imagine.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa of Allaah, He will make his affair easy for him,&#8221; </strong>[Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who says that the cause for such affliction is due to being firm and steadfast upon the Religion &#8211; then such a person is ignorant. It is obligatory to censure such a person and to know that <strong>clinging to the Religion does not bring about anything except good</strong>. As for what occurs to a Muslim by way of a calamity that he dislikes, then this is a form of expiating his evil actions and a forgiveness for his sins. As regards to the issue of <em>takfeer</em> (declaring a Muslim to be a <em>kaafir</em>, a disbeliever) upon this person, then this requires detail, and is known from the chapters concerning the judgement upon a <em>murtad</em> (apostate) &#8211; which can be found in the books of Islaamic jurisprudence and understanding. And with Allaah is the power and ability.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <em>Al-Fataawaa</em> (1/32-33).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer &#8211; Suratul Baqarah [Surah No.2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(155. And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (157. They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us that He tests and tries His servants, just as He said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and As-Sabirin (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).)</strong> (47:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, He tests them with the bounty sometimes and sometimes with the afflictions of fear and hunger. Allah said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear.) (16:112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frightened and the hungry persons show the effects of the affliction outwardly and this is why Allah has used here the word `Libas&#8217; (cover or clothes) of fear and hunger. In the Ayat above, Allah used the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(with something of fear, hunger,) meaning, a little of each. Then (Allah said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(loss of wealth,) meaning, some of the wealth will be destroyed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lives) meaning, losing friends, relatives and loved ones to death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and fruits,) meaning, the gardens and the farms will not produce the usual or expected amounts. This is why Allah said next:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then explained whom He meant by `the patient&#8217; whom He praised:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</strong> meaning, those who recite this statement to comfort themselves in the face of their loss, know that they belong to Allah and that He does what He wills with His servants. They also know that nothing and no deed, even if it was the weight of an atom, will be lost with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. These facts thus compel them to admit that they are Allah&#8217;s servants and that their return will be to Him in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are those on whom are the Salawat (i. e., who are blessed and will be forgiven)</strong> from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy,) meaning, Allah&#8217;s praise and mercy will be with them. Sa`id bin Jubayr added, &#8220;Meaning, safety from the torment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and it is they who are the guided ones.)</strong> `Umar bin Al-Khattab commented: &#8220;What righteous things, and what a great heights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They are those on whom are the Salawat from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy) are the two righteous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and it is they who are the guided ones) are the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heights means more rewards, and these people will be awarded their rewards and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several Ahadith that mention the <strong>rewards of admitting</strong> that the return is to Allah by saying:(&#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;) when afflictions strike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, Imam Ahmad reported that Umm Salamah narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, Abu Salamah came back after he was with Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger recite a statement that made me delighted. He said:(No Muslim is struck with an affliction and then says Istirja` when the affliction strikes, and then says: `O Allah! Reward me for my loss and give me what is better than it,&#8217; but Allah will do just that.) Umm Salamah said: So I memorized these words. When Abu Salamah died I said Istirja` and said: &#8220;O Allah! Compensate me for my loss and give me what is better than it.&#8221; I then thought about it and said, &#8220;Who is better than Abu Salamah&#8221; When my `Iddah (the period of time before the widow or divorced woman can remarry) finished, Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked for permission to see me while I was dyeing a skin that I had. I washed my hands, gave him permission to enter and handed him a pillow, and he sat on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked me for marriage and when he finished his speech, I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! It is not because I do not want you, but I am very jealous and I fear that you might experience some wrong mannerism from me for which Allah would punish me. I am old and have children.&#8221; He said: (As for the jealousy that you mentioned, Allah the Exalted will remove it from you. As for your being old as you mentioned, I have suffered what you have suffered. And for your having children, they are my children too.) She said, &#8220;I have surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her and Umm Salamah said later, &#8220;Allah compensated me with who is better than Abu Salamah: Allah&#8217;s Messenger .&#8217; [ Muslim reported a shorter version of this Hadith]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From the Fatawaa of our Shaykh, Allaama Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz. Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya [Taken from : binbaz.org.sa via Sahab.net]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If a person is put to trial with a sickness or an evil affliction physically or with his wealth, how does he know that this trial is a test or Anger from Allaah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Azza Wa Jal</em> tests His slaves in prosperity and adversity, in hardship and ease. He sometimes tests them with these things to raise their grade and to enhance the status of those people and to double their good deeds. Like what Allaah did for the Prophets and Messengers &#8211; <em>alayhim as-Salaat wa as-Salaam</em>, as well as the righteous people from the worshippers of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said: the most severely of the people to be trialed are the Prophets, then those who are next in grade, then the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes Allaah does this due to the sins and transgression of the people, so that the punishment can be hurried.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what is general for humans is that they are deficient, and they do not observe all the obligatory duties. Therefore, what afflicts them is due to their sins and shortcomings with regard to Allaah&#8217;s commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, if someone from the righteous slaves of Allaah is afflicted with some disease or something similar, then this is from the type of trials for the Prophets and Messengers, raising of their grades and increase of reward, to be an example for others, in having patience and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So briefly, it could be a test to raise grades and to make the reward greater, like Allaah does for some of the righteous people. It could be expiation for evil deeds, as is mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta&#8217;ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the saying of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> –: A Muslim is not afflicted with distress, nor sorrow, nor disease nor hardship, nor sadness nor any harm except that Allaah expiates from his sins even by a thorn that pricks him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – whom so ever Allaah intends good for, Allaah compels him with a trial. It could be that this is a punishment which has been hastened due to transgression by the slave and him not having hastened in repenting as is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Messenger &#8211; <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8216;If Allaah intends good for His slave then He hastens his punishment in this world, and if Allaah prescribes evil for His slave, then Allaah holds back his sins until He recompenses them for him on the Day of Judgment.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ Narrated by Tirmidhi &amp; he declared it hasan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says in Surah Al-Hajj (22:11) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;And among mankind is he who worships Allâh as it were, upon the very edge; if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, when fitnah comes to him, or a hardship befalls him, if something that brings about grief comes his way, if he is tested, if he is put to the test, when sadness comes his way, if a hardship befalls him, what happens? He flips upon his face. He loses both this world and the Hereafter. There is no doubt that this is the clear loss.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Walhamdulillah. The greater the test, the greater the reward, the greater the hardship the greater the reward, the greater the difficulty, the greater the reward from Allaah (tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala). And the Salaf understood this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Urwah Ibn Zubair, a well known from the Salaf had a problem with his foot. So the doctors decided that they had to cut it off, cut the foot off. When the doctors cut it off he didn&#8217;t say anything except these words: &#8216;<span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah, for you are Full praise. For if you have taken some, you have left some. And if you have tested, and put through difficulty you have also put in good condition. If you have tested and tried and put through difficulty you have also put good health, good circumstances and good conditions</span>.&#8217;The next day his son was riding a horse or mule and fell off of it and died. So they came to Urwah with the information of the death of his son, he didn&#8217;t say anything except : &#8216;<span style="color:#008080;">O Allaah, for you is full praise. For if you have taken some, you have left some. And if you have tested and tried you have also placed us in good situations and good condition</span>.&#8217; So when he was asked about this he said: &#8216;I had 4 limbs (meaning 2 arms and 2 legs) and Allaah took some and left some. &#8216;I had 4 limbs 2 arms and 2 legs Allaah took o­ne and left me three. I had 7 sons, Allaah (tabrak wa tala) took o­ne and left six. And he gave me good condition, or good situation my whole life up until this time. Then he tested me. Should I not praise Allaah for that? Should I not praise Allaah for that?&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Another <strong>excellent piece of analysis</strong> &amp; advice from Imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Source: Provisions for the Hereafter (Mukhtasar Zad Al-Ma’ad) &#8211; By: Imâm Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah. Summarized by: Imam Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab At-Tamimi Pgs.457-459.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And certainly we shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirun (the patient). Who, when afflicted with calamity, say, “Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi raji’un (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return).” They are those o­n whom are the Salawat ( i.e who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and ( they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided o­nes.&#8221;</span> Surah Al-Baqarah 2:155-157</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (i.e. Ibn Al- Qayyim) mentioned the <strong>Hadeeth of Al-Istirja</strong> and then he said: <strong>This expression is o­ne of the most effective and most beneficial treatments for o­ne who is afflicted by calamities</strong>, because it contains two fundamental principles, which if they are realized, the slave will be consoled thereby from his calamity.(Al- Istirja’: saying the words: “<em>Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi raji’un</em>”) Verily, we are for Allah and to Him we shall return. This Hadeeth was narrated by Muslim and Ahmad, o­n the authority of Umm Salamah radi Allahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them is that the slave and his wealth belong to Allah and He has given it to him as a loan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second of them is that the return is to Allah and it is inevitable that he will leave the life of this world behind; so if this is his beginning and his end, then his thinking about them is o­ne of the greatest treatments for this illness and a part of his treatment is that he knows that what was ordained to afflict him cannot miss him and what was ordained to miss him cannot afflict him.And a part of it is that his Lord has set aside for him the like of that which he missed or better and He has stored up for him that which is many times better than the calamity and that if He had willed, He could have made the calamity greater than it was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of his extinguishing the fire of his misfortune by the coolness of comfort and consolation, so he should look to his right and to his left (i.e. at the world around him) and he should know that the pleasures of this life are an illusion, though they may cause him to laugh a little, they will cause him to weep much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also a part of it is the knowledge that discontent does not alleviate the misfortune; indeed , it increases it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another part of it is the knowledge that losing the reward which Allah has guaranteed for patience and Istirja’ is greater than it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another part of the treatment is the knowledge that discontent causes his enemy to take pleasure and grieves his friend and makes his Lord Angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Still another part of it is the knowledge that the pleasure which follows patient perseverance and the expectation of Allah’s Reward is many times greater than that which he would have experienced from the thing which he lost, if it had remained with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is that he should sooth his heart by seeking recompense for it from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a part of it is the knowledge that his reaction to the calamity will determine what happens to him, for whoever accepts( Allah’s Qadr), Allah will be pleased with him and whoever is angry at it, Allah will be angry with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also a part of the treatment is the knowledge that even if he was patient sometime after the calamity struck, that being the patience of the o­ne who is resigned, that is not praiseworthy and it is not rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is the knowledge that o­ne of the most effective medicines is the success granted by Allah in attaining that which He loves and which is pleasing to Him and that it is the essence of love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is for him to compare between the greater and the lesser of the two pleasures: between the pleasure which he enjoys due to (his acceptance of) the calamity which befell him and the pleasure which he enjoys due to the reward of Allah (which he receives due to his acceptance and patient perseverance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a part of it is the knowledge that the o­ne who put him to trial is the Best of judges and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy and that He has not subjected him to misfortune in order to destroy him, but in order to test him and to hear entreaties and see him prostrating at His door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another part of it is the knowledge that misfortunes are a means of preventing sickness which will cause his destruction, such as pride, arrogance, and hardness of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Still another part of it is the knowledge that the bitterness of this life is the sweetness of the afterlife and vice versa. And if this is not apparent to you, examine the words of the truthful o­ne, whose words are believed<em>:“Paradise is surrounded by hardships and the Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.”</em>(Narrated Muslim, At-Tirmidihi, Ahmad and Ad-Darimi, o­n the authority of Anas Ibn Malik radi Allahu anha).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in this matter, the minds of mankind are at fault and the reality of men is made clear (i.e. that they prefer the temporary pleasures of this world to the everlasting pleasures of the Hereafter).</p>
