<p style="text-align:center;">‘Silsilah al-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah’.<br />
By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani. Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3258</strong> – On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said : this is on my side of the land! And I said : It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be a requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said : ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> to order you to say it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em>about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , and the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said : ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> went off to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabeeyah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Benefits Derived from the Story of Yusuf</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Chapter 1: The Dream of the Two Young Men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the dream of the two young men, where one of them said:</p>
<p><strong>وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ السِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ ۖ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَا إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا ۖ وَقَالَ الْآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزًا تَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘Verily, I saw myself </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a dream)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> pressing wine.’ The other said: ‘Verily, I saw myself </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a dream)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof.’ </span></strong> [Yusuf: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were kind to Yusuf so that he would inform them of the interpretation of their dream. This is due to what they witnessed of his being good to things and to the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf –alayhi sallam- interpreted the dream of the one who saw that he was pressing wine to be that he would be saved from the prison and would return to his status of serving his master, so he would press grapes for his master, resulting in wine. He interpreted the other dream to be that person being killed, then crucified and birds eating from his head. As for the first dream then it came in a literal form. As for the other dream, then it came in the form of a similitude; that he would be killed, and even though he would have been killed, he would still be crucified and would not be buried until birds had eaten from his head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an amazing insight, which gives precise meanings, as it is the custom that a person who is killed is buried straight away, such that it would not be possible for beasts and birds to eat from him. However, Yusuf –alayhi sallam- understood that this person would be killed and not buried quickly so that he reached this state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the humiliation of that man, and his despicable, evil worldly destiny which causes the skin to tremble. He knew that this dream was real and would definitely take place. Yusuf said to them:</p>
<p><strong>قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ الَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ<br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.’</strong></span> [Yusuf: 41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from his complete knowledge of interpreting dreams, which are not interpreted based on suspicion and delusion, rather they are interpreted upon knowledge and certainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the appropriateness of the interpretation of this dream, it is that birds do not come close to living things, rather they eat from the deceased if there is no one close to the dead body, and this takes place after the person has been killed and crucified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the perfection of Yusuf, his advice and his amazing intelligence is that he was careful in interpreting their dreams when they narrated them to him and he promised them that he would interpret the dreams at the earliest time. Yusuf said:</p>
<p><strong>لَا يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلَّا نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No food will come to you </strong>(in wakefulness or in a dream) <strong>as your provision, but I will inform </strong>(in wakefulness)<strong> its interpretation before it </strong>(the food) <strong>comes</strong></span>. [Yusuf: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He promised them the interpretations before the first meal was to be brought for them from outside the prison so that they would be calm and eager to hear the interpretations. Yusuf did this so he would be able to give them Da’wah before he gave them the interpretations so that they would be more receptive to accepting the Da’wah to Allaah because calling them to Allaah was more important than interpreting their dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called them to Allaah using two means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Firstly:</strong></span> through his own self, in how he was and in his beautiful description that made him reach this noble station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf –alayhim as-Salaam- said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِي رَبِّي ۚ إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ مَا كَانَ لَنَا أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِاللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This is of that which my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have abandoned the religion of a people that do not believe in Allaah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter</strong> (i.e. the Kan&#8217;âniun of Egypt who were polytheists and used to worship the sun and other false deities)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘And I have followed the religion of my fathers, &#8211; Ibraheem, Ishaaq and Ya’qoob, and never could we attribute any partners whatsoever to Allaah. This is from the Grace of Allaah to us and to mankind, but most men are not thankful.</strong></span>[Yusuf: 37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second matter:</strong></span> He called them through natural, real evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said :</p>
<p><strong>يَا صَاحِبَيِ السِّجْنِ أَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p><strong>مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ ۚ أَمَرَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘O two companions of the prison! Are many different lords </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(gods)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> better or Allaah, the One, the Irresistible? ‘You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(forged),</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(or the judgement)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(true)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> straight religion, but most men do not know.</span></strong>  [Yusuf: 39-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed The One who is singled out with perfection from all angles, and with complete control over all the world, the upper and the lower, The One Who is deserving of complete worship, Who created the creation for His worship and He ordered them to do it, He has the command over His slaves in this world and the Hereafter. He is the One Whom it is necessary to worship Alone, other than Whom there are things that are worshipped which are deficient and of different types &#8211; those things which many people claim divinity for, but they do not have anything of the real meaning of divinity nor are they deserving of worship, rather they are titles which they have defined and names without any meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Yusuf saw that calling them to Allaah was foremost rather than the interpretation of their dreams and it was more beneficial for them and other than them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith, but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(still) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">pants. Such is the parable of the people who reject Our Ayat. So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect.Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat, and used to wrong themselves.</span></strong> (Qur&#8217;an Al-A&#8217;raf 07, Verses 175-177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that Allah&#8217;s statement,<strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away</strong>) <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Is about Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217; a man from the Children of Israel.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah and several other narrators narrated this statement from Mansur who got it from Ibn Mas`ud. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah narrated that Qatadah said that Ibn `Abbas said,<span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;He is Sayfi, son of Ar-Rahib.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah commented that Ka`b said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was a man from Al-Balqla&#8217; (a province of Jordan) who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name. He used to live in Bayt Al-Maqdis with the tyrants.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am bin Ba`ura&#8217;, a man from Yemen whom Allah had given the knowledge of His Ayat, but he abandoned them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Dinar said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He was one of the scholars of the Children of Israel whose supplication was acceptable. They used to seek his lead in suplication in times of difficulty. Allah&#8217;s Prophet Musa sent him to the King of Madyan to call him to Allah. That king appeased him and gave him land and gifts, and he reverted from the religion of Musa and followed the king&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Imran bin `Uyaynah narrated that `Husayn said that `Imran bin Al-Harith said that Ibn `Abbas said, <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He is Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;.&#8221;</span> Similar was said by Mujahid and `Ikrimah. Therefore, it is well-known that this honorable Ayah was revealed about a man from the Children of Israel in ancient times, according to Ibn Mas`ud and several others among the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;He is a man from the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem) whose name was Bal`am and who knew Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah also reported that Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;When Musa and those with him went to the city of the tyrants (Jerusalem), the cousins of Bal`am and his people came to him and said, `Musa is a strong man, and he has many soldiers. If he gains the upper hand over us, we will be destroyed. Therefore, supplicate to Allah that He prevents Musa and those with him from prevailing over us.&#8217; Bal`am said, `If I supplicate to Allah that He turns back Musa and those with him, I will lose in this life and the Hereafter.&#8217; They kept luring him until he supplicated against Musa and his people, and Allah took away what he bestowed on him (of knowledge). Hence Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he threw them away; so Shaytan followed him up).&#8221;</strong>&#8216; Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires.)</strong> Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith)</strong> from the filth of this earthly life through the Ayat that We gave him knowledge of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but he clung to the earth)</strong>, he became interested in the adornment of this life and its delights. He indulged in the lusts of life and its joys and was deceived by it, just as life deceived others like him, without sound comprehension or a good mind. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar narrated from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr that when Musa entered the land of Bani Canaan in the area of Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), the people of Bal`am came to him, saying, &#8220;This is Musa, son of `Imran with the Children of Israel. He wants to drive us out from our land, kill us and replace us with the Children of Israel. We are your people and have no other dwelling area. You are a person whose supplication is acceptable (to Allah), so go out and supplicate to Allah against them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Woe to you! Here is Allah&#8217;s Prophet (Musa) with whom the angels and believers are! How can I supplicate against them when I know from Allah what I know&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have no other dwelling area.&#8221; So they kept luring and begging him until he was tempted by the trial and went on his donkey towards Mount Husban, which was behind the Israelite military barracks. When he proceeded on the Mount for a while, the donkey sat down and refused to proceed. He got off the donkey and struck it until it stood up again and he rode it. The donkey did the same after a little while, and he struck it again until it stood up&#8230; So he proceeded and tried to supplicate against Musa and his people. However, Allah made his tongue mention his people with evil and the Children of Israel with good instead of his people, who protested, &#8220;O Bal`am! What are you doing You are supplicating for them and against us!&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is against my will. This is a matter that Allah has decided.&#8221; He then said to them, as his tongue was made to loll out of his mouth, &#8220;Now I have lost this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; This Ayah was revealed about the story of Bal`am son of Ba`ura&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat, but he threw them away.)</strong>, until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he pants, or if you leave him alone, he (still) pants.)</strong> Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions regarding the meaning of this Ayah. Some scholars said that it refers to the end of Bal`am&#8217;s tongue which flickered out of his mouth, as in the story narrated from Ibn Ishaq, from Salim, from Abu An-Nadr. Therefore, his example is the example of the dog, its tongue pants regardless of whether it is driven away or not. It was also said that the meaning here is a parable of this man &#8212; and his like &#8212; concerning their misguidance, persisting the wrong path and not being able to benefit from faith or comprehend what they are being called to. So his example is that of a dog which pants whether it was driven away or left alone. The person described here does not benefit from the advice or the call to faith, just as if the advice and call never occurred. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(It is the same to them (disbelievers) whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.)</strong></span>(2:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whether you ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them &#8212; (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness &#8212; Allah will not forgive them.)</span> </strong>(9:80) and similar Ayat. It was also said that the meaning here, is that the heart of the disbeliever, the hypocrite and the wicked is weak and devoid of guidance. Therefore, it keeps faltering. Similar was narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect)</strong> Allah said next to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So relate the stories, perhaps they may)</strong> the Children of Israel, who have knowledge ot the story of Bal`am and what happened to him when Allah allowed him to stray and expelled him from His mercy. Allah favored him by teaching him His Greatest Name, by which, if He is asked, He will grant, and if He is called upon, He answers. But Bal`am used it in disobedience to Allah and invoked Him against His own party of the people of faith, followers of His servant and Messenger during that time, Musa, the son of `Imran, peace be upon him, whom Allah spoke to directly,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(perhaps they may reflect.)</strong> and avoid Bal`am&#8217;s behavior, for Allah has given the Jews knowledge and made them superior to the bedouins surrounding them. He gave them the description of Muhammad ﷺ which would allow them to recognize him, as they recognize their own children. They, among people, have the most right to follow, aid and support Muhammad ﷺ , in obedience to their Prophets who informed them of him and commanded them to follow him. Therefore, whoever among them defies the knowledge in their Books or hides it from the servants, Allah will place disgrace on him in this life, followed by humiliation in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayat.)</strong> Allah says, evil is the example of the people who deny Our Ayat in that they are equated with dogs that have no interest but to collect food and satisfy lusts.&#8217; Therefore, whoever goes out of the area of knowledge and guidance, and seeks satisfaction for his lusts and vain desires, is just like a dog; what an evil example. The Sahih recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The evil example is not suitable for us: he who goes back on his gift is just like the dog that eats its vomit.)</strong> Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and they used to wrong themselves.)</strong> means, Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves by rejecting guidance, not obeying the Lord, being content with this life that will soon end, all the while seeking to fulfill desires and obey lusts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(178. Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the guided one, and whomsoever He sends astray, &#8212; then those! They are the losers.) </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, whomever He leads aright, then none can lead him to misguidance, and whomever He leads astray, will have acquired failure, loss and sure misguidance. Verily, whatever Allah wills occurs; and whatever He does not will, does not occur. A Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reads,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(All praise is due to Allah, Whom we praise and seek help, guidance and forgiveness from. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils within ourselves and from the burden of our evil deeds. He whom Allah guides, will never be misled; and he whom He misguides, will never have one who will guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah without partners and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete Hadith was collected by Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#8220;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#8221; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#8221; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2.259)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord)</span> means, &#8220;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord&#8221; Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs)</span> to the Ayah above by using `or&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah (2:259) meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(in ruin)</span> means, it became empty of people. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(up to its roofs)</span> indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death)</span> because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body.</strong></span> When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;Or part of a day. &#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(And look at your donkey!),</span> &#8220;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people)</span> that Resurrection occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha)</span> meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(how We Nunshizuha.)</span> Al-Hakim said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#8221; The Ayah was also read,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nunshiruha&#8221; meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And clothe them with flesh. )</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8221; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys&#8217; nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching</strong></span>, and this is when he proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(He said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,&#8221;)</span> meaning, &#8220;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh. I saw that he was strong in Salafi Tawheed, so I sat there until the Adhan of Isha. Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘<strong>O Shaykh how did you learn Tawheed?</strong>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: your question is excellent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: Salafiyoon are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a Salafi, so how did Salafeeyah come to you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it. He began explaining the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf to me. He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus whoever spends something today will benefit from it tomorrow and whoever does not spend will come to find nothing, and he will have a great loss in the house of dwelling (in the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O son of Adam, you will only live on the Day of Judgment in what you have built, and you will find on that day what possessions you have prepared in your life</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A women entered upon &#8216;A&#8217;ishah (radiy Allaahu anha), and her hand was paralysed. She said, “O mother of the Believers, I went to sleep yesterday and my hand was healthy, and I woke up and it was paralysed. ‘A’ishah said, “How is that?” She said, “I had wealthy parents, and my Father used to pay zakat, host guests, and give to beggars, and he did not see any good except that he would do it. As for my mother, she was stingy, and did nothing good with my Father’s wealth. Then my Father died, and my mother died only two months after him. So I saw my Father in a dream last night, and he was wearing two yellow garments and in front of him was a flowing river. I said, “Father, what is this?’ He said, “Whoever does good in this life will see it, this is what Allah has given me.” I said, “What has happened to my mother?” He asked, “Your Mother dies?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “She has been turned away from me, so look for her on your left” So I turned to my left, and I saw my mother standing naked, covering her lower half with a rag and in her hand was a piece of fat. She was calling out, “My sadness, my thirst&#8217; When she became tired she would rub the fat with her hand and then lick it, while in front of her was a flowing river. I said, ‘O mother, why are you crying out of thirst, and there is a flowing river in front of you?’ She said, ‘I am not allowed to drink from it.’ I said, Can I give you some of the water?’ She said, ‘I wish you would do that.’ So I filled my hand with water and let her drink, and when she swallowed it I heard a voice on my right, ‘Whoever has given this woman water, may his hand be paralysed,’ and they repeated it twice. Then I awoke and my hand was paralysed, and I am not able to do anything with it. ‘A’ishah asked: ‘Did you recognise the rag she was wearing?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Mother of the Believers, it was exactly the same one I saw her wearing, for I had never seen my mother give anything as charity, except that one day my Father slaughtered a bull. So a beggar came to ask for some, so my mother gave him a bone that had some fat on it. And I saw one day that a beggar asked her for charity, so she gave him that exact rag.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;ishah (radiy Allaahu anha) said, Allah is the Most Great! Allah has told the truth, and the Messenger has delivered the message.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;So whoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it,<br />
And whoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221;</strong></span><br />
[al-Azalzalah (99): 7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was nararted by Hafiz Abu Musa al-Madani with a good isnad.[21]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and said; &#8220;I am hard pressed by hunger.<span class="hadithgreentxt">&#8221;</span> He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sent a word to one of his wives who replied: &#8220;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have nothing except water.&#8221; Then he sent the same message to another (wife) and received the same reply. He sent this message to all of them (i.e., his wives) and received the same reply. Then he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,<span class="hadithtxt"> &#8220;Who will entertain this (man) as guest?&#8221;</span> One of the Ansar said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I will<span class="hadithgreentxt">.</span>&#8221; So he took him home and said to his wife: &#8220;Serve the guest of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Ansari asked his wife: &#8220;Have you got anything?&#8221; She answered: &#8220;Nothing, except a little food for the children.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Keep them busy with something, and when they ask for food put them to sleep. When the guest enters, extinguish the light and give him the impression that we are also eating.&#8221; So they sat down and the guest ate and they passed the night hungry. When he came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in the morning, he said to him,<span class="hadithtxt"> &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allah admired what you did with your guest last night.</strong></span>&#8221;</span></p>
<p>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="qurantxt">&#8220;And give them (Emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that.&#8221;</span></strong>(59:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="qurantxt">&#8220;<strong>And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the poor, the orphan, and the captive</strong>.&#8221;</span> (76:8)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated that:He heard Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three men, amongst those who came before you, set out until night came and they reached a cave, so they entered it. A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: &#8216;Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon, one of them said: &#8216;O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock&#8217;. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape.</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">The next said: &#8216;O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.&#8217; The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out.</p>
<p class="hadith_narrated" style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: &#8216;O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.&#8217; The rock slipped aside and they got out walking freely&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Narrate from the Banoo Israa·eel. and there is no harm, because amazing things happened amongst them.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began narrating, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt; A group from the Banoo Israa.eel went out until they came to one of their grave- yards, and they said: &#8220;If only we were to pray two rak`ahs, and make supplication to Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic -that He should bring out for us a man from those who have died, so that we could ask him about death.&#8221; He said: So they did so. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, whilst they were in that condition, a man put his head out from a grave from those graves. He was a brownish person, with the mark of prostration between his eyes. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said “O people what do you want with me? <span style="color:#993300;">I died a hundred years ago, and the heat of death has not subsided from me until just now</span>. So supplicate to Allaah- the Mighty and Majesticfor me so that He should return me to being just as I was”.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Reported by Ahmad in &#8220;az-Zuhd&#8221;(16-17), Ibn Abee Shaybah in &#8220;alMusannaf&#8221;(9/62)-without the story, and likewise by al-Bazzaar in his &#8220;Musnad&#8221;(1/108/192: &#8220;Kashful-Astaar&#8221;): from ar-Rabee` ibn Sa`d al-Ju`fee :he heard it from `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit: from Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8230;, and he mentioned it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The narrators in this chain are reliable, however there is a disagreement about whether Ibn Saabit heard from Jaabir. So Ibn Ma`een was asked: &#8220;Did `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit hear from Jaabir?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;No.&#8221; However Ibn Abee Haatim confirmed his having heard from him, so he said in &#8220;al-Jarh watTa`deel&#8221; (2/2/240): “He narrated from `Umar, but this is mursal; and from Jaabir, and it is connected.” And this is contrary to what he quoted in &#8220;alMaraaseel&#8221; (p.84), and this is more correct, because of what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth was reported by `Abd Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab minalMusnad&#8221; (q.152/1), with its full wording, and likewise by Wakee` in &#8220;azZuhd&#8221;(1/280/56), and by Ibn Abee Daawood in &#8220;al-Ba`th&#8221;(30/5), and in it Ibn Saabit clearly states that he had it narrated to him directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>the hadeeth is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;</strong>, and the chain is fully connected, and all praise is for Allaah&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">***</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[From &#8220;<em>Saheehus-Seeratin-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp.80-81), Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; verified edition of al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; &#8220;<em>as-Seeratun-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216;.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja`ee, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went off one day, and I was with him, until we entered a synagogue of the Jews (in al-Madeenah, on a festival day of theirs, and they disliked our entering upon them), and he said (to them):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">O assembly of Jews! Show me twelve men who will bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and Allaah will remove from every Jew beneath the sky the Anger which He has upon them</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; He said: So they remained silent; no one responded to him. Then he repeated it, but no one responded to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You have refused, but, by Allaah ! I am indeed ‘al-Haashir’</strong> (the Prophet after whom the people will be gathered), and I am <strong>‘al-`Aaqib’</strong> (the final Prophet), and I am<strong> ‘an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa’</strong> (the chosen Prophet): whether you believe or reject the truth</span>.</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he departed, and I was with him, until (when) we had almost left, a man behind us said: &#8220;Stay as you are, O Muhammad!&#8217; Then that man said: &#8221; What sort of man do you people know me to be amongst you, O company of Jews?&#8217; They said: &#8220;By Allaah! We do not know there to be any man amongst us who knows Allaah&#8217;s Scripture better than you; nor who has better understanding of the religion than you; nor than your father before you; nor than your grandfather before your father.&#8217; He said: &#8220;Then I testify for him, by Allaah, that he is indeed the Prophet of Allaah, whom you find in the Tawraat [Torah].” They said: &#8220;You have lied!&#8217; Then they rebutted his saying, and they said evil things about him, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You people have lied. Your saying will never be accepted. Just now you were praising him with the good that you were praising him with; but when he believed you called him a liar, and said what you have said. Your saying will never be accepted</strong></span>.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So we departed, and we were three: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), myself, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah -the Most High- sent down regarding him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Do you see: if this Qur·aan is from Allaah, and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Israa&#8217;eel testifies to its like, and believes in it; and you haughtily reject it; then Allaah does not guide the wrongdoing Disbelievers&#8221;</span></strong>  [ Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Reported by Ahmad (6/25), and the additions are his; and by al-Haakim (3/415-416), and he said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of the two Shaikhs&#8217;! And adhDhahabee agreed with him! But it is only to the standard of Muslim, since al-Bukhaaree did not report the narrations of Safwaan ibn `Amr except in his &#8220;al-Adabul-Mufrad&#8217;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>IMAAM AL-BUKHAAREE’S -rahimahullaah- NARRATION:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree narrated (no.3329): from Anas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abdullaah ibn Salaam heard of the arrival of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) at AlMadeenah, so he came to him and said: &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which nobody but a Prophet will know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;What is the first of the signs of the Hour? And what will be the first food, which the people of Paradise will eat? And on account of what does a child resemble its father; and on account of what does a child resemble its maternal uncles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «Jibreel has just informed me of them.» He said: `Abdullaah said: &#8220;He is the enemy to the Jews from amongst the Angels.&#8217; Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«As for the first of the signs of the Hour, then it will be a fire, which gathers the people from the east to the west. As for the first food which the people of Paradise will eat, then it will be the extra lobe of the liver of the fish. As for the resemblance of the child, then when the man has intercourse with the woman and his semen outstrips the fluid of the woman, then the child will resemble him; and if her fluid outstrips, then the resemblance will be towards her.» </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Then he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The Jews are a people who are great liars: if they know about my Islaam before you ask them, then they will lie about me to you.&#8217; So the Jews came, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam entered the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What sort of a man is `Abdullaah ibn Salaam amongst you?» They said: &#8220;He is the most knowledgeable one of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable one from amongst us; and he is the best one of us, and the son of the best one of us.&#8217; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What would you think if `Abdullaah were to accept Islaam?» They said: &#8220;May Allaah preserve him from that.&#8217; So `Abdullaah came out to them and said: &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; So they said: &#8220;He is the most evil one of us, and the son of the most evil one of us&#8217;, and they spoke against him&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF `ABDULLAAH IBN SALAAM -radiyallaahu `anhu:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn Salaam ibn al-Haarith, al-Israa·eelee, Aboo Yoosuf. He was previously a confederate of Banoo `Awf ibn al-Khazraj. He accepted Islaam when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came to al-Madeenah. He was present at the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), and the battles after it. He was present with `Umar at the conquest of Jerusalem, and at alJaabiyah. He died in al-Madeenah in 43 H. <span style="color:#999999;">[[ ref. &#8220;Tahdheebut-Tahdheeb&#8217; of al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr]]</span> Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) bore witness that he will be a person of Paradise, as reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3812) and Muslim (no. 2483) from Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; who said: &#8220;I never heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say about anyone who still walked upon the earth that he was a person of Paradise, except `Abdullaah ibn Salaam. He said: And this Aayah came down concerning him:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And a witness from the children of Israa·eel testifies to its like</span>&#8220;</strong> [Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee reported (no. 3804) from Mu`aadh ibn Jabal -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will be the tenth of ten in Paradise</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [ Declared &#8220;Saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That death approached Aboo Dharr, whilst he was at ar-Rabadhah [2], so his wife wept. He said: “What causes you to weep?” She said: “I weep because I cannot do anything for you, and I have<strong> no cloth large enough to shroud you in</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Do not weep, for I heard Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say one day, [and I was with him, in a group of people]: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">A man from amongst you will certainly die in a desert area: a group of the Believers will be present at his funeral.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; He said: “ So everyone who was along with me in that gathering has died within a group of people or separately [3] , and none from them remain except for me; and I am in a part of the desert, dying. So go out and watch the road, for you shall soon see what I say, for, by Allaah! I have not lied, nor have I been lied to.” She said: “ How can that occur, when the people travelling for Hajj have ceased?” He said: “ Watch the road.” He said: So whilst she was doing so, a group of people could be seen moving along quickly upon their riding camels, (looking) as if they were vultures [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people came, until they stood over her, and said: “What is wrong with you?” She said:“ There is a man of the Muslims for you to shroud, and thus be rewarded for it.” They said: “Who is he?” She said: “Aboo Dharr.” So they declared that may their fathers and mothers be a ransom for him, and they hung their whips upon the necks of their camels, and they hastened to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “Receive glad tidings, for you are the group about whom Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said what he said. So today I have entered the morning as you see me; and if I had a garment of mine that were sufficient to shroud me in, then I would not be shrouded in anything else besides it. So I implore you, by Allaah, let not a man from amongst you shroud me who has been a chief, a governor, or an official messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the people had attained something from that, except for a youth from the Ansaar who was with the people. He said: “ I am your companion: there are two garments in my travelling bag that were woven by my mother, and the newest of my garments are these two that I am wearing.” He said: “ You are my companion, [so you shroud me].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Reported by Ahmad, and the wording is his, and its narrators are the narrators of the &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;; and by al-Bazzaar -with its like, in abridged form&#8230;”. Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8220;Saheehut-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb&#8221; (3/295-296/no.3314) of Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; rahimahullaah, and the additions in square brackets were included by the Shaikh from the original hadeeth in the &#8220;Musnad&#8221; of Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] A village at a distance of three days journey from al-Madeenah, Aboo Dharr -radiyallaahu `anhu- took up residence here until his death in 32 H (&#8220;Mu`jamul-Buldaan&#8221;:1/24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaikh al-Albaanee&#8221;s checked edition has the word &#8220;furqah&#8221;(separately), as occurs in some of the editions of the &#8220;Musnad&#8221;. In other editions of Musnad Ahmad, and in the &#8220;Daar ulHadeeth, Cairo edition of &#8220;at-Targheeb&#8221; there occurs here &#8220;qaryah&#8221; (a village); and in &#8220;alFathur-Rabbaanee&#8221; (no. 11, 916) there occurs &#8220;rifqah&#8221;(amongst companions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: “ Perhaps the angle of their resemblance to vultures was on account of their having the dirt of travelling upon them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the story that contains admonition and reflection in it, then it is that which is reported in the biography of &#8216;<strong>Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee</strong> in the &#8220;Thiqaat&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee, who said: &#8220;There used to be a beautiful woman in Makkah who was married. One day she looked at herself in the mirror and said to her husband: &#8216;Do you think there is anyone that can look at this face and not be enticed by it?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So she enquired: &#8216;Who?&#8217; He said: &#8221;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer.&#8217; So she said: &#8216;Grant me permission so that I may go entice him.&#8217; He said: &#8216;I give you permission.&#8217; So she went to see him and asked him for a fatwa (religious verdict). So he went with her to a part of Al-Masjid AlHaraam and sat in privacy with her. Then she uncovered her face, so that it looked like half of a moon. So he said to her: &#8216;O slave of Allaah, fear Allaah!'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of Al-Hilyah mentioned this story from &#8220;<strong>Ath-Thiqaat</strong>&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee in his biography of &#8216;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee. <strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> also mentioned it in his book on Hijaab using it as a proof for the niqaab (face-veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of benefit that we can derive from this great noble scholar&#8217;s rebuking of that woman when she uncovered her face in front of him is that: The Taabi&#8217;een used to hold that a woman uncovering herself by unveiling her face in front of male strangers was a serious crime, which needed to be changed and great efforts needed to be made to terminate it. In fact, the matter should be this way, for indeed a person that looks at a woman&#8217;s face and hands, i.e. a woman he is prohibited from looking at, is enjoying the area of the body with the greatest temptation and the most severe in danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Posted from e-Book</strong>: <a title="The Obligation of Veiling the Face and Hands – Shaykh Zayd Al-Madkhalee" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/21/the-obligation-of-veiling-the-face-and-hands-shaykh-zayd-al-madkhalee/">The Obligation of Veiling the Face and Hands</a> – Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (rahimahullaah)</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The following is posted from Riyadus Saliheen Published by Dar-us-Salam</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;One of the earlier Prophets who was out on an expedition proclaimed among his people that no man should follow him who had married a woman with whom he wished to cohabit but had not yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the roofs, or who had bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and was expecting them to produce young. He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man&#8217;s hand stuck to his, he said: &#8220;There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me&#8221;. (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: &#8220;The thief is among you&#8221;. They brought him a head of gold like a cow&#8217;s head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Commentary</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1. In the opinion of Imam As-Suyuti, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) referred to in this Hadith was Prophet Yusha` bin Nun (Joshua). His conduct shows that it is necessary to make suitable arrangements for the worldly needs of those who are engaged in the Cause of Allah so that they can concentrate on their struggle without any distraction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2. The lawfulness of the booty of war fought in the way of Allah is a specialty of the Muslim Ummah. Before the advent of Islam (the Shar&#8217;iah of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)), the booty of war which was free from dishonesty used to be consumed by fire. This Hadith also confirms the miracle of the Prophet Yusha&#8217; (Joshua) in which the movement of the sun was stopped until he had conquered the village.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtoom</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On their way back to Madinah, at a large sand hill, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam divided the spoils equally among the fighters after he had taken Al-Khums (one-fifth). When they reached As-Safra&#8217;, he ordered that two of the prisoners should be killed. They were An-Nadr bin Al-Harith and &#8216;Uqbah bin Abi Muait, because they had persecuted the Muslims in Makkah, and harboured deep hatred towards Allaah and His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam . In a nutshell, they were criminals of war in modern terminology, and their execution was an awesome lesson to oppressors. &#8216;Uqbah forgot his pride and cried out, &#8220;Who will look after my children O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam answered, &#8220;The Fire (of Hell).&#8221; Did &#8216;Uqbah not remember the day when he had thrown the entrails of a sheep onto the head of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam while he was prostrating himself in prayer, and Fatimah had come and washed it off him? He had also strangled the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam with his cloak if it had not been for Abu Bakr to intervene and release the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam . The heads of both criminals were struck off by Alee bin Abi TAleeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam exhorted the Muslims to treat the prisoners so well to such an extent that the captors used to give the captives their bread (the more valued part of the meal) and keep the dates for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prisoners of war constituted a problem awaiting resolution because it was a new phenomenon in the history of Islaam. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam consulted Abu Bakr and Umar bin Al-Khattab as to what he should do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr suggested that he should ransom them, explaining this by saying: &#8220;They are after all our relatives, and this money would give us strength against the disbelievers, moreover, Allaah could guide them to Islaam.&#8221; Umar advised killing them, saying, &#8220;They are the leaders of Kufr (disbelief).&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam preferred Abu Bakr&#8217;s suggestion to that of Umar&#8217;s. The following day, Umar called on the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and Abu Bakr to see them weeping. He showed extreme astonishment and inquired about the situation so that he might weep if it was worth weeping for, or else he would feign weeping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allaah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allaah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.&#8221;</strong> [Qur&#8217;aan 8:67-68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The previous Divine ordainment went as follows,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom) or ransom.&#8221; </strong> [Qur&#8217;aan 47:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which included an area providing permission to take ransom, that is why no penalty was imposed. They were rebuked only for taking prisoners before subduing all the land of disbelief. Apart from this, the polytheists taken to Madinah were not only prisoners of war but rather archcriminals of war whom modern war penal law brings to justice to receive their due sentence of death or prison for life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ransom for the prisoners ranged between 4000 and 1000 Dirhams in accordance with the captive&#8217;s financial situation. Another form of ransom assumed an educational dimension; most of the Makkans, unlike the Madinese, were literate and so each prisoner who could not afford the ransom was entrusted with ten children to teach them the art of writing and reading. Once the child had been proficient enough, the instructor would be set free. Another clan of prisoners were released unransomed on grounds of being hard up. Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , paid the ransom of her husband Abul-&#8216;As with a necklace. The Muslims released her prisoner and returned the necklace in deference to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam but on condition that Abul-&#8216;As allow Zainab to migrate to Madinah, which he actually did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In captivity, there was also an eloquent orator called Suhail bin &#8216;Amr. Umar suggested that they pull out his front teeth to disable him from speaking, but the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam turned down his suggestion for fear Quraish should retAleeate in the same manner on one hand, and on the other for fear of Allaah&#8217;s wrath on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d bin An-Nu&#8217;man, a lesser pilgrim detained in Makkah, was released in return for setting Abu Sufyan&#8217;s son, a captive, free.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Story of the 600-700 Jews Beheaded by the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam at Bani Quraiza in 5 AH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bani Quraiza was a tribe of Jews in a district of Madinah that betrayed the Muslims and sided with the enemy during the Battle of Ahzaab (also known as the Battle of the Confederates and the Battle of the Trench). The Sealed Nectar describes what happened to them immediately after the Battle of Ahzaab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Archangel Gabriel, on the very day the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came back to Madinah after the previous battle, and while he was washing in Umm Salama&#8217;s house, visited him asking that he should unsheathe his sword and head for the habitation of the seditious Banu Quraiza and fight them. Gabriel noted that he with a procession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , immediately summoned the prayer caller and ordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza, institued Ibn Umm Maktum as a ruler of Madinah, and entrusted the banner of war to Alee bin Abi TAleeb who marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews abusing the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , who on his part set out at the head of three thousand infantry men and thirty horsemen of Ansar (Helpers) and Muhajireen (Emigrants). On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due. Some Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others offered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam objected to neither. When they reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts. Seeing this terrible situation they were in, the chief of the Jews Ka&#8217;b bin Asad offered them three alternatives: to embrace Islaam, and consequently their life, wealth, women and children would be in full security, and reminded them that such behaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about the veracity of Muhammad&#8217;s Prophethood; to kill their children and women and then challenge the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and his followers to the sword to either exterminate the Muslims or be exterminated, or as a third possibility to take Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and his people by surprise on Saturday &#8211; a day mutually understood to witness no fighting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of those alternatives appealed them, so their chief, angrily and indignantly, turned to them saying: &#8220;You have never been decisive in decision-making since you were born.&#8221; The gloomy future already visible, they made contacts with some Muslims, who had maintained good relation with them, in order to learn about their fate in the light of the current circumstances. They requested that Abu Lubaba be despatched to them for advice. On his arrival, the men began to implore, women and children to cry desperately. In answer to their demand for advice he pointed to his throat saying it was homicide awaiting them. He then immediately reAleezed that he had betrayed the Prophet&#8217;s trust, so he headed directly for the mosque in Madinah and tied himself to a wooden tall pole swearing that no one would untie him save the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , and added that he would never enter the habitation of Banu Quraiza in recompense for the deadly mistake he made. When the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was informed of this incident, he said, &#8221; I would have begged Allaah to forgive him if he had asked me, but since he had tied himself out of his own free will, then it was Allaah Who would turn to him in forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews of Banu Quraiza could have endured the siege much longer because food and water were plentifully available and their strongholds were greatly fortified, whereas the Muslims were in the wild bare land suffering a lot from cold and hunger, let alone too much fatigue consequent on endless warfare operations that had started even before the battle of Confederates. Nevertheless, this was a battle of nerves, for Allaah had cast fear in the the Jews&#8217; hearts, and their morale had almost collapsed especially when two Muslim heroes, Alee bin Abi TAleeb and Az-Zubair bin &#8216;Awwam proceeded with Alee swearing that he would never stop until he had either stormed their garrisons or been martyred like Hamza (a former Muslim martyr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the light of this reluctance, they had nothing except to comply with the Messenger&#8217;s judgement. The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ordered that the men should be handcuffed, and this was done under the supervision of Muhammad bin Salamah Al-Ansari while the women and children were isolated in confinement. Thereupon Al-Aws tribe interceded begging the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to be lenient toward them. He suggested that Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh, a former ally, be deputed to give verdict about them, and they agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d meanwhile stayed behind in Madinah due to a serious wound he sustained in the Confederates Battle. He was summoned and brought on a donkey. On his way to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , the Jews used to exhort him to be lenient in his judgement on account of former friendship. Sa&#8217;d remained silent but when they persisted he uttered: &#8220;It is time for Sa&#8217;d not to be afraid of the blame of the blamers.&#8221; On hearing this decisive attitude, some of them returned to Madinah waiting for a desperate doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On arrival, he Aleeghted with the help of some men. He was informed that the Jews had agreed to accept his verdict about them. He immediately wondered if his judgement would pass on all the people present, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam included, turning his face away in honour of him. The reply was positive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He decided that all the able-bodied male persons belonging to the tribe should be killed, women and children taken prisoners and their wealth divided among the Muslim fighters. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted his judgement saying that Sa&#8217;d had adjudged by the Command of Allaah. In fact, the Jews deserved that severe punitive action for the ugly treachery they had harboured against Islaam, and the large arsenal they have amassed and which consisted of one thousand and five hundred swords, two thousand spears, three hundred armours and five hundred shields, all of which went into the hands of the Muslims. Trenches were dug in the bazaar of Madinah and a number of Jews between six and seven hundred were beheaded therein. Hot beds of intrigue and treachery were thus exterminated once and for all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Huyai, a chief criminal of war, a devil of Bani Nadir and Safiyah&#8217;s father, had joined the ranks of Banu Quraiza when Quraish and Ghatfan defected, was admitted into the audience of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam with his hands tied to his neck with a rope. In audacious defiance, he declared obstinate enmity to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam but admitted that Allaah&#8217;s Will was to be fulfilled and added that he was resigned to his fate. He was ordered to sit down, and was beheaded on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only one woman of the Jews was killed because she had killed a Muslim warrior by flinging a grinding stone upon him. A few elements of the enemy embraced Islaam and their lives, wealth and children were spared. As for the spoils of the war, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam divided them, after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s injunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter. Women captives were sent to Najd to be bartered with horses and weaponry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the war with Banu Quraiza had been settled and they had been defeated, Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh&#8217;s wish was gratified and he gave his last breath. In response to his supplication &#8216;Aishah narrated, Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s wounds began to bleed from the front part of his neck while he was in his tent which the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had pitched for him in the mosque so that he would be in close proximity in order to inquire about and watch his well-being closely. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s tent, there was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you? Lo! it was Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s wound that was bleeding and he died thereon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had said: <em> &#8220;The Throne of the Compassionate shook for the death of Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh.&#8221;</em> When his bier was carried, At-Tirmidhi said: The hypocrites alleged it was too light. The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam retorted: <em> &#8220;The angels are carrying him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the process of the sieze laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin Suwaid was killed when a women of the Jews dropped the grinding stone on him, and another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of &#8216;Ukasha, died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights. His wife used to untie him at prayer times and then he tied himself again to the pole. One early morning, Allaah the All-Forgiving revealed a verse to the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to the effect that Allaah had turned to Abu Lubaba with forgiveness. The Muslims rushed to release him but he insisted that the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam himself do it. And this was done shortly before the morning prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Military Expedition took place in the month of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah in the year five Hijri (5AH), and the siege of Banu Quraiza&#8217;s forts lasted for 25 days. The Chapter of Confederates (Qur&#8217;aan, Surah 33)was revealed containing Allaah&#8217;s Words concerning the basic issues relating to the believers and hypocrites during the battle of the Confederates, and the consequences of the treachery and breaching of covenants by the Jews.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah said:Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, &#8220;I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic.&#8221; So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, &#8220;Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.&#8217; And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.&#8221;&#8217; So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, &#8220;Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better.&#8221; So, he took a stone and said, &#8220;O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).&#8221; Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, &#8220;O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.&#8221;The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, &#8220;All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you.&#8221; So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, &#8220;Who gave you back your sight&#8221;The courtier replied, &#8220;My Lord.&#8221; The king then said, &#8220;I did&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;No, my Lord and your Lord &#8211; Allah&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Do you have another Lord beside me&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah.&#8221; The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, &#8220;O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases&#8221;He said, &#8221; I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Me&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;Do you have another Lord besides me&#8221;The boy answered, &#8221; My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221; So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, &#8220;Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.&#8221; They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, &#8221; O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish.&#8221; So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, &#8221; What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Allah saved me from them.&#8221; So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, &#8220;If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him.&#8221; So, they took him out to sea and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish.&#8221; So they were all drowned in the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, &#8220;What did your companions do&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;Allah, saved me from them.&#8221; Then he said to the king, &#8220;You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;And what is that&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8217; If you do this, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8221; The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, &#8220;We believe in the Lord of the boy!&#8217;’ Then it was said to the king, &#8220;Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).&#8221;So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, &#8220;Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.&#8221; They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her,&#8221;Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, &#8220;Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p>

And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.) (85:4-9)</td>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah &#8212; that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis).</p>

Transcribed by &#8211; Fatimah bint Mohamed min Canada</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillahi rahmani raheem, alhamdulilahi rabil ‘alameen, wa sallallahu ‘alaah nabee-ina Muhammadin wa ‘alaah aleehi wasahbihi wasalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one fruit of the da’wah for the salif as salih, it was manifested in the baaytul maqdis, in the land of the Prophets in Palestine, May Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’alaa) relief it from the injustice of the Jews. In the beginning we remind ourselves of what Shaykh Albani (rahimullah) used to repeat, saying, “Alhamdulilahi ‘alaah n’matil islam, wa sunnah, alhamdulilah ‘alaah n’matil islaam, wa sunnah.” (All praises due to Allah,  for the favor of Islam, and sunnah, for the favor of Islam which Allah bestowed, and the favor of as sunnah which he bestowed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here’s the story of the formal priest or monk by the formal name, Daniel of Rome. And his current name is Ibrahim. May Allah persevere him and give him steadfastness on the path of uprightness. He said I was an imam from the people of Rome, son of a rich, very rich family. Who lived his life in enjoyment and comfort, childhood and youth. Much of my youth was spent in enjoyment with friends, enjoying cars, and prestigious ones. And I had wealth with me and money, could buy what I liked. Nothing was short for me. But even from that age, I had a feeling that there is something really missing in this life. And that there is something, a kind of emptiness. That I needed to fill. So not all of this means of life which are handed to me, were my goal and target. So I went into the direction of deen, of religion. And I began to read the injeel. The gospel. And go to church. And filled myself with reciting religious Christian books. From these books I began to find some answers, to my questions. But yet, incomplete and imperfect. I used to get up early each day, and go to the beach. Contemplating and pondering on the sea and reading the books and praying. Two months after this, I became convinced that I am unable to carry on a normal life after becoming religious. So I went to my father and I told him I cannot continue to work with him and I went to my mother, and my brothers, and I told them I decided to leave them and I prepared my luggage and took the train. Not knowing where I was going.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I arrived at the city of Bologna and I joined a monastery there and went on top of a high mountain and stayed on its top for about a month. Speaking to no one. Only reading and worshipping. I stayed for almost three years, moving from one monastery to another. Reading and worshipping.  Not like the other priests or monks who couldn’t leave their monasteries because I did not give the promise to become a monk in a specific monastery. And this promise normally prevents many from leaving these monasteries which they assign themselves to. After this trip, I decided to make another trip in other countries, other than Italy. So I began my journey. Long journey. From Italy. Passing by Slovenia,  Hungary, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and from there to India. All in land. I heard the Adhan in Turkey. And I also heard the Adhan in Cairo, in a previous trip. However, this time the Adhan in Turkey affected me. And I loved it. And on my way back, at the Iranian/Pakistani borders, I came to encounter a Shiite person who invited me with his friends and began discussing Islam to me in accordance to the Shiite concepts. And they mentioned to me, the twelve Imams and they didn’t mention to me the Islam. The principle of Islam. Rather they focused on Shiiism and Ali (radiAllahu Ta’alaa anhu  &#8211; May Allah be pleased with him). And their awaiting of their Imam for their deliverance who will come in their opinion to deliver mankind. All of these discussions did not arouse an interest in me. And there were not answers to the many questions I’m searching for, concerning the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Shiite person presented me with the offer to learn Islam in the city of Qum, the Iranian city, of Qum. And as you know, the city of Qum is the leading city of their schools, of shiism or rafidaah. So they offered that I stay with them at Qum for three months. However, I continued my journey and I left them. and I went to India. And when I stepped from the train, I saw people carrying lamps in the early dawn hours. Rushing in the direction of the city’s center. So I followed them. and I saw them making tawaff, circulating around a kaaf made of gold. There I realized that India is not place for me to look for what I was looking for. Afterwards, I returned to Italy. And I stayed one month, one complete month at the hospital. And I almost lost my life because of the illness I carried from India but Allah (subhanahu wa Ta’ala) preserved me, walhamdulilah and all praise is due to him. I left the hospital to my home. And I began to think about the next steps in my long journey. The steps I should take. So I became more determined to continue my search for the truth. I returned to the monastery and I began to practice the monk’s life in one of the monasteries in Rome. Where the chief monk asked me to deliver the speech of the word, and the promise on that night. I really thought deeply and in the morning I decided that I’m not going to give them the speech and this promise. So I left the monastery. I felt that there was something inside me, pushing me, to get out from the monastery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, afterwards, I decided to go to al Quds, Jerusalem because of my belief in its holiness. So I left to al Quds, in land, passing through the same countries, I passed earlier in my journey to India. Until I reached Syria, Lebanon, ‘Amaan, and al Quds where I stayed for 1 week. Thereafter, I returned to Italy. And I had more and more questions. I returned to my home, and I opened the injeel, the gospel. And I felt that it was a must for me to read the gospel from the beginning. So I began with the Tura, going through the narrations of the Prophets of Bani Israel, the children of Israel, and through this stage, the true meanings of the message which Allah (subhaanahu wa Ta’alaa) revealed  became to crystallize. And I began to feel it. And this brought other questions which I did not find the answers to. I tried to find answers to these questions, through my search in my library filled with books connected to the gospel and the Torah. Thereupon, I remembered the sound of Adhan which I used to hear through my trips and thereupon, I realized that the Muslims believe in one god, no other god, except Him. and this is the thing which I really believed, so I said it is a must therefore that I should, learn Islam. So I began collecting books about Islam. And with me was the glorious Qur’an, translated into the Italian language. Which I bought on one of my trips. And after I read these books, I realized Islam is not as understood with many in the West as a religion of killing, and domination. Rather I found it as a religion of Rahma, of mercy. And I found it close in meaning, with the true meaning of Torah and the gospel.  So I decided to return to al Quds because I believed that the Quds was a place of the previous messages received by the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However this time, I took the plane from Italy to Bayt al Maqdis. And I dwelt in a place used by the monks and those who come to the archery, the Armenian one in the old city. I didn’t carry in my suitcase except few clothes, and the translated meaning of the Qur’an to the Italian language, the gospel and the Torah. So I began to read more and more. And compare between what’s in the Qur’an and what’s in the Torah, and the gospel. So I realized it was close to the message of Mosaa, and ‘Isaa (‘alayhimu salam), the True one. So I began to speak to some Muslims, asking them about Islam. Until I met my dear friend, Waseem Hajeer. And we talked about Islam. And I met many friends, and they used to explain Islam to me. And after that, brother Waseem said to me that he will arrange for me a meeting and one of the callers to Allah  in al Quds. So the meeting was with the dear brother Amjad Salham. And we had a good talk about Islam. And one of the most things that really affected me was the story of the honorable companion, Salman al Fareesi, may Allah be pleased with him. because of the resemblance of my story to his, in terms of searching for the truth. Another meeting took place with brother Amjad and his companions. And from them was fadeelatu Shaykh, Hisham al ‘rif, hafidahullah. And as you know, Hisham al ‘rif, was on the path of the Salaf, May Allah persevere him and that he teaches at the masjid al Aqsa at the Quds. There a conversation between me and him, about Islam and its greatness took place. And I had some questions and he answered them. and I continued to visit with Amjad and Amjad used to clarify many of the issues to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon I had two choices. Either I follow upon the truth, or reject it. And I could not reject after I believed that Islam is the right path. And during this time, I was sitting alone, feeling that the moment has come to utter kalimatu Tawheed. The statement of Tawhid. And at the station of Tawhid and to utter the shahadah. And my brother Amjad came, and the time for Adhan for Salaatu Duhr, had commenced. Thereupon I uttered the Shahadah, ash hadu an la illaha ilal lah, wa ash hadu ana muhammadan rasoolulah. Brother Amjad hugged me and congratulated me on Islam. And we made Sujood of thankfulness of Allah, for this n’maah. And he asked me to make Ghusl, take a bath, and go to masjid al Aqsa, for suraatu duhr. And after the salaah was finished, I met the musaleen, the people praying, with the testimony of la illaha ilal lah, wa muhammadan rasoolulah, which Allah has bestowed upon me, and afterwards, I began seeking knowledge, and Allah (subhaanahu wa Ta’alaa) guided me to seek knowledge on the path upon which the Messenger (sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam) and his companions, May Allah pleased with them. walhamdulilah, ‘aalal islami, wa sunnah. And all praise to Allah for Islam and sunnah. Wa sallallahu ‘alaa Muhammadiin wa ‘alaah aleehi wa asahbihi ajma’een. This is the story of Brother Ibrahim, formerly Daniel. The former priest or monk of Rome, and his acceptance of Islam, after the long search for the truth. We ask Allah (subhanahu wa Ta’ala) to accept from him and to give him steadfastness, and to give us steadfastness with him on the deen of the truth. And to guide those who are seeking the truth as well. Walhamdulilahi rabil ‘alameen, wa sallalahu ‘alaa nabee-inaa Muhammad, wa ‘alaah aleehi wa sahbihi wa salim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement; (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying; (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.246. Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa When they said to a Prophet of theirs, &#8220;Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allah&#8217;s way.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you&#8221; They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)&#8221; But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said that the Prophet (mentioned in the Ayah 2:246 above) is Shamwil (Samuel). Wahb bin Munabbih said: The Children of Israel remained on the straight path for a period of time after Moses. They then innovated in the religion and some of them even worshipped the idols. Yet, there were always Prophets sent among them who would command them to work righteous deeds, refrain from doing evil and who would rule them according to the commands of the Torah. When they (Israelites) committed the evil that they committed, Allah caused their enemies to overwhelm them, and many fatalities fell among them as a consequence. Their enemies also captured a great number of them, and took over large areas of their land. Earlier, anyone who would fight the Israelites would lose, because they had the Torah and the Tabut, which they inherited generation after generation ever since the time of Moses, who spoke to Allah directly. Yet, the Israelites kept indulging in misguidance until some king took the Tabut from them during a battle. That king also took possession of the Torah, and only a few of the Israelites who memorized it remained. The prophethood halted among their various tribes and only a pregnant woman remained of the offspring of Lavi (Levi), in whom the prophethood still appeared. Her husband had been killed, so the Israelites kept her in a house so that Allah may give her a boy, who would be their Prophet. The woman also kept invoking Allah to grant her a boy. Allah heard her pleas and gave her a boy whom she called `Shamwil&#8217; meaning `Allah has heard my pleas.&#8217; Some people said that the boy&#8217;s name was Sham`un (Simeon), which also has a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As that boy grew, Allah raised him to be a righteous person. When he reached the age of prophethood, Allah revealed to him and commanded him to call (his people) to Him and to His Tawhid (Oneness). Shamwil called the Children of Israel (to Allah) and they asked him to appoint a king over them so that they could fight their enemies under his command. The kingship had also ended among them. Their Prophet said to them, &#8220;What if Allah appoints a king over you, would you fulfill your vow to fight under his command&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children&#8221;) meaning, `After our land had been confiscated and our children had been taken from us&#8217; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers) meaning, only a few of them kept their promise, but the majority abandoned Jihad and Allah has full knowledge of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(247. And their Prophet said to them, &#8220;Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Verily, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How can he be a king over us) meaning, how can he be the king for us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth) They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet answered them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah has chosen him above you) meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.&#8217; Their Prophet stated, &#8220;I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.&#8221; Further:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.&#8217; He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.) meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(248. And their Prophet said to them: &#8220;Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tabut, wherein is Sakinah (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet then proclaimed, &#8220;The sign of the blessings of Talut&#8217;s kingship over you is that Allah will give you back the Tabut (wooden box) that has been taken from you.&#8221; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah from your Lord) meaning, peace (or grace) and reassurance. `Abdur-Razzaq stated that Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah) means grace. In addition, Ar-Rabi` said that Sakinah means mercy. This is also the meaning given by Ibn `Abbas, as Al-`Awfi narrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir related that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, ) Meaning, Moses&#8217; staff and the remnants of the Tablets. This is the same Tafsir of Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Ikrimah, who added, &#8220;And also the Torah.&#8221; `Abdur-Razzaq said that he asked Ath-Thawri about the meaning of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said, &#8220;Some said that it contained a pot of manna and the remnants of the Tablets, while some others said that it contained (Moses&#8217;) staff and two shoes (and refer to 20:12).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;carried by the angels.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The angels came down while carrying the Tabut between the sky and the earth, until they placed it before Talut while the people were watching.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Tabut was brought to Talut&#8217;s house, so the people believed in the prophethood of Sham`un (Simeon) and obeyed Talut&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, in this is a sign for you) testifying to my truth in what I was sent with, my prophethood, and my command to you to obey Talut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you are indeed believers. ) in Allah and the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(249. Then when Talut set out with the army, he said: &#8220;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.&#8221; Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221; But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet Allah, said: &#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that Talut, the king of the Children of Israel, marched forth with his soldiers and the Israelites who obeyed him. His army was of eighty thousand then, according to As-Suddi, but Allah knows best. Talut said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will try you) meaning, He will test you with a river, which flowed between Jordan and Palestine, i.e. , the Shari`ah river, according to Ibn `Abbas and others. He continued,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me;) meaning, shall not accompany me today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.) meaning, there is no harm in this case. Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Whoever took some of it (the river&#8217;s water) in the hollow of his hand, quenched his thirst; as for those who drank freely from it, their thirst was not quenched.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib said, &#8220;We used to say that the Companions of Muhammad who accompanied him on the battle of Badr were more than three hundred and ten, just as many as the soldiers who crossed the river with Talut. Only those who believed crossed the river with him.&#8221; Al-Bukhari also reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that the Israelites (who remained with Saul) thought that they were few in the face of their enemy who were many then. So, their knowledgeable scholars strengthened their resolve by stating that Allah&#8217;s promise is true and that triumph comes from Allah Alone, not from the large numbers or the adequacy of the supplies. They said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(250. And when they advanced to meet Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience, and set firm our feet and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.&#8221;) (251. So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut (Goliath), and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom ﴿after the death of Talut and Samuel﴾ and Al-Hikmah (prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed. And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists).) (252. These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the faithful party, who were few under the command of Talut, faced their enemy, who were many under the command of Jalut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, send down patience on us from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and set firm our feet) meaning, against the enemy and save us from running away and from feebleness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave) meaning, they defeated and overwhelmed them by Allah&#8217;s aid and support. Then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Dawud killed Jalut)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Israelite accounts claimed that (Prophet) David killed Goliath with a slingshot that he had, which he launched at Goliath causing his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talut promised that whoever killed Jalut, would marry his daughter and would share his kingship and authority. He kept his promise. Later, the kingship was transferred to Prophet Dawud in addition to being granted Prophethood by Allah. So, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom) that Talut had and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Al-Hikmah) that comes with the prophethood, meaning, after Shamwil. ﴿Allah then said:﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and taught him of that which He willed.) meaning, what He willed of the knowledge that He bestowed on (Prophet) Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that if it were not for the fact that Allah checks one set of people with another, such as when Talut and the bravery of Dawud helped the Children of Israel (against Goliath), then people would have perished. Similarly, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and Masjids, wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would surely, have been pulled down.) (22:40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)) meaning, by His mercy and favor He fixes some of them by some others. Surely, Allah has the wisdom, the supreme authority and the clear proof against His creation in all of His actions and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah states, `These Ayat (verses) of Allah that We have narrated for you in truth conform to the exact manner that these stories have occurred and to the truth that still remain in the (Divine) Books that the scholars of the Children of Israel have and know. Allah said: O Muhammad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(you are)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(one of the Messengers (of Allah)) emphatically stating the truth of his prophet hood</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A History of Hajj (Pilgrimage)<br />
</strong>Invitation to Islam Newsletter, Issue 1, May 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj literally means &#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to set out for a place</strong></span>&#8216;. Islamically however it refers to the annual pilgrimage that Muslims make to Makkah with the intention of performing certain religious rites in accordance with the method prescribed by the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj and its rites were first ordained by Allaah in the time of the Prophet lbraaheem [Abraham] (alayhis-salaam) and he was the one who was entrusted by Allaah to build the Ka&#8217;ba &#8211; the House of Allaah &#8211; along with his son Ismaa&#8217;eel [Ishmael] at Makkah. Allaah described the Ka&#8217;ba and its building as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And remember when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the [Sacred] House [saying]: Associate not anything [in worship] with Me and purify My House for those who circumambulate it [i.e. perform tawaaf] and those who stand up for prayer and those who bow down and make prostration [in prayer etc.].&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah Al-Hajj 22:26</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After building the Ka&#8217;ba, Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) would come to Makkah to perform Hajj every year, and after his death, this practice was continued by his son</strong></span>. However, gradually with the passage of time, both the form and the goal of the Hajj rites were changed. As idolatry spread throughout Arabia , the Ka&#8217;ba lost its purity and idols were placed inside it. Its walls became covered with poems and paintings, including one of Jesus and his mother Maryam and eventually over 360 idols came to be placed around the Ka&#8217;ba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the Hajj period itself, the atmosphere around the sacred precincts of the Ka&#8217;ba was like a circus.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Men and women would go round the Ka&#8217;ba <strong>naked</strong>, arguing that they should present themselves before Allaah in the same condition they were born.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Their prayer became devoid of all sincere remembrance of Allaah and was instead reduced to a series of <strong>hand clapping, whistling and the blowing of horns</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Even the <strong>talbeeyah [2] was distorted</strong> by them with the following additions: <em>&#8216;No one is Your partner except one who is permitted by you. You are his Master and the Master of what he possesses&#8217;.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sacrifices were also made in the name of God. However, <strong>the blood of the sacrificed animals was poured onto the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and the flesh was hung from pillars around the Ka&#8217;ba</strong>, in the belief that Allaah demanded the flesh and blood of these animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Singing, drinking, adultery</strong> and other acts of immorality was rife amongst the pilgrims and the poetry competitions, which were held, were a major part of the whole Hajj event. In these competitions, poets would praise the bravery and splendour of their own tribesmen and tell exaggerated tales of the cowardice and miserliness of other tribes. Competitions in generosity were also staged where the chief of each tribe would set up huge cauldrons and feed the pilgrims, only so that they could become well-known for their extreme generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the people had totally abandoned the teachings of their forefather and leader Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). The House that he had made pure for the worship of Allaah alone, had been totally desecrated by the pagans and the rites which he had established were completely distorted by them. This sad state of affairs continued for nearly two and a half thousand years. But then after this long period, the time came for the supplication of Ibraaheem to be answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them your aayaat (verses) and instruct them in the book and the Wisdom and sanctify them. Verily you are the &#8216;Azeezul-Hakeem [the All-Mighty, the All-Wise].&#8221; </span>[<em>Surah Al-Baqarah 2:129</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sure enough, a man by the name of Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was born in the very city that Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) had made this supplication centuries earlier. For twenty-three years, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) spread the message of Tawheed [true monotheism] &#8211; the same message that Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets came with &#8211; and established the law of Allaah upon the land. He expended every effort into making the word of Allaah supreme and his victory over falsehood culminated in the smashing of the idols inside the Ka&#8217;ba which once again became the universal centre for the worshippers of the one True God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only did the Prophet rid the Ka&#8217;ba of all its impurities, but he also reinstated all the rites of Hajj which were established by Allaah&#8217;s Permission, in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). Specific injunctions in the Qur&#8217;aan were revealed in order to eliminate all the false rites which had become rampant in the pre-Islamic period. All indecent and shameful acts were strictly banned in Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;There is to be no lewdness nor wrangles during Hajj.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions among poets in the exaltations of their forefathers and their tribesmen&#8217;s&#8217; achievements were all stopped. Instead, Allaah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And when you have completed your rites [of Hajj] then remember Allah as you remember your forefathers; nay with a more vigorous remembrance.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:200</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions in generosity were also prohibited. Of course, the feeding of the poor pilgrims was still encouraged as this was done in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) but Allaah commanded that the slaughtering of the animals which was done for this purpose should be done seeking the pleasure of Allaah rather than fame and the praise of the people. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So mention the name of Allaah over these animals when they are drawn up in lines. Then, when they are drawn on their sides [after the slaughter], eat thereof and feed the beggar who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:36</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the deplorable practice of spattering blood of the sacrificed animals on the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and hanging their flesh on alters, then Allaah clearly informed them that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is Taqwaa (piety) from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:37</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also put a stop to the practice of circling the Ka&#8217;ba in a state of nudity and the argument that the pagans put forward to justify this ritual was sharply rebutted in Allaah&#8217;s question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Say: Who has forbidden the adornment [i.e. clothes] given by Allaah which He has produced for His Slaves?&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:32</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another custom which was prohibited through the Qur&#8217;aan was that of setting off for Hajj without taking any provisions for the journey. In the pre-Islamic period, some people who claimed to be <strong>mutawakkiloon</strong> (those having complete trust in Allaah) would travel to perform Hajj begging food the whole journey. They considered this form of behaviour a sign of piety and an indication of how much faith they had in Allaah. However Allaah told mankind that to have sufficient provisions for the journey was one of the preconditions for making Hajj. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And take a provision [with you] for the journey, but the best provision is at-Taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, all the pre-Islamic practices, which were based in ignorance, were abolished and Hajj was once more made a model of piety, fear of Allaah, purity, simplicity and austerity. Now, when the pilgrims reached the Ka&#8217;ba, they no longer found the carnivals and the frolic and frivolity that had once occupied the minds of the pilgrims there before. Now, there was the remembrance of Allaah at every step and every action and every sacrifice was devoted to Him alone. It was this kind of Hajj that was worthy of the reward of paradise, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <em>&#8220;The reward for an accepted Hajj is nothing less than paradise.&#8221; </em>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah grant us all the ability to visit His House and perform the Hajj in the manner of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad that this breaks the fast:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Two women were once fasting during the lifetime of Allaah’s Messenger and they almost died of thirst. This was mentioned to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) but he turned away from (allowing) them (to break the fast). Then they were mentioned to him again, so he called for them and ordered them to vomit, i.e. throw up, what was in their stomachs. So they both vomited and filled up a bowl with puss, blood and pieces of flesh. Then the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: ‘These two fasted by refraining from what Allaah made lawful for them. but they broke their fast by doing what Allaah made unlawful for them. One of them sat with the other and they began to eat from the flesh of people.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What transpired with these two women in the presence of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from their vomiting vile and disgusting things – this was from the miracles that Allaah allowed to occur at the hand of His Messenger so that he could show the evil effects of backbiting to the people. Allaah says: “And do not backbite one another. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother?” [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth shows that backbiting breaks the fast. This is in the figurative sense, meaning it nullifies the reward of fasting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sulaiman Al-Rajhi’s life a rags to riches story</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saudi Arabia’s rags-to-riches billionaire <strong><span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-18l" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">Sulaiman Al-Rajhi</span></a></span> is also a world-renowned philanthropist.</strong> He is the founder of Al-Rajhi Bank, the largest Islamic bank in the world, and one of the largest companies in Saudi Arabia. As of 2011, his wealth was estimated by Forbes to be $7.7 billion, making him the 120th richest person in the world. His flagship SAAR Foundation is a leading charity organization in the Kingdom. The Al-Rajhi family is considered as one of the Kingdom’s wealthiest non-royals, and among the world’s leading philanthropists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi is a billionaire who <strong>chose last year to become a poor man at his own will without having any cash or real estates or stocks that he owned earlier.</strong> He became penniless after transferring all his assets among his children and set aside the rest for endowments. In recognition of his outstanding work to serve Islam, including his role in establishing the world’s largest Islamic bank and his regular contribution toward humanitarian efforts to fight poverty, Al-Rajhi was chosen for this year’s prestigious King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an interview with Muhammad Al-Harbi of Al-Eqtisadiah business daily, Al-Rajhi speaks about how he was able to succeed in convincing chiefs of the leading central banks in the world, <strong><span style="color:#002060;">including that of the Bank of England, nearly 30 years ago that interest is forbidden in both Islam and Christianity, </span><span style="color:#002060;">and that the Islamic banking is the most effective solution to activate Islamic financing in the world and make it a real boost to the global economy.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of Al-Rajhi is that of a man who made his fortunes from scratch, <strong>relying on grit and determination.</strong> Al-Rajhi threw away his huge wealth through two windows — distributed a major part of his inheritance among his children and transferred another portion to endowments, which are regarded as the largest endowment in the history of the Islamic world. He had to fight poverty and suffering during his childhood before <strong>becoming a billionaire through hard work and relentless efforts, and then leaving all his fortunes to become penniless again.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi is still very active and hardworking even in<strong> his 80s with youthful spirits</strong>. He begins his work daily <strong>after morning prayers and is active until Isha prayers before going to bed early.</strong> He is now fully concentrated on running the endowment project under his SAAR Foundation, and traveling various regions of the Kingdom managing activities related with it. He always carries a pocket diary containing his daily programs and activities and he is accustomed to stick on to the schedule he had prepared well in advance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi scored excellent performance results in almost all businesses in which he carved out a niche for himself. In addition to establishing the world’s largest Islamic bank, he founded the largest poultry farm in the Middle East.<strong> The credit of activating the organic farming experiment in the Kingdom mainly goes to him through launching a number of farming projects, including Al-Laith shrimp farming. He also established real estate and other investment projects.</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Excerpts</strong>:</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sheikh Suleiman, have you become a poor man again?<span id="more-4361"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes. Now I own only my dresses. I distributed my wealth among my children and set aside a portion for endowment to run charity projects. As far as I am concerned, this situation was not a strange one. My financial condition reached zero point two times in my life, and therefore I have had the feeling and understanding (about poverty) well. <strong><span style="color:#002060;">But now the feeling is accompanied by happiness, relaxation and the peace of mind. </span><span style="color:#7030a0;">The zero phase in life this time is purely because of my own decision and choice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Why did you choose this path?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">All wealth belongs to Allah, and we are only those who are entrusted (by God) to take care of them</span></strong>. There were several reasons that prompted me to distribute the wealth and that resulted in performing this virtue. Most important among them is to <strong><span style="color:#002060;">foster brotherhood and love among my children and safeguard their harmonious relationship. This is more significant than any wealth in this life</span>. </strong>I was also keen not to be instrumental in wasting the precious time of courts in case of any differences of opinion among them with regard to partition of inheritance. There are several examples that everybody could see when children entered in dispute over wealth and that led to the collapse of companies. Nation has lost many large companies and their wealth that we could have been saved if we tackled the matter in a right manner. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Apart from this, every Muslim should work on some endowments that could benefit him in the life after death. Likewise, I prefer my children to work on developing wealth, which they inherit after my death, during my lifetime itself rather than I continue working to increase them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Are you getting enough free time after the distribution of wealth?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As earlier I am still working on developing endowments. I will donate and give alms from it until Allah takes over this trusted deposit. I have worked out a meticulous scheme for this endowment and developed it with the support of specialist consultants and agencies. This idea struck me long before. Usually people in the Islamic world set aside one-third <strong><span style="color:#002060;">or one-fourth of their wealth for endowment and that will be effective only after their death. But in my case, I decided to implement this decision in my lifetime itself.</span></strong> So I invited my children to Makkah during the end of Ramadan and presented the idea in front of them. They readily agreed it and then I distributed my wealth among my children in addition to setting aside a part of it for endowment. I sought the help of consultants to facilitate the procedures for <strong><span style="color:#002060;">the distribution of all my assets including properties, real estates and stocks, and that was completed in a cordial atmosphere. All my children are now fully satisfied with my initiative and they are now working on these properties in my lifetime.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>How much wealth you distributed among children and set aside for endowment?</strong></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He laughed without giving an answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How do you feel now about your projects?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to point out that there were some factors that prompted me to make investments in certain specific areas. My experiment in money exchange was the temptation to set up a bank. The absence of any Islamic banking was also another factor in establishing Al-Rajhi Bank, which is now the world&#8217;s biggest Islamic lender by market value. <strong>I began the experiment with opening an office in Britain where we introduced <span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-18l" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">Islamic banking system </span></a></span></strong>at a greater level. The experiment was a success and it had received total backing of the <strong>Saudi Islamic scholars at that time.</strong> I still recall the application made for getting license for the bank was turned down in the beginning. This was because the concerned British officials did not have any idea about Islamic banking. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Therefore, I went to London and met with the manager of the Bank of England and two of his deputies. I told them that Muslims and Christians see interest as forbidden (haram), and the Muslim and Christian religious people are unwilling to make transactions with banks based on interest and instead prefer to keep their cash and other valuables in boxes at their homes. </span></strong>I tried to convince them that (if we establish Islamic banks) this money would be helpful to strengthen the world economy. These talks were helpful in convincing them and they agreed to open Islamic banks. <strong>Then I traveled widely throughout the world in the West and East, and met with the chiefs of central banks in various countries and explained to them about the salient features of the Islamic economy.</strong> We started working and achieved success through launching it in the Kingdom and implementing it in London. <strong><span style="color:#002060;">When I returned to the Kingdom from London, I met the late Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz and Sheikh Abdullah bin Humaid, and informed them about the plan saying: &#8216;We would reach, by the grace of Allah, the Islamic banking within a stipulated period of time.&#8217; They praised me for the initiative. </span></strong>We started aggressively implementing the project and that is in the form of Al-Rajhi Bank as you see now. Regarding <strong>Al-Watania Poultry,</strong> the idea of establishing such a venture struck me after my visit to a poultry project abroad. I saw that the way of slaughtering chicken was not proper. Then I decided to make investments in the field of poultry after <strong>considering it as a duty to my religion and nation.</strong> I started the project even though making investments in poultry involved high risks in those days. Now Al-Watania has become a mega Saudi project that is instrumental in achieving food security in many respects. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">The company enjoys a 40 percent market share in the Kingdom, and Al-Watania chickens are naturally fed and halal slaughtered in accordance with the Shariah principles.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What about your insistence on introducing organic farming through Al-Watania agricultural projects?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you see, <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">now I am 85 and still enjoy good health. </span></strong>If we pursue organic farming as<strong><span style="color:#7030a0;"> our healthy food style, </span></strong>we can bring down cost of treatment to a great extent. We made several experiments in the field of organic farming. Our numerous experiments met with setbacks in the beginning. This prompted many engineers and workers to reach a conclusion that it is impossible to have organic farming and profit together. In the beginning, they were firm in their view that this would not at all be successful. But I insisted that it would work and continued compelling them to proceed with the venture. At one time, I took a firm position and told them<strong><span style="color:#002060;"> either to do organic farming or quit.</span></strong> Now we are reaping the fruits of this lucrative business in line with my vision to provide only the <strong><span style="color:#002060;">healthiest, safest and most trustworthy food to consumers. Al-Watania Agricultural Company stopped using chemicals and artificial fertilizers and focused exclusively on organic methods such as the use of pest insect repellants and animal manure.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Your austerity and thriftiness on spending are well known. Please comment?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am not a miser. But I am always vigilant against extravagance. I always try to impart this lesson to all those working with me whether it is in banking or poultry or other projects, and I am more concerned about it when it is coming to the case of my children. <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">In the past, I never gave money to my children when they were young in return for nothing. When any one of them approached me to give them cash, I asked them to do some work in exchange for it. In our life, we practice some extravagance without being aware of it. </span></strong>But it affects our whole life, exhausting us and putting a burden on our country. For example, there is no logic in putting heavy curtain on our windows and then lighting lamps in daytime when we get sunlight free of cost while electric lamps are costly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Despite all your wealth, why don&#8217;t you still have a private aircraft?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let me tell you that I have many planes but they belong to various airlines. I have ownership in all of them to the tune of the ticket fare that I pay for each travel. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">I always travel in economy class with the conviction that Allah bestowed us wealth not for showing arrogance or spend extravagantly but to deal with wealth as a trusted property.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What about the recreation and hobbies of Sheikh Al-Rajhi? How do you spend free time?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have not any special recreations. However, I find happiness and enjoyment while making a trip to the desert. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">I never went out of the Kingdom on a tourism trip.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What about your will? What are its salient features?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding my will related with wealth, I have already implemented it in my lifetime. As for the remaining aspect of my will, it is a public matter and also involves certain private matters, <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">besides encouraging my children to maintain their kinship and always reminding them about the life after death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How do you see your children&#8217;s private investments? Are there any directives to them?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of them are doing an excellent work in accordance with their knowledge and experience. Most often, I try to guide them when I noticed anything undesirable even if it is in their private investments. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Regarding my younger children, I always guide them, especially in the case of their investments</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">This is purely out of my keenness that they should be honest in their work as well as in spending wealth given by God as a trusted property.</span></strong> I am also eager to hear about my children that they are interacting with the society in the best possible manner, <strong><span style="color:#002060;">and that they are serving their religion and nation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In what way you like to spend your time? What are the places that you like most?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to travel between Riyadh, Qassim, Al-Jouf, and Al-Laith to oversee my projects there. I always prefer to visit the farms in Qassim and Al-Jouf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How could you preserve many old and precious things and antiques at Suleiman Al-Rajhi Museum?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A long time ago when I was in Jeddah, I was keen on preserving heritage pieces and gathered them together, especially those related with money exchange. There would be a history with every human being. The museum tells the story of money exchange. I particularly kept registers and cash boxes that were used when I started the money exchange business. The first cash box was made of wood, and there was a huge treasure box in which we kept our gold and silver. The artifacts kept at the museum tells the evolution of currency in the Kingdom through issuance of bank notes, as well as some currencies and coins that were in circulation among the Haj pilgrims. A major factor that prompted me to set up the museum was the visits made by a large number of officials from various countries to know more about these old coins and currencies. We have had to exhibit these rare collections in front of them to explain about our history and heritage, especially those related with money. I was keen to furnish the museum with historic and heritage pieces, especially with the same materials used for construction in the past. Hence, the roof of the museum was made of palm branches, and that was the case with the seating arrangements at the museum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Rajhi&#8217;s punctuality</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The interview also sheds light on many qualities of Al-Rajhi, including his punctuality. &#8220;In the beginning of my business career, I had appointments with several top European company executives and officials. I still remember that I reached late for such an appointment due to an unavoidable reason. My delay was only a few minutes but the official excused himself for the interview. Later, after expansion of the projects, the same official came late for an interview with me so I excused myself for the interview. I always carry a paper to note down the schedule of meetings and stick to the schedule at any cost.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#7030a0;">Al-Rajhi continued: I am always keen to strictly adhere to the Islamic principles throughout my life. </span></strong>Once I received an invitation from an Arab government to attend an investment conference there. On the sidelines of the conference, I was invited to take part in a dinner reception. When I reached there, I found a recreational program, which is contrary to our religious customs and traditions, taking place. <strong>So I quit the place immediately and, Abdul Aziz Al-Ghorair from the UAE also joined me.<span style="color:#002060;"> Soon minister plenipotentiary rushed to us, and we explained to him that the function is against our Islamic tradition. So he informed us that the recreational party would be cancelled. When they canceled that party, we participated in the dinner.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tackling crises</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Rajhi said: There was a huge fire that gutted down one of my factories managed by my son. When he came to inform me about it, I told him: Say praise be to God. I asked him not to submit any report about the losses to the authorities seeking compensation. <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">In fact, the compensation is from Allah and it is essential for us to be satisfied with What Allah destined for us.</span></strong> Assam Al-Hodaithy, financial director of Al-Watania Poultry, said: &#8220;When the fire broke out at the factory, we decided not to hurt Sheikh Al-Rajhi by informing about it at that moment. Later, when we met him next morning, he told us to shift the factory to another place and remove the debris until completion of reconstruction.&#8221; There was a similar fire at Al-Watania Poultry project in Egypt. The company incurred losses worth SR 10 million Egyptian pounds. When the concerned factory official contacted Al-Rajhi to inform about the fire, he was surprised to hear an instant reply from him: <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;AlHamdulillah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (Rahimahullah) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that in Egypt, there was a man who would maintain the mosques, making the call to prayer, etc. He was, by all outward means, an obedient person and devout worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, as he usually would, he ascended the minaret to make the call to prayer. At the base of the minaret, there was a Christian woman standing. He saw her, and was seduced by her looks. So, he descended the minaret, went to her, and entered her home. She said to him: “Who are you, and what do you want?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: “I want you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “You have enslaved my eyes, and you have captured my heart.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “I will never answer your desire in a doubtful or suspicious manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Ok, so, I will marry you, then.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “You are a Muslim, and I am a Christian. My father will never allow me to marry you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “So, I will become a Christian.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “If you wish to do so, go ahead.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the man became a Christian in order to marry this woman, and lived with the woman’s family in her house. Later on that day, however, he was on the roof of the house. He fell from the roof and died without even having enjoyed his new bride. So, he lost the woman, and he lost his religion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Story of a man who succumbed to Temptation</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Inspirational Read !!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that a group of people were once seated in the company of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, when some men passed by, dragging along with them a body of a dead man. When Al-Hasan saw the dead man, a glint of instant recognition could be discerned in his eyes, and he fell unconscious from the shock of some memory that had just been rekindled. When he regained consciousness, his companions asked him what was wrong with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: This man – referring to the dead man being dragged along on the ground – used to be one of the best worshipers and one of the most renowned ascetics (in the world) (renouncing all the temporary pleasures of this world because he was so busy and devoted to worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day he left his home, intending to go to the Masjid to pray, but on the way, he saw a beautiful young Christian women, who became an immediate temptation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he proposed to her, she refused, saying; “I will not marry you until you become an adherent of my religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on his way, but as time went on, he yearned for her continued to increase. He then succumbed to her wish and exited from the fold of (Islaam) the religion of pure, unadulterated Monotheism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After he became a Christian and some time passed, the woman came out to him from behind the curtain and said, “You are a man who is bereft of goodness. You have forsaken your religion, which was important to you for your entire life, simply for the sake of a lust that is of no value. Indeed, I too am forsaking my religion, but not for the same reason. I am doing so in order to achieve a blissful existence that never comes to an end, an eternal existence under the care of the One, the As-Samad (i.e., Allaah; The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creature need, He neither eats nor drinks).” She then recited the entire Chapter of Al-Ikhlaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad (saw): “He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.</span>” [Qur&#8217;aan:112:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people had heard about what she had said, they approached her and asked, “All along, you had this Chapter memorized?“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No,” she answered. “By Allaah, I had never known it before. But after this man continued to insist upon having me, I saw a dream; I saw Hellfire, and my place in it was shown to me. I became terrified and panic-stricken. Maalik – the custodian of the Hellfire – said to me: ‘Do not be afraid or sad, for Allaah has ransomed (i.e., saved) you with this man (i.e., he will take the place in Hellfire that you would have taken had not Allaah saved you).’ He then took me by the hand and admitted me into Paradise. Seeing a line written inside of it, I read it; among what was written were these Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfooz).”</span> {Qur’aan 13:39]}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited the Al-Ikhlas Chapter to me, and I began to repeat it. Then I woke up and had it (the Al-Ikhlas Chapter) memorized.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan then said, “The woman then embraced Islaam, and the man whose corpse you just saw being dragged away was killed for having apostatized. And I ask Allaah to make us firm and steadfast upon guidance and to grant us safety and success.”¹</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">[Translated by <strong>Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Posted by <strong>Saad Burbank</strong> @ <a href="http://alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-story-of-how-an-najjaashee-became-the-king-of-abyssinia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Concerning an-Najjaashee&#8217;s refusal to surrender the Muslims in his land to the Mushrikoon from Quraish, and his refusal to accept gifts to bribe him to do that:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* az-Zuhree said: &#8220;I had this hadeeth narrated by &#8220;Urwah ibn az-Zubayr (rahimahullaah): from Umm Salamah (radiyallaahu &#8220;anhaa). So &#8220;Urwah said: &#8220;Do you know what he (i.e. an-Najjaashee) meant by his saying: &#8220;Allaah did not take any bribe from me, when He restored my kingdom to me, such that I should accept any bribe to keep my kingdom; And Allaah did not do what the people wanted with regard to me, such that I should obey the people against Him.&#8221; ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said; &#8220;No.&#8221;&#8230; So then &#8220;Urwah explained it, saying:  &#8220;Aa&#8217;ishah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhaa) narrated to me that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">&lt;&lt; His father was previously king of his people, and he had a brother, and his brother had twelve sons. But the father of an-Najjaashee had no child besides an-Najjaashee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So the people of Abyssinia started plotting together and they said: We ought to kill the father of an-Najjaashee, and give the kingship to his brother, then his brother has twelve sons. So then later they can inherit the kingship and the Abyssinian people will remain for a long time without any infighting between them. So they attacked (the king) and killed him, and they made his brother king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So then an-Najjaashee entered upon his uncle, and he impressed him so much that he consulted nobody else besides him, and he was found to be a person of intellect and firm resolve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So when the rest of the Abyssinians saw the status which he now had with his uncle they said: This boy has got the better of his uncle now, so we do not feel safe that he will not make him king over us (after himself), and he knows that we have killed his father. So if that happens, he will not leave a single noble amongst us except he will kill him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So they went to his uncle and said: You know that we killed his father, and put you in his place; and we do not feel safe that he will not become king over us (after you). So either you kill him, or you banish him from our land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">He said, &#8220;Woe to you, you killed his father yesterday, and now I have to kill him today! Rather I will send him away from your land.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So they took him away, and put him in the market place; and they sold him as a slave to a trader from the traders who threw him into a ship, having bought him for 600 or 700 dirhams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Then he departed with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Then when it was the evening of that same day some clouds from the autumn clouds appeared. So his uncle went out to enjoy the rain, but he was struck by a lightening bolt which killed him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So the people quickly went to his children, but they found that they were stupid people. There was not a single one that had any good in him. So the affair of the Abyssinians was thrown into confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So some of them said to others:</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> &#8220;You know, by Allaah, that the only one who is suitable to be king over you is the one who you sold this morning. So if you have any concern for the affair of the Abyssinians, then go and get him before he leaves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So they went searching for him. So they found him and they brought him back; and they placed the crown upon his head, and they sat him upon his throne, and they made him the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">But the trader (came and) said: &#8220;Give me back my money, for you have taken my slave!&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They said: &#8220;We will not give you anything.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> So the trader said, &#8220;Then by Allaah, I will go and speak to him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So he went to him and spoke to him, and said: &#8220;O king! I bought a slave and the people who sold him to me took the price, but then they seized the slave and took him away from me, and they won&#8221;t give me my money back.&#8221; So this was the first case that was seen from the firmness, wisdom, and justice of an- Najjaashee that he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;You must either give him his money back; or hand over his slave to him so that he may take him wherever he wants.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> So the people said: &#8220;Rather we will give him his money.&#8221; So they gave it to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So this is why ((when the Najjaashee did not surrender the Muslims, and did not accept the bribe from the Quraish to hand over the Muslims)), he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Allaah did not take any bribe from me, when He restored my kingdom to me, such that I should take any bribe to keep my kingdom; And Allaah did not do what the people wanted with regard to me, such that I should obey the people against Him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* <strong>Shaikh al- Albaanee</strong> mentioned that it is reported by Ibn Hishaam in his abridgement of Ibn Ishaaq&#8221;s &#8220;Seerah&#8221; (1/363-364), and by Aboo Nu&#8221;aym in &#8220;ad-Dalaa.il&#8221; (pp.81- 84), and that its chain of narration is &#8220;hasan&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* &#8211; This is the same one, an- Najjaashee, who sent a message to the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8220;alaihi-wa sallam) to say that he had accepted Islaam; and he died upon Islaam (radiyallaahu &#8220;anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then Ibn Ishaaq reports through his chain of narration from &#8220;Aa.ishah that when an- Najjaashee died that the people mentioned that light was continually seen over his grave. Shaikh al-Albaanee said its chain is hasan (good).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; He is the one who is mentioned in al-Bukhaaree and Muslim in a hadeeth of Aboo Hurairah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) that when he died, the Prophet (sal Allaahu alaihi wa sallam) was told through Revelation, and that he ordered the Companions to form rows and he prayed the Funeral Prayer for him, as no one in his land prayed the Funeral Prayer for him.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shytan has power over the believers due to their sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hadith states, &#8220;Allah is with the judge as long as he does not commit any injustice. If he commits any injustice, Allah is free from him and keeps Shytan with him.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Jauzi</strong> [2] has related a unique story from <strong>al-Hassan al-Basri</strong> (rahimahullah). The story, depending on how authentic it is, shows the ability of a human in overpowering Shytan if he is sincere to Allah in his religion and it shows how Shytan can take advantage of the human when he strays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri narrated that there was a tree that was worshipped instead of Allah. One man decided to chop down that tree. He was going to chop down the tree out of anger for the sake of Allah. On the way to the tree he met Iblees who was in the form of a man. Iblees asked him, &#8220;What do you plan on doing?&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;I am going to chop down that tree that is worshipped instead of Allah.&#8221; Shytan said, &#8220;If you do not worship it, why should it harm you if others do so?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I will chop it down.&#8221; Shytan then told him, &#8220;Would you like something better than that&#8221; Do not cut it and you will get two dinars every morning under your pillow.&#8221; &#8220;From where will I get that?&#8221; the man asked. &#8220;I will give it to you,&#8221; said Iblees. The man returned and the next morning he found two dinars under his pillow. The following morning he again found two dinars under his pillow. On the following morning he did not find anything. He got upset and went to chop down the tree. Shytan again appeared to him in the shape of the same man. Shytan asked him, &#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;I plan on cutting down that tree that is worshipped instead of Allah!&#8221; Iblees said, &#8220;You have lied. There is no way you will be able to do it,&#8221; The man left to chop it down. The earth swallowed him and him until it almost killed him. Iblees asked, &#8220;Do you know who I . I am Shytan. I met you for the first time when you were angry for the sake of Allah and I had no power over you. I deceived you by two dinars and you stopped what you had intended to do [for the sake of Allah]. Now you have come because you are angry about the two dinars, and I have gotten mastery over you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[1] This was recorded by al-Haakim and al-Baihaqi with a hasan chain. See al- Albanee Sahih al-Jaami, vol. 2, p.130</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A View through Hijab &#8211; By Sister Khaula From Japan 10/25/1993 [57]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A view through Hijaab&#8221; is an informative account of life in Hijaab. Written by Khaula Nakata, it is the experience of Hijaab as seen through the eyes of a Japanese woman who embraced Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>My Story To Islam :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As most of the Japanese, I&#8217;d followed no religion before I embraced Islam in France. I was majoring in French Literature at the university. My favorite thinkers were Sartre, Nietchze and Camas, whose thinking is atheistic. At the same time, however, I was very interested in religion, not because of my inner necessity but of my love for the truth. What was waiting for me after death did not interest me at all; how to live was my concern(58). For a long time I had a sort of impression that I was not doing what I should do and I was wasting my time. Whether God existed or not was the same to me; I just wanted to know the truth and choose my way of life-to live with God or without God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I started to read books on different religions except Islam. I had never thought that Islam was a religion worth studying. It was for me, at that time, a sort of primitive idolatry of the simple mind (how ignorant I was!). I made friends with Christians, with whom I studied the Bible, to come to realize a few years later the existence of God. But then I had to face a dilemma because I could not &#8220;feel&#8221; God at all, in spite of my conviction that he should exist. I tried to pray in church, but in vain. I felt nothing but the absence of God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then studied Buddhism, hoping I would be able to feel God through Zen or Yoga. I found as many things in Buddhism that seemed to be true as I had in Christianity, yet there were many things I could not understand or accept. In my opinion, If God exists, He should be for everyone(59) and the truth should simple and clear to everyone. I could not understand why people should abandon ordinary life to devote themselves to God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was really at a loss for what to do to reach the end of my desperate quest for God. It was then that I met an Algerian Muslim. Born and raised in France, he didn&#8217;t even know how to pray and his life was quite far from the ideal of a Muslim; nevertheless, he had very strong faith in God. However, his belief without knowledge irritated me and made me decide to study Islam. To start with, I bought a French translation of the Qur&#8217;an, but I could not read more than two pages. It seemed so strange and boring. I gave up my effort to understand it alone and went to the mosque in Paris to ask someone to help me. It was a Sunday and there was a lecture for women. The sisters welcomed me warmly. It was my first encounter with practicing Muslim women. To my surprise, I felt myself very much at ease with them, although I&#8217;d always felt myself a stranger in the company of Christians. I started to attend the lecture every weekend and to read a book given to me by one of the Muslim women. Every minute of the lecture and every page of the book were, for me, a revelation, giving me great spiritual satisfaction I&#8217;ve never known before. I had an excited feeling that I was being initiated into the truth. What was wonderful, Subhaanallah (Praise be to Allaah), was my feeling the presence of God very close to me while in the posture of Sajdah (prostration).<br />
__________<br />
(57) Sister Khaula visited the Women&#8217;s Office of The Islamic Guidance Center in Buraidah, Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia on 10/25/1993. She shared this information with other Muslim Sisters in the Office. 1 found it important to share with our Muslim brothers and sisters the Story of Khaula&#8217;s coming to Islam followed by her experience and advice concerning the Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(58) This is the concern of so many people in the World and especially in the West or in countries dominated by Western culture. People become &#8220;workaholic&#8221; to keep up with more and more of what they want to have. The secondary things of today are the necessities of tomorrow! The Medium way described by the Creator, Allah, is ignored except by the few.(Dr.S. As-Saleh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(59) Allah is the God of everyone. This thought translates that God must be one. There is no nationalistic belonging to God! Being the God of everyone, He does not command some people to worship Him alone while at the same time makes it permissible for others to set up rivals with Him in worship. This means that His worship must be one and that it is not up to us to define this type of worship. The way of worship belongs to the One and Only One True God, Allah. This constitutes His religion and He had named this way: Islam.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Khula&#8217;s Story with the Hijab :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Two years ago when I embraced Islam in France, the polemic around the wearing of the hijab at school was very hot. The majority of people thought it was against the principle of the public school which should keep its neutrality towards the religion. I, who was not yet Muslim then, could hardly understand why they were worried over such a tiny thing as a small scarf put on the head of Muslim students&#8230;but, apparently, French people who had faced the serious problem of the increasing non-employment rate and the insecurity in big cities became nervous over the immigration of workers from Arab countries. They felt aggrieved by the sight of the hijab in their town and in their school.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Arab countries, on the other hand, a great wave of coming back of the hijab was being observed especially among the young generation, against the expectation, shared by some Arab people and the most of Western people, of its passing away from the scene as Westenerization took root.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic revival symbolized by the current resurgence of the hijab is often considered as an attempt of Arab Muslims to restore their pride and identity which have been repeatedly undermined by colonization and economic retardation. For Japanese people, the actual adherence of Arab people to Islam may seem a kind of conservative traditionalism or antiwesternism, which (the) Japanese knew themselves in the Meiji era at the first contact with the Western culture, and because of which they reacted against the Western life-style and the Western way of dressing. Man has always had a conservative tendency and reacts against which is new and unfamiliar without realizing whether it is good or bad for him. Some people still think the Muslim women insist on wearing hijab which is the &#8220;very symbol of the oppressed situation because they are enslaved by the tradition and are not sufficiently aware of their lamentable situation. If only, they probably think, the movement of the women&#8217;s liberation and independence awakes those women&#8217;s mind, they will take away the hijab.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a naive point of view is shared by the people who have little knowledge of Islam. They, who are so accustomed to the secularism and the religious eclecticism, are simply unable to understand that the teaching of Islam is universal and eternal. Anyway, there are more and more women, beyond the Arab Nationality, all over the world embracing Islam as the true religion and covering the hair. I am but an example of these women. The hijab is surely a strange object for non-Muslim people. For them, the Hijab does not cover the woman&#8217;s hair but also hides something to which they have no access, and it&#8217;s why they feel uneasy. From the outside, effectively, they can never see what is behind the Hijab. I have kept the hijab since I became Muslim in Paris two years ago&#8230;In France, soon after my conversion, I put a scarf, matched in color to the dress, lightly on the head, which people might think a sort of fashion(60). Now in Saudi Arabia, I cover in black all my body from the top of my head till the tip of my toes including my eyes&#8230;At the time I decided to embrace Islam, I did not think seriously about whether I would be able to make the five prayers a day or put the hijab. May be I was afraid that I might find the negative answer, and that would affect my decisions to be Muslim. I had lived in a world which had nothing to do with Islam until I visited, for the first time, the Mosque of Paris. Neither the prayer nor the hijab were yet very familiar to me. I could hardly imagine myself making the prayer and wearing the hijab. But my desire to be a Muslim was too strong to worry about what was waiting for me after my conversion. Indeed, it was a miracle that I embraced Islam, Allah Akbar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In hijab I felt myself different. I felt myself purified and protected. I felt the company of Allah. As a foreigner, I felt sometimes uneasy in a public place, stared by men. With hijab, I was not seen. I found that the hijab sheltered me from such impolite stares. I was also very happy and proud in hijab which is not only the sign of my obedience to Allah but also the manifestation of my faith&#8230;besides, the hijab helps us to recognize each other and to share the feeling of sisterhoods. The hijab has also the advantage of reminding the people around me that God exists and reminding me of being with God(61). It tells me: &#8220;be careful. You should conduct yourself as a Muslim&#8221; As a policeman becomes more conscious of his profession in his uniform, I had a stronger feeling of being Muslim with hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soon, I started to put the hijab before my going out from the house whenever I went to the Mosque. It was a spontaneous and voluntary act and no body forced me to do so. Two weeks after my conversion, I went back to Japan to attend the wedding ceremony of one of my sisters, and decided not to go back to France, Now that I became a Muslim and found that I&#8217;d been looking for, the French literature did not interest me any more. I had rather an increasing passion for learning the Arabic(62).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For me&#8230;it was a trial to live in a small town in Japan, isolated completely from Muslims, But such isolation helped me to intensify my consciousness of being a Muslim. As Islam prohibits the women to disclose the body and to wear clothes which accentuate the body line, I had to abandon many of my clothes such as mini-skirts and half-sleeve blouses. Besides, the Western style fashion does not match with the hijab. I decided, therefore, to make a dress by myself. I asked a friend of mine who knew dress-making to help me, and in two weeks I made a dress with a &#8220;pantaloon&#8221; after the model of a &#8220;Pakistani dress&#8221;. I did not mind people looking at my strange &#8220;fashion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Six months had past since I went back to Japan, when my desire to study the Arabic and Islam in a Muslim country grew so intense that I decided to realize it. I went to Cairo where I knew only one person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was at a loss to find none of my host family spoke English. To my great surprise, furthermore, the lady who took my hand to lead me into the house covered herself all in black from top to toe including the face. Such a &#8220;fashion&#8221; is now familiar to me and I adopt it for myself in Riyadh, but at that time, I was quite surprised at the sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attended once in France a big conference for Muslims, and in that occasion I saw for the first time a woman in black dress with a face-cover. Her presence among the women in colorful dress and scarf was very strange and I said myself: &#8221; there she is, a woman enslaved by the Arabic tradition without knowing the real teaching of Islam&#8221;, because I knew few things of Islam at that time and thought the covering of the face was but an ethnical tradition not founded in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thought which came to me at the sight of a face-covered woman in Cairo was not very far from that. She&#8217;s exaggerating. Its unnatural&#8230;Her attempts to try to avoid any contact with men seemed also abnormal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sister in black dress told me that my self-made dress was not suitable to go out with. I was not content with her because I thought my dress satisfied the conditions of a Muslima&#8217;s dress&#8230;I bought a black cloth and made a long dress and a long veil called &#8220;Khimar&#8221; which covers the loins and the whole of the arms. I was even ready to cover the face because it seemed good &#8220;to avoid the dust&#8221;, but the sister said there was no need. I should not put the cover-face for such a reason while these sisters put it because they believed it a religious duty. Although most of sisters whom I got acquainted with covered the face, they constituted but a small minority in the whole city of Cairo, and some people apparently got shocked and embarrassed at the sight of black Khimar. Indeed the ordinary more or less westernized young Egyptians tried to keep a distance from those women in Khimar, calling them &#8220;the sisters&#8221;. The men also treated them with a certain respect and a special politeness on the street or in a bus. Those women shared a sisterhood and exchanged the salaam (the Islamic greeting) on the street even without knowing each other… Before my conversion I preferred an active pants-style to a feminine skirt, but the long dress I started to wear in Cairo got to please me very soon. It makes me feel very elegant as if I had become a princess. I feel more relaxed in long dress than in a pantaloon …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My sisters were really beautiful and bright in their Khimar, and a kind of saintliness appeared on their faces&#8230;Every Muslim devotes his life to God. I wonder why people who say nothing about the &#8220;veil&#8221; of the &#8220;Catholic Sisters&#8221; criticize the veil of the Muslima, considering it as a symbol of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; or &#8220;oppression&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave a negative answer when the Egyptian sister told me to wear like this even after my return to Japan….If I show myself in such a long black dress on the street in Japan, people might think me crazy(63). Shocked by my dress, they would not like to listen to me, whatever I say. they would reject Islam because of my appearance, without trying to know its teaching(64). Thus I argued with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sixth months later, however, I got accustomed to my long dress and started to think I may wear it even in Japan. So, just before my return to Japan, I made some dresses with light colors and white Khimars, thinking they would be less shocking than the black one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reaction of the Japanese to my white Khimar was rather good and I met no rejection or mockery at all. They seemed to be able to guess my belonging to a religion without knowing which it is. I heard a young girl behind me whispering to her friend that I was a &#8220;Buddhist nun&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once on a train I sat beside an elderly man who asked me why I was in such a &#8220;strange fashion&#8221;. I explained him that I was a Muslim and in Islam women are commanded to cover the body and their charm so as not to trouble men who are weak to resist this kind of temptation. He seemed very impressed by my explanation, may be because he did not welcome today&#8217;s young girls&#8217; provocative fashion. He left the train thanking me and saying he would have liked to have more time to talk with me on Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father was sorry that I went out even on the hottest day in summer with a long sleeve and a head-cover, but I found the hijab convenient for avoiding the direct sunlight on the head and the neck&#8230; I felt rather uneasy in looking at the white thigh of my younger sister who wore short pants. I&#8217;ve often been embarrassed even before my conversion by the sight of a woman&#8217;s busts and hips traced by the shape of her tight thin clothes. I felt as if I had seen something not to be seen. If such a sight embraces me who is of the same sex, it is not difficult to imagine what effect it would give to men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why hide the body in its natural state?, you may ask. But think it was considered vulgar fifty years ago in Japan to swim in a swimming suit. Now we swim in a bikini without shame. If you swim, however, with a topless, people would say you are shameless, but go to a South-France&#8217;s beach, where many women, young and old, take a sun-bath in a topless. If you go to a certain beach on the west coast in America, the nudists take a sun-bath as naked as when they are born. On the other side, at the medieval times, a knight trembled at a brief sight of a shoe of his adoring lady. It shows the definition of women&#8217;s &#8220;secret part&#8221; can be changed. How you can answer to a nudist if she asks you why you hide yours busts and hips although they are as natural as your hands and face? It is the same for the hijab of a Muslima. We consider all our body except hands and face as private parts because Allah defined it like this(65). Its why we hide them from male strangers. If you keep something secret, it increases in value. Keeping woman&#8217;s body secret increases its charm. Even for the eye of the same sex, the nape of a sister&#8217;s neck is surprisingly beautiful because it is normally covered. If a man loses the feeling of shame and starts to walk naked and excrete and &#8220;make love&#8221; in the presence of other people, he would then become no different than an animal. I think the culture of men started when men knew the sense of shame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Japanese wives (put their) make up only when they go out, never minding at home how they look. But in Islam a wife tries to be beautiful especially for her husband and a husband also tries to have a nice look to please his wife. They have shame even between themselves and towards each other. You may say why we are &#8220;over-sensitive&#8221; to hide the body except the face and the hands so as not to excite men&#8217;s desire, as if a man looks always at a woman with a sexual appetite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the problem of sexual harassment so much talked about recently shows how men are weak to resist to this kind of attraction. We could not expect prevention of sex harassment only by appealing men&#8217;s high morality and self-control&#8230;As a short skirt might be interpreted by men to say: &#8221; if you want me, you may take me&#8221;, a hijab means clearly, &#8220;I am forbidden for you. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three months after coming back from Cairo, I left Japan to Saudi Arabia, and this time with my husband. I had prepared a small black cloth to cover the face with&#8230;Arriving at Riyadh, I found out that not all the women covered the face. The non- Muslim foreigners of course put only a black gown nonchalantly without covering the head, but the Muslim foreigners also uncovered the face(66). As for the Saudi women, all of them seemed to cover perfectly from top to toe. On my first going out, I put the niqab and found out (that) it (was) quite nice. Once accustomed to it, there is no inconvenience. Rather, I felt quite fine as if I became a noble and special person. I felt like the owner of a stolen masterpiece who enjoyed the secret pleasure: I have a treasure that you don&#8217;t know and which you are not allowed to see. A foreigner might see a couple of a fat man and a woman all covered in black who follows him in the street in Riyadh as a caricature of the oppressing-oppressed relationship or the possessing-possessed relationship, but the fact is that the women feel as if they were queens guarded and lead by servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the first several months in Riyadh, I covered only the part beneath the eyes. But when I made a winter cloth, I made on the same occasion a thin eye-cover. My armament then became perfect and my comfort also. Even in a crowd of men, I felt no more uneasiness. I felt as if I had become transparent before the eyes of men. When I displayed the eyes, I felt sometines uneasy when my eyes met a man&#8217;s eye accidentally, especially because the Arab people have very keen eyes. The eye-cover prevents, like black sun-glasses, the visual intrusion of strangers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaula further says that the Muslim woman &#8220;covers herself for her own dignity. She refuses to be possessed by the eyes of a stranger and to be his object. She feels pity for western women who display their private parts as objects f or male strangers. If one observes the hijab from outside, one will never see what is hidden in it. Observing the hijab from the outside and living it from inside are two completely different things. We see different things. This gap explains the gap of understanding Islam. From the outside, Islam looks like a &#8216;prison&#8217; without any liberty. But living inside of it, we feel at peace and freedom and joy that we&#8217;ve never known before&#8230;We chose Islam against the so-called freedom and pleasure. If it is true that Islam is a religion that oppresses the women, why are there so many young women in Europe, in America, and in Japan who abandon their liberty and independence to embrace Islam? I want people to reflect on it. A person blinded because of his prejudice may not see it, but a woman with the hijab is so brightly beautiful as an angel or a saint with self-confidence, calmness, and dignity. Not a slight touch of shade nor trace of oppression is on her face. &#8216;They are blind and cannot see&#8217;, says the Qur&#8217;an about those who deny the sign of Allah, but by what else can we explain this gap on the understanding of Islam between us and those people.&#8221; (3/1993)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Today many realize that all of the materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to social, economical, political and psychological problems. That is why people who used to say: &#8220;let us live this life and enjoy it.&#8221; or &#8220;hey! We don&#8217;t want to know about God&#8221;, are in search again</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture of Shaykh Falaah Ismaeel (حفظه الله) was recorded on Tuesday, February 08, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture the Shaykh covered everything in regards with following the Salaf. He mentioned that we should follow the Salaf in their Aqeedah (creed), Ibadaat (acts of worship), Ikhlaaq (good manners), Mua’mulaat, and in everything. He mentioned many stories and one of the stories was about one of the Student of Knowledge (حفظه الله).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said &#8211; &#8220;I met one Student of Knowledge about 30 years ago when he was studying in Madinah (Saudi Arabia). We used to live together and sit with Ulemah. He was a very good student, he was excellent in the first year, excellent in the second, and in the third year but when the forth year started, he came to me and told me that he would like to go back to his home country (United Kingdom). Everybody asked him that why you want to leave, you are almost there, finish your education, get your degree, and then leave. He began to cry and said that he got a phone call from his family member and they told him that his father is very sick and he is in the hospital and the family is afraid that he may die (upon kufr). We told him that your father may not die, a lot of people go to the hospital but not everyone dies immediately. But he said that something in my heart telling me to leave. So he got on the plane and went back and didn’t finish the forth and last year of the University&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said that he didn’t care about the degree. He was truthful with Allah as related to guiding his father to Al-Islam and Allah was truthful with him as well. He went back and after a couple of days, we talked to him and he said alhamdulillah my father has accepted Islam. He said that alhamdulillah my father died upon Islam in the same hospital. The Shaykh said I visited him after many years and he said that now my mother is Muslim and my whole family is Muslim. <strong>The Shaykh said what we learn from this story that if you really care about your family and they are non Muslims, then focus your time and do what you can, the success is with Allah </strong><strong>(سبحانه وتعالى). </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful<br />
All Praise is due to Allaah, Lord of everything that exists</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:large;"><strong><span style="color:green;">The Importance of Being Truthful</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Falaah Isma&#8217;eel recently relayed a heart-melting story that may interest you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh visited Holland, he was of course met by Muslims from Holland and they told him, &#8220;If you had come two weeks earlier you would have seen it yourself. We prayed over this man.&#8221; Then they told him the following story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[What follows is not verbatim, but a summary, with some explanations so as to clarify some terms that may be new to non-Muslims.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a 26-year-old Christian from Holland. One day, he changed his dress to thobes, a burnoose, grew a beard, and the people started calling him &#8220;the one who looks like Jesus.&#8221;One day, he met some Muslims, and he said to them, &#8220;I love Jesus.&#8221; And the Muslims told him, &#8220;We also love Jesus, and it is even a condition of Islam. We love Jesus and Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this man tried imitating Jesus, helping others when he could, cutting their lawns and the like. After two years, he entered the mosque [the Muslims&#8217; place of worship] for the first time, and he was greeted with &#8220;ahlan&#8221; [which means welcome, and thus was not greeted with the greeting reserved for Muslims &#8220;as-salaamu &#8216;alaykum&#8221; (which means: may peace and safety be upon you on the Day of Judgement)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;no; I want to be a Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the Muslims witnessed his testimony (pronounced &#8220;shahada&#8221;) &#8211; there is none deserving of worship except Allaah, and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and Jesus is His servant and Messenger &#8211; taught him the basics, and taught him how to pray. He began praying in congregation with them, not missing a single congregation. Then one day, he noticed that the other Muslims were arriving at the mosque after him, so he asked for a key to the mosque. And he was given one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims then observed that not only was he opening the mosque, but additionally he was routinely found in optional prayer whenever they entered the mosque for the dawn prayer. [They would enter and find him already engaged in the worship of Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one day, he told the Muslims how he decided to become Muslim. He said he had a dream about Jesus (the son of Mary), and Jesus said to him, &#8220;Be Muslim. Be Muslim. Be Muslim.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I woke up, and a few days later, I had the same dream. This happened three times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The shaikh interjected and said, this is success from Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after having prayed for 20 days with the other Muslims, he died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the mercy of Allaah, and Allaah saved him [from dying upon other than Islam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Sidq (truthfulness); he truthfully loved Jesus, so he became Muslim. Allaah guided him to become Muslim, because he was truthful in his love for Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">If one is truthful in his love for Jesus and his following Jesus, then this should lead him to the true religion of Jesus (Islam) and should lead him to following whom Jesus commanded to be followed after him &#8211; Muhammad, the seal of all Prophets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">After all, the religion of all the Prophets was Islam, and their creed was the same, and their message was the same, and they confirmed each other.</span><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"> It is only the deviant who have distorted the message of the previous Prophets, and thus Allaah promised to preserve His last revelation (the Qur`an) from corruption.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-Fawaaid Ad-daraaree, Al-Ajloonee related that Imam Bukhaaree (may Allah have mercy on him) once travelled by boat on a journey to seek out knowledge and that  he had taken with him one-thousand dinars. One of his fellow travelers ingratiated himself with Imam Bukharee, outwadly showing him love and admiration. During the sea-voyage, the man often made it a point to sit in his company. On long journeys, friendships develop faster than normal, and during the course of the time they spent together, Imam Bukhaaree informed the man that he had one-thousand dinars with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The morning after Imam Bukharee spoke about the money, the man woke up and began to cry, scream, rip his clothing apart, and slap his own face, as if he had just been afflicted with a great loss. His fellow shipmates asked him what was wrong, and he refused to answer at first, as if he was still in a state of  shock and could not bring himself to speak about his situation. After they continually insisted that he tell them what the matter was with him, he finally said, &#8220;I had a bag that contained one-thousand dinars, and I lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The crewmen who were incharge of the ship began to search the passengers. One by one everyone was being searched, and upon realizing what was happening, Imam Bukharee, making sure that no one was looking, threw his bag of money over the side of the ship. When it was his turn to be searched, nothing was found. When the entire ship and all of its passengers were searched, and when no bag of money was found, those in authority on the ship went back to the man who had made up the story and chastised him for making a false claim and for putting them through so much trouble. As soon as the ship finally reached shore, the passengers began to disembark;meanwhile, Imam Bukhaaree&#8217;s old friend went to him and asked him what he had done with the bag of money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I threw it into the sea,&#8221; Imam Bukhaaree matter-of-factly replied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And you are patiently accepting the fact that you have just lost such a huge sum of money?&#8221; the man asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O ignorant one,&#8221; Imam Bukhaaree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Do you not know that I have spent my entire life gathering the Ahadeeth of the Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and that  the world now acknowledges my trustworthiness. Would it then have been befitting for me to subject  myself to the accusation of theft? And shall I lose the precious pearl (i.e my knowledge and achievements as a scholar) that I have earned over a lifetime over a limited number of dinars?&#8221;</span>[1]</p>

<p>[<strong>Taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong>] <span style="font-size:small;">&#8211;</span></p>
<p>A Summary of the Story of the People of the Elephant</p>
<p>This is the story of the people of the Elephant, in brief, and summarized. It has already been mentioned in the story of the People of the Ditch that Dhu Nuas, the last king of Himyar, a polytheist &#8212; was the one who ordered killing the People of the Ditch. They were Christians and their number was approximately twenty thousand. None of them except a man named Daws Dhu Tha`laban escaped. He fled to Ash-Sham where he sought protection from Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham, who was also a Christian. Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the king of Ethiopia (Abyssinia), who was closer to the home of the man. An-Najashi sent two governors with him: Aryat and Abrahah bin As-Sabah Abu Yaksum, along with a great army. The army entered Yemen and began searching the houses and looting in search of the king of Himyar (Dhu Nuwas). Dhu Nuwas was eventually killed by drowning in the sea. Thus, the Ethiopians were free to rule Yemen, with Aryat and Abrahah as its governors. However, they continually disagreed about matters, attacked each other, fought each other and warred against each other, until one of them said to the other, &#8220;There is no need for our two armies to fight. Instead let us fight each other (in a duel) and the one who kills the other will be the ruler of Yemen.&#8221; So the other accepted the challenge and they held a duel. Behind each man was a channel of water (to keep either from fleeing). Aryat gained the upper hand and struck Abrahah with his sword, splitting his nose and mouth, and slashing his face. But `Atawdah, Abrahah&#8217;s guard, attacked Aryat and killed him. Thus, Abrahah returned wounded to Yemen where he was treated for his injuries and recovered. He thus became the commander of the Abyssinian army in Yemen.</p>
<p>Then the king of Abyssinia, An-Najashi wrote to him, blaming him for what had happened (between him and Aryat) and threatened him, saying that he swore to tread on the soil of Yemen and cut off his forelock. Therefore, Abrahah sent a messenger with gifts and precious objects to An-Najashi to appease him and flatter him, and a sack containing soil from Yemen and a piece of hair cut from his forelock. He said in his letter to the king, &#8220;Let the king walk upon this soil and thus fulfill his oath, and this is my forelock hair that I send to you.&#8221; When An-Najashi received this, he was pleased with Abrahah and gave him his approval. Then Abrahah wrote to An-Najashi saying that he would build a church for him in Yemen the like of which had never been built before. Thus, he began to build a huge church in San`a&#8217;, tall and beautifully crafted and decorated on all sides. The Arabs called it Al-Qullays because of its great height, and because if one looked at it, his cap would be in danger of falling off as he tilted his head back. Then Abrahah Al-Ashram decided to force the Arabs to make their pilgrimage to this magnificent church, just as they had performed pilgrimage to the Ka`bah in Makkah. He announced this in his kingdom (Yemen), but it was rejected by the Arab tribes of `Adnan and Qahtan. The Quraysh were infuriated by it, so much so that one of them journeyed to the church and entered it one night. He then relieved himself in the church and ran away (escaping the people). When its custodians saw what he had done, they reported it to their king, Abrahah, saying; &#8220;One of the Quraysh has done this in anger over their House in whose place you have appointed this church.&#8221; Upon hearing this, Abrahah swore to march to the House of Makkah (the Ka`bah) and destroy it stone by stone. Muqatil bin Sulayman mentioned that a group of young men from the Quraysh entered the church and started a fire in it on an extremely windy day. So the church caught on fire and collapsed to the ground. Due to this Abrahah prepared himself and set out with a huge and powerful army so that none might prevent him from carrying out his mission. He took along a great, powerful elephant that had a huge body the like of which had never been seen before. This elephant was called Mahmud and it was sent to Abrahah from An-Najashi, the king of Abyssinia, particularly for this expedition. It has also been said that he had eight other elephants with him; their number was also reported to be twelve, plus the large one, Mahmud &#8212; and Allah knows best. Their intention was to use this big elephant to demolish the Ka`bah. They planned to do this by fastening chains to the pillars of the Ka`bah and placing the other ends around the neck of the elephant. Then they would make the elephant pull on them in order to tear down the walls of the Ka`bah all at one time. When the Arabs heard of Abrahah&#8217;s expedition, they considered it an extremely grave matter. They held it to be an obligation upon them to defend the Sacred House and repel whoever intended a plot against it. Thus, the noblest man of the people of Yemen and the greatest of their chiefs set out to face him (Abrahah). His name was Dhu Nafr. He called his people, and whoever would respond to his call among the Arabs, to go to war against Abrahah and fight in defense of the Sacred House. He called the people to stop Abrahah&#8217;s plan to demolish and tear down the Ka`bah. So the people responded to him and they entered into battle with Abrahah, but he defeated them. This was due to Allah&#8217;s will and His intent to honor and venerate the Ka`bah.</p>
<p>The army continued on its way until it came to the land of Khath`am where it was confronted by Nufayl bin Habib Al-Kath`ami along with his people, the Shahran and Nahis tribes. They fought Abrahah but he defeated them and captured Nufayl bin Habib. Initially he wanted to kill him, but he forgave him and took him as his guide to show him the way to Al-Hijaz.</p>
<p>When they approached the area of At-Ta&#8217;if, its people &#8212; the people of Thaqif &#8212; went out to Abrahah. They wanted to appease him because they were fearful for their place of worship, which they called Al-Lat. Abrahah was kind to them and they sent a man named Abu Righal with him as a guide. When they reached a place known as Al-Mughammas, which is near Makkah, they settled there. Then he sent his troops on a foray to capture the camels and other grazing animals of the Makkans, which they did, including about two hundred camels belonging to `Abdul-Muttalib. The leader of this particular expedition was a man named Al-Aswad bin Mafsud. According to what Ibn Ishaq mentioned, some of the Arabs used to satirize him (because of the part he played in this historical in this historical incident). Then Abrahah sent an emissary named Hanatah Al-Himyari to enter Makkah, commanding him to bring the head of the Quraysh to him. He also commanded him to inform him that the king will not fight the people of Makkah unless they try to prevent him from the destruction of the Ka`bah. Hanatah went to the city and he was directed to `Abdul-Muttalib bin Hashim, to whom he relayed Abrahah&#8217;s message. `Abdul-Muttalib replied, &#8220;By Allah! We have no wish to fight him, nor are we in any position to do so. This is the Sacred House of Allah, and the house of His Khalil, Ibrahim, and if He wishes to prevent him (Abrahah) from (destroying) it, it is His House and His Sacred Place (to do so). And if He lets him approach it, by Allah, We have no means to defend it from him.&#8221; So Hanatah told him, &#8220;Come with me to him (Abrahah).&#8221; And so `Abdul-Muttalib went with him. When Abrahah saw him, he was impressed by him, because `Abdul-Muttalib was a large and handsome man. So Abrahah descended from his seat and sat with him on a carpet on the ground. Then he asked his translator to say to him, &#8220;What do you need&#8221; `Abdul-Muttalib replied to the translator, &#8220;I want the king to return my camels which he has taken from me which are two hundred in number.&#8221; Abrahah then told his translator to tell him, &#8220;I was impressed by you when I first saw you, but now I withdraw from you after you have spoken to me. You are asking me about two hundred camels which I have taken from you and you leave the matter of a house which is (the foundation of) religion and the religion of your fathers, which I have come to destroy and you do not speak to me about it&#8221; `Abdul-Muttalib said to him, &#8220;Verily, I am the lord of the camels. As for the House, it has its Lord Who will defend it.&#8221; Abrahah said, &#8220;I cannot be prevented (from destroying it).&#8221; `Abdul-Muttalib answered, &#8220;Then do so.&#8221; It is said that a number of the chiefs of the Arabs accompanied `Abdul-Muttalib and offered Abrahah a third of the wealth of the tribe of Tihamah if he would withdraw from the House, but he refused and returned `Abdul-Muttalib&#8217;s camels to him. `Abdul-Muttalib then returned to his people and ordered them to leave Makkah and seek shelter at the top of the mountains, fearful of the excesses which might be committed by the army against them. Then he took hold of the metal ring of the door of the Ka`bah, and along with a number of Quraysh, he called upon Allah to give them victory over Abrahah and his army. `Abdul-Muttalib said, while hanging on to the ring of the Ka`bah&#8217;s door, &#8220;There is no matter more important to any man right now than the defense of his livestock and property. So, O my Lord! Defend Your property. Their cross and their cunning will not be victorious over your cunning by the time morning comes.&#8221; According to Ibn Ishaq, then `Abdul-Muttalib let go of the metal ring of the door of the Ka`bah, and they left Makkah and ascended to the mountains tops. Muqatil bin Sulayman mentioned that they left one hundred animals (camels) tied near the Ka`bah hoping that some of the army would take some of them without a right to do so, and thus bring about the vengeance of Allah upon themselves.</p>
<p>When morning came, Abrahah prepared to enter the sacred city of Makkah. He prepared the elephant named Mahmud. He mobilized his army, and they turned the elephant towards the Ka`bah. At that moment Nufayl bin Habib approached it and stood next to it, and taking it by its ear, he said, &#8220;Kneel, Mahmud! Then turn around and return directly to whence you came. For verily, you are in the Sacred City of Allah.&#8221; Then he released the elephant&#8217;s ear and it knelt, after which Nufayl bin Habib left and hastened to the mountains. Abrahah&#8217;s men beat the elephant in an attempt to make it rise, but it refused. They beat it on its head with axes and used hooked staffs to pull it out of its resistance and make it stand, but it refused. So they turned him towards Yemen, and he rose and walked quickly. Then they turned him towards Ash-Sham and he did likewise. Then they turned him towards the east and he did the same thing. Then they turned him towards Makkah and he knelt down again. Then Allah sent against them the birds from the sea, like swallows and herons. Each bird carried three stones the size of chickpeas and lentils, one in each claw and one in its beak. Everyone who was hit by them was destroyed, though not all of them were hit. They fled in panic along the road asking about the whereabouts of Nufayl that he might point out to them the way home. Nufayl, however, was at the top of the mountain with the Quraysh and the Arabs of the Hijaz observing the wrath which Allah had caused to descend on the people of the elephant. Nufayl then began to say, &#8220;Where will they flee when the One True God is the Pursuer For Al-Ashram is defeated and not the victor. Ibn Ishaq reported that Nufayl said these lines of poetry at that time,</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you live with continued support We favored you all with a revolving eye in the morning (i.e., a guide along the way). If you saw, but you did not see it at the side of the rock covered mountain that which we saw. Then you will excuse me and praise my affair, and do not grieve over what is lost between us. I praised Allah when I saw the birds, and I feared that the stones might be thrown down upon us. So all the people are asking about the whereabouts of Nufayl, as if I have some debt that I owe the Abyssinians.&#8221; `Ata&#8217; bin Yasar and others have said that all of them were not struck by the torment at this hour of retribution. Rather some of them were destroyed immediately, while others were gradually broken down limb by limb while trying to escape. Abrahah was of those who was broken down limb by limb until he eventually died in the land of Khath`am. Ibn Ishaq said that they left (Makkah) being struck down and destroyed along every path and at every water spring. Abrahah&#8217;s body was afflicted by the pestilence of the stones and his army carried him away with them as he was falling apart piece by piece, until they arrived back in San`a&#8217;. When they arrived there he was but like the baby chick of a bird. And he did not die until his heart fell out of his chest. So they claim. Ibn Ishaq said that when Allah sent Muhammad with the prophethood, among the things that he used to recount to the Quraysh as blessings that Allah had favored them with of His bounties, was His defending them from the attack of the Abyssinians. Due to this they (the Quraysh) were allowed to remain (safely in Makkah) for a period of time. Thus, Allah said,</p>
<p>(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant Did He not make their plot go astray And He sent against them birds, in flocks (Ababil). Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like `Asf, Ma&#8217;kul.)</p>
<p>(For the Ilaf of the Quraysh, their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer. So, let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.) (106:1-4) meaning, that Allah would not alter their situation because Allah wanted good for them if they accepted Him. Ibn Hisham said, &#8220;Al-Ababil are the groups, as the Arabs do not speak of just one (bird).&#8221; He also said, &#8220;As for As-Sijjil, Yunus An-Nahwi and Abu `Ubaydah have informed me that according to the Arabs, it means something hard and solid.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Some of the commentators have mentioned that it is actually two Persian words that the Arabs have made into one word. The two words are Sanj and Jil, Sanj meaning stones, and Jil meaning clay. The rocks are of these two types: stone and clay.&#8221; He continued saying, &#8220;Al-`Asf are the leaves of the crops that are not gathered. One of them is called `Asfah.&#8221; This is the end of what he mentioned. Hammad bin Salamah narrated from `Asim, who related from Zirr, who related from `Abdullah and Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that they said,</p>
<p>(birds Ababil.) &#8220;In groups.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak both said, &#8220;Ababil means some of them following after others.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Qatadah both said, &#8220;Ababil means many.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;Ababil means in various, successive groups.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;Ababil means different, coming from here and there. They came upon them from everywhere.&#8221; Al-Kasa&#8217;i said, &#8220;I heard some of the grammarians saying, &#8220;The singular of Ababil is Ibil.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded from Ishaq bin `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p>(And He sent against them birds, Ababil.) &#8220;This means in divisions just as camels march in divisions (in their herds).&#8221; It is reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p>(And He sent against them birds, Ababil.) &#8220;They had snouts like the beaks of birds and paws like the paws of dogs.&#8221; It has been reported that `Ikrimah said commenting on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p>(birds, Ababil.) &#8220;They were green birds that came out of the sea and they had heads like the heads of predatory animals.&#8221; It has been reported from `Ubayd bin `Umayr that he commented:</p>
<p>(birds, Ababil.) &#8220;They were black birds of the sea that had stones in their beaks and claws.&#8221; And the chains of narration (for these statements) are all authentic. It is reported from `Ubayd bin `Umayr that he said, &#8220;When Allah wanted to destroy the People of the Elephant, he sent birds upon them that came from sea swallows. Each of the birds was carrying three small stones &#8212; two stones with its feet and one stone in its beak. They came until they gathered in rows over their heads. Then they gave a loud cry and threw what was in their claws and beaks. Thus, no stone fell upon the head of any man except that it came out of his behind (i.e., it went through him), and it did not fall on any part of his body except that it came out from the opposite side. Then Allah sent a severe wind that struck the stones and increased them in force. Thus, they were all destroyed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever asks Allah sincerely for martyrdom [Allahumma inni as&#8217;aluk ash-shahadah], Allah will cause him to reach the status of the martyrs even if he dies in his bed.”</span></em> [&#8216;Sahih al-Bukhari&#8217;; # 1909]&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-`Adawee said it was sound, and that it was reported by by Muslim, page 55 of volume 13; Abu Dãwood, page 179 of volume 2; and Ibn Mãjah, #2797.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Umm Waraqah bint ‘Abdullaah bin Haarith Ansariah (radiallaahu ‘anhaa) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ Umm Waraqah! Dwell in your House, Allaah will give you the death of a martyr”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ansaar of Al-Madeenah were standing on the outskirts of their city, looking with inpatient eyes towards the road approaching from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men, women, girls and boys, the young and the old were waiting for the arrival of their beloved Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam who was migrating from his city to theirs at their invitation and at the command of Allaah, subhanna wa ta’alaa. Suddenly someone shouted, “ Here they come!”. And all the young girls and women burst into a song of praise of Allaah subhanna wa ta’alaa and a welcome to His Messenger salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the Ansaaree women was Umm Waraaqah bint ‘Abdullaah radiallaahu ‘anha. She was a learned, scholarly, pious and modest lady , who was well known amongst the female companions (May Allaah be pleased with them) as one who spent her nights and days in prayer and meditation. She used to recite the Noble Qu’raan beautifully; it was second nature for her to spend a lot of time meditating on the meaning of its Verses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam valued her highly and he told her to lead the family in congregational prayers. The courtyard of the house was converted into a masjid; with the permission of the Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam they had a Mu’aadheen to give the call for prayers. ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Khaalad says that he saw the Mu’aadheen, who was a very aged man. Thus Umm Waraqah bint ‘Abdullaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa was appointed by the Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam to be an Imaam and lead the prayers for the women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides her thirst for knowledge of the Qu’raan, Shar’eeah (Islaamic legislation) and Ahaadeeth, Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa had a burning desire to die as a martyr in the cause of al-Islaam. When it was announced that the army should prepare to leave for the battle of Badr, Umm Waraaqah radiallaahu ‘anhaa went to the Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam and volunteered her services to tend to the wounded in the battlefield. She told him salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam that it was her earnest desire to die in the cause of al-Islaam. The Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam could see her enthusiasm and ardour but he told her to stay at home and she would attain martyrdom there. She went back happily because it was her duty to yield to the command of the Messenger of Allaah salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam would sometimes take along some of His Companions and visit the home of Umm Waraaqah radiallaahu ‘anhaa. He would tell them to accompany him to the house of the lady who was a living martyr. He would ask about her welfare, rest for awhile and then offer supplications to Allaah, the High, for her well being and return. Allaah subhanna wa ta’alaa revealed to His beloved Messenger salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam that Umm Waraaqaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa would die the death of a martyr in her own home. Nobody could understand how this would take place with her sitting in her house, but they were sure it would definitly happen, as this news had been given by their truthful Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa herself was awaiting every moment to see how this auspicious event, which would be the fulfillment of her greatest dream, would take place. She waited patiently, for it would give her eternal life and a place in Paradise. When would it take place? How exactly would it take place? What shape would it take? How would it be possible to become a martyr sitting in the house? Lossed in these thoughts she passed her nights and her days. The Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam passed. Abu Bakr Siddique radiallaahu ‘anhu succeeded and he also passed; ‘Umaar Farooq radiallaahu ‘anhu became the Khalifa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa had two slaves working for her, a girl and a man. She told them that after her death they would be free. One day they got together and decided that they were tired of waiting for this old lady to die. The planned to kill her in her sleep and escape to freedom. They were so tempted by the thought of freedom that they forgot to consider their future as well as their life in the Aakhiraah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the dead of night as Umm Waraqah radiallaahu ‘anhaa lay in a deep sleep, they killed her, covered her body with a sheet and crept away from the house silently. As day broke and the sun came up, the neighbours missed the sound of the beautiful recitation of the Noble Qu’raan by Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa which used to fill the air early in the dawn. When they entered the house they were shocked to see her lying in the sleep of death. Then they saw that both the slaves were missing. They realized that they must be criminals. ‘Umaar ibn al-Khattaab radiallaahu ‘anhu ordered that people should be sent out to search for them. Finally, they were found hiding. When they were brought before the Khalifa in court, they admitted their guilt and were put to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the Prophet salAllaahu ‘alaihi wa salaam was proven right, that Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ‘anhaa died the death of a martyr in her own home, and attained Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, the pious will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers. In a seat of truth, near the Omnipotent King (Allaah, the One, the All-Blessed, the Most High, the Owner of Majesty and Honour) – 54:54-55</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">From last hadith in The Book of Revelation of the 1st Volume of Sahih Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius&#8217;s question said to them, &#8220;Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&#8221; Abu Sufyan replied, &#8220;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8220;Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allaah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What is his family status amongst you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius further asked, &#8216;Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Do the nobles or the poor follow him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;They are increasing.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Does he break his promises?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.&#8217; I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Have you ever had a war with him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, &#8216;What was the outcome of the battles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, <strong>&#8216;He tells us to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Messengers come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man&#8217;s statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allaah.</strong></span> I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Messengers have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Messengers never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: &#8220;In the name of Allaah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Allaah will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allaah&#8217;s Statement:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Allaah and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to Allaah).</strong> (3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan then added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allaah guided me to it).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub narrator adds, &#8220;Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya&#8217; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&#8217; (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &#8216;At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to Heraclius was brought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &#8216;Arabs also practice circumcision.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the &#8216;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, &#8216;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When they returned) he said, &#8216;What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&#8217; The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&#8217;s story (in connection with his faith).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hirrahamanirraheem , Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil Aalameen</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We begin by relating to you the story of the just king Nooruddin Mahmoud zunki , May Allah’s mercy be upon him, that took place in the year 557 after hijra. He was ruling the Greater Syria area and he saw a magnificent dream, which made him go to the city of Madina. He saw Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam three times in one night and in every time Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam telling him O’ Mahmoud save me from these two individuals while pointing towards to blond individuals in front of him. So the king summoned his minister before dawn and told him about this so the minister said this is a matter which may have taken place in Madina, the Madina of Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he prepared himself and quickly hastened over 1000 mounts and horses and other than that until he entered in Madina quietly and secretly with his minster and he came to Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s masjid not knowing what to do. So the minister said do you recognize these two individuals if you see them ?. He said yes .So he summoned the people to give them charity and distributed to them plenty of gold and silver and he said that no one in Madina should stay except, known in madina should stay but rather should come to receive the charity. Only two people didn’t come to collect the Sadaqa. They remained close by the masjid from Andulisya (currently Spain), in a place which in the direction of the qibla from the side of the apartment of Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam close to the house of Umar Ibn Al Khattab that is where they stayed so they came or he summoned them to come for the sadqa, they refused and they said that “what we have is sufficient. We don’t accept anything”. So he stressed they should come and insisted and so they were brought. When the minister saw them, he said to him are they the same individuals? So he asked them on their condition and what brought them here .they said “we came to be close by the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasalam” . He said you should speak the truth and repeated the question several times until <strong>they confessed that they were christians and that they were on a mission to remove the body of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam </strong>in agreement with their teams and he found that they dug a tunnel from the side of the qibla by the wall of the masjid in the direction of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s apartment and they collected the dust of the soil in a well inside their residence. So he beheaded them outside the masjid and returned to as shams and he commanded that the area around the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s site of burial be dug and he commanded that lead be poured around lest some enemies or to prevent anyone from reaching Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s site of burial .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A righteous man was once asked to tell the story of the pivotal moment of his life, the moment in which he first began to apply the teachings of Islam, and the following was his answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was a young man, I would not hesitate to perpetrate any sin that was made available to me. Then, one day, I saw a young woman who was perhaps the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Much tempted by her, I indicated to her that I wanted her to approach me. She seemed nervous, but I thought that she would probably agree to satisfy my sexual desires for money. She approached me with what seemed to be a great deal of trepidation, and when she actually stood before me, she looked extremely terrified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Feeling sorry for her, I said, &#8216;Do not fear, for I will not harm you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But my words did not lessen her terrible fright in the least; in fact, her situation worsened. She began to tremble like a palm tree leaf trembles with the wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;Tell me your story.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8216;By Allah, o my brother, never before this day have I offered my body in this way. Dire need is what has driven me to this, for I have three daughters who have not eaten a single morsel of food for three days now. It was pity for them that brought me to this low point in my life.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first time in my life, I felt pity; her story moved me, and I no longer entertained the intention of taking advantage of her. After she told me where she lived, I took a great deal of money, clothing and food to her house. When I returned to my house, I told my mother what had happened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother knew that I had a book in which I would record all of my evil deeds, and so she said to me, &#8216;My son, you are a man who has never performed a good deed except for the good deed that you performed today. I know that you have a book in which you record your evil exploits, go now and write in it your good deed.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I stood up, went to my book, opened it, and found that all of its pages were blank- except for the first page on which was written a single line.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ الْحَسَنَاتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّيِّئَاتِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hud : 114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At that very moment, I raised my hands to the sky and said, &#8216;By your Might and Majesty, never again will I disobey You.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sahih Bukhari , Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</span></p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <em>Surat-al-Baqara</em> and <em>Al-Imran,</em> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Surah As-Saffaat</strong>  &#8211; <span style="color:#008000;">(50. Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning.) (51. A speaker of them will say: &#8220;Verily, I had a companion (in the world),&#8221;) (52. &#8220;Who used to say: `Are you among those who believe.) (53.

Truly, this is the supreme success!) (61. For the like of this let the workers work.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mentioned the story of two men among the Children of Israel who were partners and who are included in the meaning of this Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Furat bin Tha`labah Al-Bahrani said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, I had a companion)</span> [ 37. As-Saffaat verse 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There were two men who were partners and had collected eight thousand Dinars. One of them had a craft and the other did not. The one who had a craft said to the other, `You do not have a craft, so I think I will divide the money with you and leave you.&#8217; So he left him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then the first man bought a house</strong>, belonging to a king who had died, for the price of one thousand Dinars. He called his companion and showed him the house, saying, `What do you think of this house I bought it for one thousand Dinars.&#8217; He said, `How beautiful it is.&#8217; When he went out he said, `O Allah, this companion of mine has bought this house for one thousand Dinars; I ask You for one of the houses of Paradise &#8211; and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity.&#8217; Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first man married a woman</strong> with a dowry of one thousand Dinars, and invited his companion and made food for him. When he came, he said, `I have married this woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars.&#8217; He replied; `How beautiful this is.&#8217; And when he left, he said, `O Lord, my companion has married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars; I ask you for a wife from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn&#8217; &#8212; and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity. Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then the first man bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars</strong>, then he called his companion and showed them to him. He said, `I have bought these two gardens for two thousand Dinars.&#8217; He replied, `How beautiful this is.&#8217; When he came out, he said, `O Lord, my companion has bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars; I ask you for two gardens in Paradise&#8217; &#8212; and he gave two thousand Dinars in charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel came to them and took their souls in death. He took the one who had given his money in charity and put him in a house that he liked. There, there was a woman who was so beautiful that the ground shinned under her, then he (the angel) took him to two gardens and gave him other things which are known only to Allah. The man said, `This is like a man who has such and such.&#8217; The angel said, `That is exactly what it is; this house, these gardens and this wife are all for you.&#8217; The man said, `I had a companion who used to say: Are you among those who believe&#8217; It was said to him, `He is in Hell.&#8217; He said, `Will you look down&#8217; So he looked down and saw him in the midst of Hell. At this, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(By Allah! You have nearly ruined me. Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).)&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : <strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(260. And (remember) when Ibrahim said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.&#8221;)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khalil Supplicates to Allah to Show Him How He Resurrects the Dead</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that there are reasons behind this request by Ibrahim. For instance, when Ibrahim said to Nimrod, (My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death,) he wanted to solidify his knowledge about resurrection by actually witnessing it with his eyes. Prophet Ibrahim said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(&#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>(We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; Allah said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe&#8221; Ibrahim said, &#8220;Yes (I believe), but (I ask) in order to be stronger in faith.&#8221;)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet&#8217;s statement in the Hadith means, &#8220;We are more liable to seek certainty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer to Al-Khalil&#8217;s Request:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(He said: &#8220;Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the type of birds mentioned here, although this matter in not relevant due to the fact that the Qur&#8217;an did not mention it. Allah&#8217;s statement, (cause them to incline towards you) means, cut them to pieces. This is the explanation of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Al-Aswad Ad-Dili, Wahb bin Munabbih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Ibrahim caught four birds, slaughtered them, removed the feathers, tore the birds to pieces and mixed the pieces together. He then placed parts of these mixed pieces on four or seven hills. Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Ibrahim kept the heads of these birds in his hand. Next, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call the birds to him, and he did as Allah commanded him. Ibrahim witnessed the feathers, blood and flesh of these birds fly to each other, and the parts flew each to their bodies, until every bird came back to life and came walking at a fast pace towards Ibrahim, so that the example that Ibrahim was witnessing would become more impressive. Each bird came to collect its head from Ibrahim&#8217;s hand, and if he gave the bird another head the bird refused to accept it. When Ibrahim gave each bird its own head, the head was placed on its body by Allah&#8217;s leave and power. &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said,<br />
(And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) and no one can overwhelm or resist Him. Whatever Allah wills, occurs without hindrance, because He is the All-Mighty, Supreme above all things, and He is Wise in His statements, actions, legislation and decrees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said that Ayyub said that Ibn `Abbas commented on what Ibrahim said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but to be stronger in Faith)</strong>, &#8220;To me, there is no Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that brings more hope than this Ayah.&#8221; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, &#8220;Which Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an carries more hope for you&#8221; Ibn `Amr said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(Say: &#8220;O `Ibadi (My servants) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not.)</em></span> (39:53).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;But I say that it is Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe)&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah accepted Ibrahim&#8217;s affirmation when he merely said, `Yes.&#8217; This Ayah refers to the doubts that attack the heart and the thoughts that Shaytan inspires.&#8221; Al-Hakim also recorded this in Al-Mustadrak and said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih but they did not record it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source :Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Suratul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death Allah said to them, &#8220;Die&#8221;. And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.) [Surah Baqarah Verse243]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abu Hatim related that Ibn `Abbas said that these people mentioned herein, were the residents of a village called Dawardan. `Ali bin `Asim said that they were from Dawardan, a village several miles away from Wasit (in Iraq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Tafsir, Waki` bin Jarrah said that Ibn `Abbas commented,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death) that they were four thousand persons who escaped the plague (that broke out in their land). They said, &#8220;We should go to a land</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that is free of death!&#8221; When they reached a certain area, Allah said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Die.&#8221;) and they all died. Afterwards, one of the Prophets passed by them and supplicated to Allah to resurrect them and Allah brought them back to life. So, Allah stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, several scholars among the Salaf said that these people were the residents of a city during the time of the Children of Israel. The weather in their land did not suit them and an epidemic broke out. They fled their land fearing death and took refuge in the wilderness. They later arrived at a fertile valley and they filled what is between its two sides. Then Allah sent two angels to them, one from the lower side and the other from the upper side of the valley. The angels screamed once and all the people died instantly, just as the death of one man. They were later moved to a different place, where walls and graves were built around them. They all perished, and their bodies rotted and disintegrated. Long afterwards, one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel, whose name was <strong>Hizqil (Ezekiel)</strong>, passed by them and asked Allah to bring them back to life by his hand. Allah accepted his supplication and commanded him to say, &#8220;O rotted bones, Allah commands you to come together.&#8221; The bones of every body were brought together. Allah then commanded him to say, &#8220;O bones, Allah commands you to be covered with flesh, nerves and skin.&#8221; That also happened while Hizqil was watching. Allah then commanded him to say, &#8220;O souls, Allah commands you to return, each to the body that it used to inhabit.&#8221; They all came back to life, looked around and proclaimed, &#8220;All praise is due to You (O Allah!) and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.&#8221; Allah brought them back to life after they had perished long ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state that bringing these people back to life is a clear proof that physical resurrection shall occur on the Day of Resurrection.<br />
This is why Allah said:<br />
(Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind,) meaning, in that He shows them His great signs, sound proofs and clear evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, (but most men thank not.) as they do not thank Allah for what He has given them with in their worldly life and religious affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of the dead people (2:244 above) also indicates that no caution can ever avert destiny and that there is no refuge from Allah, but to Allah Himself. These people departed from their land fleeing the epidemic and seeking to enjoy a long life. What they earned was the opposite of what they sought, as death came quickly and instantaneously and seized them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an authentic Hadith that Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once went to Ash-Sham (Syria). When he reached the area of Sargh, he was met by the commanders of the army: Abu `Ubaydah bin Jarrah and his companions. They told him that the plague had broken out in Ash-Sham. The Hadith then mentioned that `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, who was away attending to some of his affairs, came and said, &#8220;I have knowledge regarding this matter. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Peace be upon him) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If it (the plague) breaks out in a land that you are in, do not leave that land to escape from it. If you hear about it in a land, do not enter it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then thanked Allah and went back. This Hadith is also reported in the Sahihayn.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shytaan appears as a sincere adviser to humans</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> : Quoted in ibn al-Jauzi, Talbees Iblees, p.39</p>
<blockquote><p>“And he swore unto them (saying): Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you” (al-Araaf 21).</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahb ibn Munabbih has related the following lengthy story from the people of the book.” We present it here to show the way of Shytan in his attempt to mislead mankind. The story warns humans about Shytan”s “sincere advice”. One must oppose the thing that Shytan is calling to. Wahb said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a pious worshipper of the tribe of Israel. He was the most pious person of his time. During his time, there were three brothers who had a sister. She was a virgin. And they had no sister other than her. They were all about to leave the town to go to war. They did not know with whom to leave their sister and who they could trust to look after her. They all agreed to leave her with that pious person. They all trusted him. They went to him and asked if they could leave her with him. She would be in the building next to him until they return from the fighting. He refused their request and sought refuge in Allah from them and their sister. They persisted until he finally acquiesced. He said, “Put her in the house next to my place of worship.” So they put her in that house and they left, leaving her there. She remained living next to that pious person for some time. He would put food for her in front of his building of worship. Then he would lock the door and return to his place of worship. He would then tell her to come out of her house and take the food. Then Shytan approached him softly. He encouraged him to treat her kindly. He told him that it was not good to make the woman come out of her house during the day as someone may come upon her. If he took the food directly to her door that would mean a greater reward for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued for some time to go to her door and place the food at the front of her door without speaking to her. Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to do good and get more reward. He said, “If you took her the food and placed it in the house for her, you would get a greater reward.” He continued to encourage him. So he started to take the food into her house. He continued like that for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and again encouraged him to do good. He said, “If you talk to her for a while she will be put to ease by your conversation as she is in a state of fear and she is all alone.” He then started talking to her from atop his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again. He said, “If you were to come down and talk to her while she sits at her door and talks to you, that would be even more comforting for her.” He continued to encourage him until he came down and sat at his door and would talk to her. The girl would come out of her building and sit at her door and they would talk for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to get great rewards for treating her well. He said, “If you were to go from the door of your place of worship and sit close to her door, that would be even more comforting for her.” He continued exhorting him until he did so. He continued that act for a while. Then Iblees came again. This time he said, “If you enter her house and talk to her, and not make her show her face in public it would be even better for you.” He continued exhorting him until he entered her house and spent the whole day talking to her. Then when night fell, he returned to his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came to him after that and continued to make her more appealing to him. Until the worshipper got upon her and kissed her. And Iblees continued to make her look nice in his eyes and desire her until he finally had sex with her. She got pregnant and gave birth to a boy. Then Iblees came and told the worshipper, “Do you not realize what the brothers of the girl will do to you when they see she has given birth to your son” You will not be safe if your matter becomes clear. You should go to the boy and kill it and bury it, that way you can conceal your affair and they will not do anything to you for what you did to her.” Then he said to him, “Do you think she will conceal from her brothers what you did to her and your killing of her son. Take her, kill her and bury her with her son.” He continued spurring him on until he killed her and threw her in the ditch with her son. Then he put a large rock over them and leveled it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he returned to his place of worship and worshipped therein. He stayed in that state for as long as Allah willed until the brothers came back from the fighting. They came to him and asked him about their sister. He mourned her loss and started to cry. He said, “She was the best of women and that is her grave.” The brothers came to the grave and cried over their sister and asked Allah to have mercy on her. They stayed at her grave for a few days and then went to their families. When the night overtook them and they went to their beds, Shytan came to them in their sleep in the form of a traveler. He started with the eldest and asked him about their sister. The brother told him what the pious man had stated and how they were shown her grave. Shytan told him that the pious man had lied. He said, “He did not tell you the truth about your sister. He got her pregnant and she had his son and then he killed and buried her out of fear of you. Then he threw them in a ditch he dug behind the door of the house she was staying in, to the right of the entrance. Go and enter the house in which she stayed and on the right of the entrance you will find everything I told you about.” Then he went to the middle brother and did the same. Then he went to the youngest brother and did the same. When they woke, they were all surprised at what they had seen. When they met each other, they all said, “Isaw an amazing thing last night,” and they informed each other of what they had seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eldest said, “That dream has nothing to it so just ignore it.” The youngest said, “I will not leave it until I go and look at that place.” They all went until they reached the door of the place where there sister stayed. They opened the door and looked for the place that was described to them in their dreams. They found their sister and her son buried in a ditch, as they were told. They asked the worshipper about it and he confirmed what Iblees had told them. They then took him and were about to crucify him. When they had him on the wooden cross, Shytan said to him, “You know that I am your companion who tempted you by the woman until you got her pregnant and you killed her and her son. If you obey me today and deny Allah, who formed and shaped you, I will rescue you from your predicament.” The worshipper then belied Allah. When he belied Allah, Shytan left from being between him and the others and they were able to crucify him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars related this story in their commentary to the following verse,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Or the likeness of Shytan when he tells man to disbelieve, then, when he disbelieves, says to him,  “Lo! I am innocent of you. Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds” ” (Surah al-Hasr 16).</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention that this verse refers to this worshipper and to others similar to him. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">This story, and others similar to it, are from the Israaeeliyaat or stories which have their source in the books or tales of the Jews and Christians. We do not say it is true nor do we say it is false, but it is allowed to narrate them as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Narrate stories about the Tribe of Israel if there is no harm in that.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A burglar scaled the wall of Maalik bin Dinar&#8217;s house one night and easily managed to get inside. Once inside the house, the thief was disappointed to see that there was nothing inside actually worth stealing. The owner of the home was inside at the time, he was busy performing prayer. Realizing that he was not alone, Maalik quickly ended his prayer and turned around to face the thief. Without showing any sign of being shocked or afraid, Maalik calmly extended greetings of peace and then said, &#8220;My brother, may Allah forgive you. You entered my home and found nothing that is worth taking, yet I do not want you to leave my home without taking away some benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stood up, went to another part of the room, and came back with a jug full of water. He looked into the eyes of the burglar and said, &#8220;Make ablution and perform two units of prayer, for if you do so, you will leave my home with a greater treasure than you had initially sought when you entered it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Much humbled by Maalik&#8217;s manners and words, the thief said, &#8220;Yes, that is a generous offer indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After making ablution and performing two units of prayer, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, would you mind if I stayed for a while, for I want to stay to perform two more units of prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Stay for whatever amount of prayer Allah decrees for you to perform now.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thief ended up spending the entire night at Maalik&#8217;s house. He continued to pray until the morning. Then Maalik said, &#8220;Leave now and be good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But instead of leaving, the thief said, &#8220;Would you mind if I stayed here with you today, for I have made an intention to fast the day?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Stay as long as you wish,&#8221; said Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The burglar ended up staying for a number of days, praying during the late hours of each night and fasting throughout the duration of each day. When he finally decided to leave, the burglar said, &#8220;O Maalik, I have made a firm resolve to repent for my sins and for my former way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik said, &#8220;Indeed, that is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man did mend his ways and began to lead a life of righteousness and obedience to Allah. Later on, He came across another burglar he knew. [His friend] said to him, &#8220;Have you found your treasure yet?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;My brother, what I found is Maalik bin Dinaar. I went to steal from him, but it was he who ended up stealing my heart. I have indeed repented to Allah, and I will remain at the door [of His Mercy and Forgiveness] until I achieve what his obedient, loving slaves have achieved.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Interesting Story !! Read on ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an interesting story related about Dinaar al-&#8216;Ayaar. Dinaar had a righteous mother who would constantly advise him to repent for his wayward, sinful existence, but as much as she tried, her words had no positive effect on him whatsoever. Then, one day, as he was walking by a graveyard, he stopped to pick up a bone. He was shocked to see how it crumbled and turned to dust in his hand. The sight of that bone had a profound effect on Dinaar. He began to think about his life and his past sins, and he then exclaimed, &#8220;Woe unto you, O Dinaar, you are going to end up like this crushed bone, and your body will turn into dust.&#8221; All of his past sins then flashed before his eyes, and he made a firm resolve to repent. Turning his gaze towards the sky, he said, &#8220;My Lord, I now turn to you in complete submission, so accept me and have Mercy on me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With a completely changed heart and state of mind, Dinaar went to his mother and said, &#8220;Mother, what does a master do when he captures his slave who had run away from him?&#8221; She said, &#8220;[To punish him] the master provides him with coarse clothing and low-quality food; and he ties his hands and feet so that he does not make another attempt to escape.&#8221; Dinaar said, &#8220;Then I want a garment made of coarse wool, low-quality barley, and two chains. Mother, do with me that which is done with a runaway slave. Perhaps my Lord will, upon seeing my humiliation and humility, have mercy on me.&#8221; Seeing that her son was adamant and resolute in his request, she complied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the beginning of every ensuing night, Dinaar would begin to cry and wail uncontrollably. And he would continue to repeat to himself the words, &#8220;Woe unto you, O Dinaar, do you have the power to withstand the Hell fire? How brazen you have been to have led a life that has made you deserving of the anger of the All-Mighty!&#8221; He would continue upon that state until the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Turning wan and pale, Dinaar&#8217;s body slowly wasted away. Not being able to bear seeing him in that pitiable state, his mother said, &#8220;My son, be easy on yourself.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;My mother, let me remain tied for a short while, so that perhaps I can achieve long-term comfort later on. For tomorrow, I will be waiting a long time before my Majestic Lord, and I do not know whether He will order me to go to places of beautiful shade or to places of unspeakable horror.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;My son, at least rest for a while.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is not present rest or comfort that I am seeking out. Mother, it is as if I see you and other people being led tomorrow towards Paradise, while I am being led towards the Hell-fire along with his inhabitants.&#8221; She left him then, and he returned to crying, worshipping, and reciting the Quran. One night, as he was reciting the Quran, he came across these verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْأَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِين عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ َ<br />
<strong>So, by your Lord [o Muhammad], We shall certainly call all of them to account, for all that they used to do.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[al-Hijr : 92-93]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As he contemplated the meanings and implications of these verses, he cried with such intensity that he fainted. His mother rushed to him and tried very hard to revive him, but he wouldn&#8217;t respond. She thought he had died. Looking into the face of her son, she said, &#8220;O my beloved one, O the joy of my heart, where shall we meet again?&#8221; In fact, Dinaar still had some life left in him, and hearing his mother&#8217;s words, he answered with a faint voice, &#8220;My mother, if you do not find me on the wide plains of the Day of Resurrection, then ask Maalik, the Custodian of Hell-fire about me.&#8221; He then made a croaking sound and died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After she finished washing his body, Dinaar&#8217;s mother prepared him for his funeral. She then went out and made the announcement, &#8220;O people, come to the funeral prayer of one who has been killed by [fear of] the Hell-fire.&#8221; People began to come from all directions. It is said that during that era, no greater gathering came together and no amount of tears were shed as much as on that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the same night that his funeral was held, one of Dinaar&#8217;s friends saw him in a dream, attired in a green robe. Dinaar was prancing around in Paradise, all the while reciting the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْأَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِين عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ َ<br />
<strong>So, by your Lord [o Muhammad], We shall certainly call all of them to account, for all that they used to do.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the dream, his friend heard him say, &#8220;By His Might and Majesty, He asked me [about my deeds]. Having mercy on me, He forgave me and pardoned me [my sins.] Lo! Convey news of this to my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The above story is taken from &#8220;The Stories of repentence&#8221; published by dar-us-salam</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Yusuf bin Al-Husain is the narrator of this story:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Dhi-an-Nun on the edge of a stream, when we saw an extraordinarily large lizard crawling along the side of the stream. Something strange yet wonderful then happened. A frog surfaced from the stream, the lizard mounted its back, and the frog then swam to the other side of the stream, carrying its passenger on its back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhi-an-Nun said, &#8220;There is something interesting about that lizard let us go and follow it.&#8221; We crossed the stream (which wasn&#8217;t so wide in width), and on the other side, we saw a drunken man who had passed out. Suddenly, a snake appeared before the prone body of the drunkard. It slithered its way up to the man&#8217;s navel to his chest, making a direct course to one of his ears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lizard we saw earlier then sprang into action. It jumped onto the snake and struck it violently, splitting its body into two. Returning to the edge of the stream, the lizard then mounted the frog again, and the two crossed to the other side of the stream, though both were still visible to us. Dhi-an-Nun woke up the drunkard, who slowly opened his eyes and became conscious of what was happening around him. Dhi-an-Nun said, &#8220;O young man, look how Allah has saved you! When this snake came to kill you, that lizard came and killed it. He then explained the entire story to the young man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young man stood up and exclaimed: &#8220;O my lord, this is how you deal with one who disobeys you, then what will your mercy be like for the one who obeys you?&#8221; He then betook himself to the desert, vowing to dedicate his life to worship and to never return to the evils of the city.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THERE IS HOPE UNTIL THE VERY END</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, as Ali bin Abi Taalib and al-Hussain bin Ali were walking together, they heard a man supplicating to Allah. The man was begging Allah to forgive him for his evil crimes. His sincere tone and eloquent words aroused the interest of Ali, who turned to his son and said, &#8220;Do you not hear the man who is so very contrite because of his sins? Go catch up with him and call him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When al-Hussain caught up with the man, he saw that he was clean-looking, clean-smelling, with nice clothes and altogether handsome- except that he seemed to be paralyzed on the right side of his body. Al-Hussain said, &#8220;Answer the summons of the Leader of the believers, Ali bin Abu Taalib.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dragging his right side, the man followed al-Hussain back to where Ali was waiting for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Who are you and what is your story,&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My story is that of a man who did not fulfill the rights of others and is now being punished for that,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And what is your name?&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Munaazil bin Laahiq,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And what is your story?&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was famous among the Arabs for my frivolous and sinful exploits. Merciful and kind, my father would constantly admonish me and advise me to mend my ways. He would remind me of Allah&#8217;s punishment, saying, &#8216;My son, do not go against He who punishes with the Hell-fire!&#8217; When he would persist in advising me, I felt his voice grating on my nerves. I would get so frustrated that I would beat him with harsh blows. In response to my blows, he one day said, &#8216;By Allah, I will fast without breaking my fast and I will pray without stopping to sleep.&#8217; He fasted for an entire week, but seeing no change in my behavior, he climbed a camel and set off to perform Hajj. His parting words were, &#8216;I am going to the House of Allah, and there I will seek help from Allah against you.&#8217; When he reached Makkah, he embraced the curtain of the Kaa&#8217;ba and supplicated against me, asking Allah to make me paralyzed on one side of my body. By the One Who raised the sky and sends down the rain, no sooner did my father finish his supplication than I became paralyzed on my right side, which became like a piece of wood. Anyone that would then pass by me would point to me and say, &#8216;Allah answered his father&#8217;s supplication against him.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What did your father do then?&#8221; asked Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Leader of the Believers, after he became pleased with me, I asked him to go back and invoke Allah on my behalf. He agreed to do so. I walked alongside him as he rode on his camel, until we reached a place called the Valley of Arak. When we reached there, a group of birds flew away from a tree, their sudden movement frightened the camel. As the camel raced off in a state of fright, my father fell off it and died.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was certainly late for the man, but not too late, and so Ali advised him to continue to supplicate and to repent for his past misdeeds. Ali then parted from the man, but before leaving him, he taught him the supplication that a person in distress should say. [The narration does not specifically mention which supplication it was that Ali taught the man.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE EVER-LIVING NEVER SLEEPS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both of them lived in a small town that was populated by only tens or hundreds of people. He was in love with her, and so when he saw her walking alone one night, he followed her until he had her cornered. When he came near to her, he said, &#8220;Woman, I crave for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;First go and see if all the people are asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Very pleased at her response, he walked around the town and returned. &#8220;Everyone is asleep,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What about Allah Azza wa Jal?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Is He sleeping at this hour?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Woman, what are you saying?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Indeed, Allah does not sleep: neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The One Who hasn&#8217;t slept and doesn&#8217;t sleep sees us, even if people don&#8217;t see us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you not fear He Who neither sleeps nor is heedless of anything that happens?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man left her alone with tears flowing from his eyes, having nothing in mind except the desire to repent to the One Who neither sleeps nor is heedless of anything that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">His name was unusual and incomplete. Julaybib (Radhi Allaahu Anhu) means &#8220;small grown&#8221; being the diminutive form of the word &#8220;Jalbab.&#8221; The name is an indication that Julaybib was small and short, even of dwarf-like stature. More than that, he is described as being &#8220;damim&#8221; which means ugly, deformed, or of repulsive appearance. Even more disturbing, for the society in which he lived, Julaybib&#8217;s lineage was not known. There is no record of who his mother of his father was or to what tribe he belonged. This was a grave disability in the society in which he lived. Julaybib could not expect any compassion or help, any protection or support from a society that placed a great deal of importance on family and tribal connections. In this regard, all that was known of him was that he was an Arab and that, as far as the new community of Islam was concerned, he was one of the Ansar. Perhaps he belonged to one of the outlying tribes beyond Madinah and had drifted into the city or he could have even been from among the Ansar of the city itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disabilities under which Julaybib lived would have been enough to have him ridiculed and shunned in any society and in fact he was prohibited by one person, a certain Abu Barzah of the Aslam tribe, from entering his home. He once told his wife: &#8220;Do not let Julaybib enter among you. If he does, I shall certainly do (something terrible to him).&#8221; Probably because he was teased and scoffed at in the company of men, Julaybib used to take refuge in the company of women. Was there any hope of Julaybib being treated with respect and consideration? Was there any hope of his finding emotional satisfaction as an individual and as a man? Was there any hope of his enjoying the relationships which others take for granted? And in the society emerging under the guidance of the Prophet, was he so insignificant as to be overlooked in the preoccupation with the great affairs of the state and in the supreme issues of life and survival which constantly engaged the attention of the Prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he was aware of the great issues of life and destiny, the Prophet of Mercy (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) was also aware of the needs and sensibilities of his most humble companions. With Julaybib in mind, the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) went to one of the Ansar and said: &#8220;I want to have your daughter married.&#8221; &#8220;How wonderful and blessed, O Messenger of Allah and what a delight to the eye (this would be),&#8221; replied the Ansari man with obvious joy and happiness. &#8220;I do not want her for myself,&#8221; added the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam). &#8220;Then for whom, O Messenger of Allah?&#8221; asked the man, obviously somewhat let down. &#8220;<em>For Julaybib</em>,&#8221; said the Prophet. The Ansari must have been too shocked to give his own reaction and he merely said: &#8220;I will consult with her mother.&#8221; And off he went to his wife. &#8220;The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wants to have your daughter married,&#8221; he said to her. She too was thrilled. &#8220;What a wonderful idea and what a delight to the eye (this would be),&#8221; she said. &#8220;He does not want to marry her himself but he wants to marry her to Julaybib,&#8221; he added. She was flabbergasted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To Julaybib! No, never to Julaybib! No, by Allah, we shall not marry (her) to him,&#8221; she protested. As the Ansari was about to return to the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to inform him of what his wife had said, the daughter who had heard her mother&#8217;s protestations, asked: &#8220;Who has asked you to marry me?&#8221; Her mother told her of the Prophet&#8217;s request for her hand in marriage to Julaybib. When she heard that the request had come from the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and that her mother was absolutely opposed to the idea, she was greatly perturbed and said: &#8220;Do you refuse the request of the Messenger of Allah? Send me to him for he shall certainly not bring ruin to me.&#8221; This was the reply of a truly great person who had a clear understanding of what was required of her as a Muslim. What greater satisfaction and fulfillment can a Muslim find than in responding willingly to the requests and commands of the Messenger of Allah! No doubt, this companion of the Prophet, whose name we do not even know had heard the verse of the Quran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.&#8221;</span> (The Qur&#8217;an, Surah al-Ahzab, 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse was revealed in connection with the marriage of Zaynab bint Jahsh and Zayd ibn al-Harithah which was arranged by the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to show the egalitarian spirit of Islam. Zaynab at first was highly offended at the thought of marrying Zayd a former slave and refused to do so. The Prophet prevailed upon them both and they were married. The marriage however ended in divorce and Zaynab was eventually married to the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) himself. It is said that the Ansari girl read the verse to her parents and said: &#8220;I am satisfied and submit myself to whatever the Messenger of Allah deems good for me.&#8221; The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) heard of her reaction and prayed for her: &#8220;<strong>O Lord, bestow good on her in abundance and make not her life one of toil and trouble</strong>.&#8221; Among the Ansaar, it is said that there was not a more eligible bride than she. She was married by the Prophet to Julaybib and they lived together until he was killed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how was Julaybib killed? He went on an expedition with the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam), peace be upon him, and an encounter with some mushrikin (polytheists) ensued. When the battle was over, the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) asked his companions: &#8220;Have you lost anyone?&#8221; They replied giving the names of their relatives or close friends who were killed. He put the same questions to other companions and they also named the ones they had lost in the battle. Another group answered that they had lost no close relatives whereupon the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;<em>But I have lost Julaybib. Search for him in the battlefield.</em>&#8221; They searched and found him beside seven mushrikin whom he had struck before meeting his end. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) stood up and went to the spot where Julaybib, his short and deformed companion, lay. He stood over him and said: &#8220;<strong>He killed seven and then was killed? This (man) is of me and I am of him</strong>.&#8221; He repeated this two or three times. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) then took him in his arms and it is said that he had no better bed besides the forearms of the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) then dug for him a grave and himself placed him in it. He did not wash him for martyrs and not washed before burial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Julaybib and his wife are not usually among the Companions of the Prophet whose deeds are sung and whose exploits are recounted with reverence and admiration as they should be. But in the meagre facts that are known about them and which have here been recounted we see how humble human beings were given hope and dignity by the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) where once they was only despair and self-debasement. The attitude of the unknown and unnamed Ansari girl who readily agreed to be the wife of a physically unattractive man was an attitude which reflected a profound understanding of Islam. It reflected on her path the effacement of personal desires and preferences even when she could have counted on the support of her parents. It reflected on her part a total disregard for social pressures. It reflected above all a ready and implicit confidence in the wisdom and authority of the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) in submitting herself to whatever he deemed good. This is the attitude of the true believer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Julaybib, there is the example of a person who was almost regarded as a social outcast because of his appearance. Given help, confidence and encouragement by the noble Prophet, he was able to perform acts of courage and make the supreme sacrifice and deserve the commendation of the Prophet: &#8220;He is of me and I am of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Transcribed from: Da&#8217;wah Publications, Issue #7, July 2008</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahih Muslim Book 031, Number 6045:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Barza reported that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) was there in a battlefield that Allah conferred upon him the spoils of war. He said to his Companions: Is anyone missing amongst you? They said: So and so and so. He again said: Is there anyone missing amongst you? They said: So and so and so. He then said: Is there anyone missing amongst you? They said: No. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: But I am missing Julaibib. They (his Companions) searched him amongst those who had been killed and they found him by the side of seven (dead bodies) whom he had killed and he had been killed (by the oppoments). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came there and stood (by his side) and said: He killed seven (persons). Then (his opponents) killed him. He is mine and I am his. He then placed him upon his hands and there was none else to lift but Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Then the grave was dug for him and he was placed in the grave and no mention is made of a bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The following is from Tafseer Ibn Kathir </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. Surah Al-Ahzab</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Barzah Al-Aslami said: &#8220;Julaybib was a man who used to enter upon women and joke with them. I said to my wife, `Do not let Julaybib enter upon you, for if he enters upon you I shall do such and such.&#8217; If any of the Ansar had a single female relative, they would not arrange a marriage for her until they found out whether the Prophet wanted to marry her or not. The Prophet said to one of the Ansar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«زَوِّجْنِي ابْنَتَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Give me your daughter for marriage.) He said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah, it would be an honor and a blessing.&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنِّي لَسْتُ أُرِيدُهَا لِنَفْسِي»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I do not want her for myself.) He said, `Then for whom, O Messenger of Allah&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِجُلَيْبِيب»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For Julaybib.) He said, `O Messenger of Allah, let me consult her mother.&#8217; So he went to the girl&#8217;s mother and said, `The Messenger of Allah is proposing marriage for your daughter.&#8217; She said, `Yes, it would be a pleasure.&#8217; He said, `He is not proposing to marry her himself, he is proposing on behalf of Julaybib.&#8217; She said, `What! Julaybib No, by Allah, we will not marry her to him.&#8217; When he wanted to get up and go to the Messenger of Allah to tell him what the girl&#8217;s mother had said, the girl asked, `Who is asking for my hand&#8217; So her mother told her, and she said, `Are you refusing to follow the command of the Messenger of Allah Follow his command, for I will not come to any harm.&#8217; So her father went to the Messenger of Allah and said, `Deal with her as you wish.&#8217; So he married her to Julaybib. Then the Messenger of Allah went out on one of his military campaigns, and after Allah had granted him victory, he said to his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«هَلْ تَفْقِدُونَ مِنْ أَحَد»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See whether there is anybody missing.) They said, `We have lost so-and-so, and so-and-so.&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«انْظُرُوا هَلْ تَفْقِدُونَ مِنْ أَحَد»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See if there is anybody missing.) They said, `No one.&#8217; He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَكِنَّنِي أَفْقِدُ جُلَيْبِيبًا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But I see that Julaybib is missing.) He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَاطْلُبُوهُ فِي الْقَتْلَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Go and look for him among the dead.) So they looked for him, and found him beside seven of the enemy whom he had killed before he was himself killed. They said, `O Messenger of Allah, here he is, beside seven of the enemy whom he had killed before he was himself killed.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah came and stood beside him and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«قَتَلَ سَبْعَةً وَقَتَلُوهُ، هَذَا مِنِّي وَأَنَا مِنْه»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He killed seven before he was himself killed. He belongs to me and I belong to him.) He said this two or three times, then the Messenger of Allah carried him in his arms and held him while his grave was dug, then he placed him in his grave. It was not mentioned that he washed him, may Allah be pleased with him.&#8221; Thabit, may Allah be pleased with him, said: &#8220;There was no widow among the Ansar who was more sought after for marriage than that girl.&#8221; Ishaq bin `Abdullah bin Abi Talhah asked Thabit, &#8220;Do you know how the Messenger of Allah prayed for that girl&#8221; He told him: &#8220;He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«اللَّهُمَّ صُبَّ عَلَيْهَا الْخَيْرَ صَبًّا وَلَا تَجْعَلْ عَيْشَهَا كَدًّا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah, pour blessings upon her and do not make her life hard.) And this is how it was; there was no widow among the Ansar who was more sought after for marriage than her.&#8221; This is how it was recorded by Imam Ahmad, in full.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> : Tafsir Ibn Kathir  (Surah Burooj) &#8211; Published by Dar-us-salam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, &#8220;I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic.&#8221; So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, &#8220;Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.&#8217; And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.&#8221;&#8217; So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, &#8220;Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better.&#8221; So, he took a stone and said, &#8220;O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).&#8221; Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, &#8220;O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.&#8221;The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, &#8220;All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you.&#8221; So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, &#8220;Who gave you back your sight&#8221;The courtier replied, &#8220;My Lord.&#8221; The king then said, &#8220;I did&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;No, my Lord and your Lord &#8211; Allah&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Do you have another Lord beside me&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah.&#8221; The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, &#8220;O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases&#8221;He said, &#8221; I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Me&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;Do you have another Lord besides me&#8221;The boy answered, &#8221; My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221; So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, &#8220;Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.&#8221; They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, &#8221; O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish.&#8221; So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, &#8221; What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Allah saved me from them.&#8221; So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, &#8220;If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him.&#8221; So, they took him out to sea and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish.&#8221; So they were all drowned in the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, &#8220;What did your companions do&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;Allah, saved me from them.&#8221; Then he said to the king, &#8220;You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;And what is that&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8217; If you do this, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8221; The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, &#8220;We believe in the Lord of the boy!&#8221; Then it was said to the king, &#8220;Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).&#8221;So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, &#8220;Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.&#8221; They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her,&#8221;Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, &#8220;Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.)</span> (85:4-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah &#8212; that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir &#8211; Dar-us-salam &#8211; (Al-­Qasas, 76-84)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(76. Verily, Qarun was of Musa&#8217;s people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: &#8220;Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.&#8221;) (77. &#8220;But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world; and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Qarun and His People&#8217;s exhortation</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded that Ibn `Abbas said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ قَـرُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Qarun was of Musa&#8217;s people,) &#8220;He was the son of his paternal uncle.&#8221; This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal, Sammak bin Harb, Qatadah, Malik bin Dinar, Ibn Jurayj and others; they all said that he was the cousin of Musa, peace be upon him. Ibn Jurayj said: &#8220;He was Qarun bin Yashar bin Qahith, and Musa was the son of `Imran bin Qahith.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَءَاتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُوزِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We gave him of the treasures,) meaning, of wealth;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَآ إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوأُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُوْلِى الْقُوَّةِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men.) Groups of strong men would not have been able to carry them because they were so many. Al-A`mash narrated from Khaythamah, &#8220;The keys of Qarun&#8217;s treasure were made of leather, each key like a finger, and each key was for a separate storeroom. When he rode anywhere, the keys would be carried on sixty mules with white blazes on their foreheads and white feet.&#8221; Other views were also given, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لاَ تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Remember when his people said to him: &#8220;Do not exult. Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.&#8221;) means, the righteous ones among his people exhorted him. By way of sincere advice and guidance, they said: &#8220;Do not exult in what you have,&#8221; meaning, `do not be arrogant and proud of your wealth.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah likes not those who exult.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means, those who rejoice and gloat.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;It means those who are insolent and reckless, and do not thank Allah for what He has given them.&#8221; His saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَابْتَغِ فِيمَآ ءَاتَاكَ اللَّهُ الدَّارَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But seek, with that which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) means, `use this great wealth and immense blessing Allah has given you to worship your Lord and draw closer to Him by doing a variety of good deeds which will earn you reward in this world and the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world;) `That which Allah has permitted of food, drink, clothing, dwelling places and women. Your Lord has rights over you, your self has rights over you, your family has rights over you, and your visitors have rights over you. So give each of them their due.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَأَحْسِن كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and be generous as Allah has been generous to you, ) `Be generous to His creatures, as He has been generous to you.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ تَبْغِ الْفَسَادَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and seek not mischief in the land.) meaning: `do not let your aim be to spread corruption on earth and do harm to Allah&#8217;s creation.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah likes not the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً وَلاَ يُسْأَلُ عَن ذُنُوبِهِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(78. He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221; Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected But the criminals will not be questioned of their sins.)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us how Qarun responded to the exhortations of his people when they sought to guide him</h2>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221;) meaning, `I have no need of your advice; Allah has only given me this wealth because He knows that I deserve it and because He loves me. &#8216; In other words: `He has given it to me because He knows that I am fit for this.&#8217; This is like the Ayat:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَـهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When harm touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We have changed it into a favor from Us, he says: &#8220;Only because of knowledge I obtained it.&#8221;) (39:49) An alternative interpretation of this Ayah says that the meaning is: &#8220;Only because of what Allah knows about me did I obtain this favor.&#8221; This is like His saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَـذَا لِى﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: &#8220;This is from me.&#8221;) (41:50) meaning, &#8220;I deserved it.&#8221; Imam `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam explained this Ayah very well. Concerning the phrase,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(He said: &#8220;This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.&#8221;) He said: &#8220;Were it not for the fact that Allah is pleased with me and knows my virtue, He would not have given me this wealth.&#8221; And He said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected) This is what those who have little knowledge say when they see a person whom Allah has granted a lot of wealth; they say that if he did not deserve it, Allah would not have given it to him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(79. So, he went forth before his people in his finery. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: &#8220;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8221;) (80. But those who had been given knowledge said: &#8220;Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except the patient.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">How Qarun went forth in His Finery, and His People&#8217;s Comments</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us how Qarun went forth one day before his people with his magnificent regalia; wearing his fine clothes, accompanied by his fine horses, his servants and retinue. When those whose desires and inclinations were for the world saw his adornments and splendor, they wished that they could have the same as he had been given, and said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.) meaning, `he is very lucky and has a great share in this world.&#8217; When the people of beneficial knowledge heard this, they said to them:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds,) `Allah&#8217;s reward to His believing, righteous servants in the Hereafter is better than what you see,&#8217; as is reported in the authentic Hadith:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ وَاقْرَءُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has prepared for His righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and the heart of a human cannot comprehend. Recite, if you wish: (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.)) (32:17).</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ الصَّـبِرُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and this none shall attain except the patient.) As-Suddi said: &#8220;None shall reach Paradise except for the patient&#8221; &#8212; as if this were the completion of the statement made by the people of knowledge. Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;This applies only to those who patiently forsake the love of this world, seeking the Hereafter. It is as if this is part of what the people of knowledge said, but it is made part of the Words of Allah, stating this fact.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿فَخَسَفْنَا بِهِ وَبِدَارِهِ الاٌّرْضَ فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنتَصِرِينَ &#8211; وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِالاٌّمْسِ يَقُولُونَ وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ لَوْلا أَن مَّنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(81. So, We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) (82. And those who desired his position the day before, began to say: &#8220;Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants. Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">How Qarun and His Dwelling Place were swallowed up by the Earth</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After telling us about Qarun&#8217;s conceit and pride in his adornments, and how he was arrogant towards his people and transgressed against them, Allah then tells us how he and his dwelling place were swallowed up by the earth. This was also reported in the Sahih by Al-Bukhari from Salim, who said that his father told him that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ يَجُرُّ إِزَارَهُ إِذْ خُسِفَ بِهِ، فَهُوَ يَتَجَلْجَلُ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(While a man was dragging his lower garment, he was swallowed up and he will remain sinking down into the earth until the Day of Resurrection.) He also recorded something similar from Salim from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet . Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ فِيمَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ خَرَجَ فِي بُرْدَيْنِ أَخْضَرَيْنِ يَخْتَالُ فِيهِمَا، أَمَرَ اللهُ الْأَرْضَ فَأَخَذَتْهُ، فَإِنَّهُ لَيَتَجَلْجَلُ فِيهَا إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When a man among the people who came before you went out wearing two green garments, walking proudly and arrogantly, Allah commanded the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking down into it until the Day of Resurrection.) This version was recorded only by Ahmad, and its chain of narration is Hasan (sound).</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنتَصِرِينَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) means, his wealth, group, servants and retinue were of no avail to him; they could not protect him from the wrath and vengeance of Allah. Nor could he help himself or save himself. There was no one to help him, neither himself nor anybody else.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">His People learned a Lesson from Him being swallowed up</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِالاٌّمْسِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who had desired his position the day before,) means, those witnessed him with his finery and said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿قَالَ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا يلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ قَـرُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: &#8220;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8221;) When he was swallowed up in the earth, they began to say:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants.) Wealth does not indicate that Allah is pleased with its owner, for Allah gives and withholds, allows times of difficulty and times of ease, raises and lowers, His is the most complete wisdom and most convincing proof. According to a Hadith narrated by Ibn Mas`ud,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«إِنَّ اللهَ قَسَمَ بَيْنَكُمْ أَخْلَاقَكُمْ كَمَا قَسَمَ أَرْزَاقَكُمْ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ يُعْطِي الْمَالَ مَنْ يُحِبُّ وَمَنْ لَا يُحِبُّ، وَلَا يُعْطِي الْإِيمَانَ إِلَّا مَنْ يُحِب»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has alloted character among you just as He has alloted your provision. Allah gives wealth to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He gives Faith only to those whom He loves.)</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿لَوْلا أَن مَّنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up!) meaning, `were it not for the kindness and grace of Allah towards us, we could have been swallowed up by the earth just as he was swallowed up, because we wanted to be like him.&#8217;</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.) He was a disbeliever, and the disbelievers will never be successful before Allah in this world or in the Hereafter.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ ﴾</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(83. That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) (84. Whosoever brings good, he shall have the better thereof; and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.)</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Blessings of the Hereafter for the humble Believers</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He has made the home of the Hereafter, and its eternal delights which will never change or fade away, for His believing, humble servants who do not rebel against the truth with pride and oppression in the land. They do not exalt themselves above the creatures of Allah, arrogantly oppressing them and spreading corruption among them. `Ikrimah said that this phrase referred to haughtiness and arrogance. Ibn Jurayj said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land) &#8220;Arrogance and tyranny,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَلاَ فَسَاداً﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor cause corruption) committing sins.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ali said, &#8220;If a man wants the straps of his sandals to be better than the straps of his companion&#8217;s sandals, then he is one of those referred to in the Ayah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاٌّخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This is understood to mean that if his intention is to show off and appear better than others, then that is to be condemned, as it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«إِنَّهُ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنْ تَوَاضَعُوا حَتَّى لَا يَفْخَرَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَدٍ وَلَا يَبْغِي أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَد»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It has been revealed to me that you should be humble to the extent that none of you boasts to others or mistreats others. ) But if a person simply likes to look good, then there is nothing wrong with that. It was recorded that a man said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good &#8212; is this a kind of arrogance&#8221; The Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">«لَا، إِنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَال»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty&#8230;) And Allah says:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whosoever brings good,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(he shall have the better thereof;) meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant &#8212; how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.) This is like the Ayah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic">﴿وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) &#8220;Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do&#8221;) (27: 90). This is the position of generosity and justice.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic"><a name="1"></a>﴿إِنَّ الَّذِى فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ قُل رَّبِّى أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِالْهُدَى وَمَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ &#8211;<a name="2"></a> وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُو أَن يُلْقَى إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبُ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ ظَهيراً لِّلْكَـفِرِينَ &#8211; وَلاَ يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ وَادْعُ إِلَى رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ &#8211; وَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴾</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated Anas (RadiAllaahu Anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam once climbed the mountain of Uhud with Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman radhiallahu `anhum. The mountain shook with them. The Prophet said (to the mountain), &#8220;Be firm, O Uhud! For on you there are no more than a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Sahih Bukhari Companions of the Prophet [VOL 5: Hadith No. 1-119] )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad from Anas, radi Allahu anhu, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were sitting in the presence of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam one day and he said, &#8216;A person is about to arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person from the Ansar arrived, his beard dripping with water from wudoo and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave us the salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then next day the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said words of similar import and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam again said words of similar import and again this person appeared in the same condition, so when Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam left, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-Aas followed this person and said, &#8216;Indeed I have abused my father and I swear that I would not go to him for three days so if you would let me stay with you until those three days expire, I would do so.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas continued saying, &#8220;So &#8216;Abdullah told us that he spent three nights with this person yet he did not see him stand for the night prayer at all. All he did was <strong>when he turned sides on his bed he would mention Allah and make takbeer and would do this until he stood for fajr prayer</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;<strong>Except that I never hear him speak except good</strong>&#8216;. So when the three days were over I was eager to make little of his actions. I said, &#8216;O servant of Allah there was no hatred or disassociation between my father and me but I heard Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam saying on three occasions, &#8220;A person is about to arrive who is from the people of Paradise,&#8221; and you arrived on those three occasions, so I wished to stay with you so that I may look at your actions and emulate them. But I have not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so what is it that has reached you to make Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam say what he said?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;It is nothing more than what you have seen, except that <strong>I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;This is that which has reached you and is something that we cannot endure.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This hadith is authentic and classified as hassan. It is narrated in Musnad Imam Ahmed, and Albazar as well as others in many different chains.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated <strong>Abu Huraira</strong>, that he heard Rasulullah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah willed to test three who were a leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8220;What thing do you like most?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8221; The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin. The angel asked him, &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Camels (or cows).&#8221; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said (to him), &#8220;May Allah bless you in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8220;What thing do you like most?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8221; The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Cows.&#8221; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8220;May Allah bless you in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He said, &#8220;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8221; The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him, &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Sheep.&#8221; The angel gave him a pregnant sheep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, &#8220;I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).&#8221; The angel said, &#8220;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all this property)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my fore-fathers.&#8221; The angel said, &#8220;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8220;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, &#8220;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No doubt, I was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8221; The angel replied, &#8220;Keep your property with you. You (i.e., the three men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas radhiallahu `anhu:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the battle of Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Uhud, when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologise to You for what these (i.e., his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e., the pagans) have done.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he advanced and Sa`d bin Mu`adh met him. He said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d bin Mu`adh! By the Lord of An-Nadhr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, Sa`d said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e., Anas bin An-Nadhr) did. <strong>We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to think that the following verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ahzab 33:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Nararted Abu Jamra: Ibn `Abbas radhiallahu `anhu said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of Abu Dharr&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Abu Dharr said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Makkah claiming to be a Prophet. I said to my brother, &#8216;Go talk to that man and talk to him and bring me his news.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this information.&#8217; So, I took a a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Makkah. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I kept on drinking zam zam water and staying in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then `Ali radhiallahu `anhu passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. The next morning, I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t the man recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;If you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;I will do.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;We have heard that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali said (to Abu Dharr), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said to me, &#8216;O Abu Dharr! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dharr went to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim)!&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al-`Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning, I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-`Abbas found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, that was the conversion of Abu Dharr radhiallahu `anhu to Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>~</strong><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The story of Uwais Al-Qarni was mentioned in Sahih Muslim as well as in other books. Now even though he was from the Tabi&#8217;een and did not see the Messenger [Salah Allahu Alaihi wa salam], the Messenger [Salah Allahu Alaihi wa salam] had advised &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khatab [Radiya Allahu &#8216;Anhu] that if he meets [Uwais] then he, &#8216;Umar, should ask [Uwais] to ask Allah to forgive him and to make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Asir ibn Jaabir radhiallahu `anhu narrated</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever people would come from Yemen, `Umar radhiallahu `anhu would ask them, &#8220;Is Uways Al-Qaranee amongst you?&#8221; until, one year, he met Uways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Are you Uways Al-Qaranee?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar continued, &#8220;From Muraad, then Qaran?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then asked, &#8220;Were you once afflicted with leprosy and your skin healed except for a dirham&#8217;s area?&#8221; Uways said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar finally asked, &#8220;Do you have a mother (that is alive)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah – sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam &#8211; say, &#8216;Uways ibn Aamir will come to you with the delegations from Yemen, from Muraad, then from Qaran. He was once afflicted with leprosy and his skin healed except for a dirham&#8217;s area. <strong>He has a mother, and he treats her kindly</strong>. If he was to ever swear by Allah (for something) Allah would fulfill his oath. If you can, request that he ask forgiveness for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then requested from Uways, &#8220;Ask forgiveness for me.&#8221; And Uways Al-Qaranee did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>~</em><strong>Sahih Muslim</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah radhiallahu `anhu has said that the Messenger of Allah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned a man of the Bani Israel saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked another to lend him a thousand dinars. The lender asked him to bring witnesses but the borrower said, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8221; The lender asked him to furnish a surety but the borrower again asserted, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8221; The lender agreed, &#8220;You are correct,&#8221; and lent him money for a specified period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The debtor went across the sea. When he had finished his work, he looked for a conveyance to take him back for the punctual repayment of his debt, but he did not find any conveyance. So he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it. He inserted in it the one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and closed the hole tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He took the piece of wood to the sea and said, &#8220;O Allah! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s surety was enough and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then demanded a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a witness. No doubt I have tried much to find a conveyance so that I might pay back his money but could not find one, so I hand this money over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went far out into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he kept looking for a conveyance to take him to the lender&#8217;s place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden, he saw a piece of wood in which was the money. He took it home to use as firewood. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after that, the debtor came with a thousand dinars and said, &#8220;By Allah! I had been trying to get a boat so I could bring you your money but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lender said, &#8220;Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So you may keep your thousand dinars and go, guided on the right path.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imams Bukhari and Muslim</strong> reported that the Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three persons of a people before you, were on a journey when they were overtaken by a storm and therefore they took shelter in a cave. A rock slipped down from the mountain and blocked the exit from cave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: &#8220;The only way for deliverance left is to beseech Allah in the name of some virtuous deed.&#8221; Thereupon one of them supplicated, &#8220;O Lord, my parents were very old, I used to offer them their nightly drink of milk before my children and the other members of the family. One day I went astray far away in search of green trees and could return only after my parent had gone to sleep. When I had milked the animals and brought their nightly drink to them, They were fast asleep, but I did not like to disturb them, nor would give any part of the milk to my children and other members of the family till after my parents had their drink. Thus, with the vessel in hand, I awaited their awakening till the flush of dawn, While the children cried out of hunger at my feet. When they woke up, they had their drink. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do relieve us of the distress wrought upon us by this rock.&#8221; Thereupon, The rock moved a little but that not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second man supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I had a cousin whom I loved her more passionately than any loves a woman. I tried to seduce her but she would have none of me, till in a season of great hardship due to famine, she approached me (for help) and I gave her one hundred and twenty Dinars on condition that she would have sexual intercourse with me. She agreed, and when we got together and I was just going to have intercourse with her, she pleaded: &#8216;Fear Allah, and do not break the seal unlawfully&#8217;; whereupon I moved away from her, despite the fact that I desired her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do move the distress in which we find ourselves.&#8221; Again the rock moved a little but not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the third supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I hired some laborers and paid them their dues, but one of them left leaving behind what was due to him. I invested it in business and the business prospered greatly.&#8221; After a time the laborer came Back and said: &#8216;O servant of Allah, hand over to me my wages.&#8217; I said to him: &#8216;All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t play joke with me, O servant of Allah.&#8217; I assured him: &#8216;I am mot joking.&#8217; So he took all of it sparing nothing. O Lord, If I did this seeking only for your pleasure, do relieve us of our distress.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rock then moved away, and all the three came out of the cave safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> and <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> )</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahih Muslim <em>Book 004, Number 1812: </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa Sulami reported: I in the state of the Ignorance (before embracing Islam) used to think that the people were in error and they were not on anything (which may be called the right path) and worshipped the idols. In the meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge) ; so I sat on my ride and went to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for him. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet) and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: <strong>Who are you?</strong> He said: <strong>I am a Prophet (of Allah)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I again said: <strong>Who is a Prophet?</strong> He said: <strong>(I am a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>What is that which you have been sent with?</strong> He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the Idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is to be associated with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>Who is with you in this (in these beliefs and practices)?</strong> He said: A free man and a slave. He (the narrator) said: Abu Bakr and Bilal were there with him among those who had embraced Islam by that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>I intend to follow you</strong>. He said: During these days you would not be able to do so. Don&#8217;t you see the (hard) condition under which I and (my) people are living? You better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to Medina. I was among my people and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came. I said (to them): How is that person getting on who has come to Medina? They said: The people are hastening to him, while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him, but they could not do so. I (on hearing It) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognise me? He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca. I said: It is so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I again said: <strong>Prophet of Allah, tell me that which Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising till it Is fully up, for when it rises it comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) till the shadow becomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, till you pray the afternoon prayer, then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of devil, and at that time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: None of you who uses water for ablution and rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it, but the sins of his face, and his mouth and his nostrils fall out. When he washes his face, as Allah has commanded him, the sins of his face fall out from the end of his beard with water. Then (when) he washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms fall out along with water from his finger-tips. And when he wipes his head, the sins of his head fall out from the points of his hair along with water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall out from his toes along with water. And if he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him and glorifies Him with what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins would depart leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the day his mother bore him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa narrated this hadith to Abu Umama, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and Abu Umama said to him: &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa, think what you are saying that such (a great reward) is given to a man at one place (only in the act of ablution and prayer). Upon this &#8216;Amr said: Abu Umama, I have grown old and my bones have become weak and I am at the door of death; what impetus is there for me to attribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I would have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on occasions more than these.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?</span></em>&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221;</span></em> He said, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</em> </span>She said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221;</span></em> and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217;</span> </em>(14.37) Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa).&#8221; </span></em>When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet further added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.&#8217;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217; complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221;</span></em> (2.127)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh began:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do you want hear this real story which took place here about a hundred years ago. (In Saudi) Tayib. This is real! This is real!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Bismilaahi Rahmaani Raheem. This story took place here about hundred years ago and it was also broadcasted on the radio stations. It is about a man call Ibn Jad&#8217;aan. He (Ibn Jad&#8217;aan) said how during Spring</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">times he used to go out. He would see good and healthy fat camels and their udders filled to the extent of almost exploding. Whenever the little offspring (i.e. the calf) came close to the mother camel, her milk would pour forth because of the great abundance of blessings and abundance of goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I (Ibn Jad&#8217;aan) looked at one of my she camels with her calf and I remembered my poor neighbour who had seven young daughters. So I said to myself, by Allah I will give this camel and her calf as Sadaqah (charity) to my neighbour &#8211; and he recited the Ayah where Allah said in (Surah Al-imraan: 92):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;By no means Shall you Attain piety righteousness unless you spend in Allah&#8217;s cause of which that you love&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the most beloved from amongst my cattle, to me, is this she-camel. So I took her along with her calf and knocked on the door of my neighbour. I told him to accept it as a gift from me. I saw his face glooming with happiness and he was unable to utter anything in response.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he benefitted from its milk and used to load wood on its back, awaiting for its offspring to grow up in order to sell them. Subsequently, he gained great good from this camel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the spring had passed, the dry summer came with its drought, and so the Bedouins began looking for water and grass. We gathered our belongings and left our places looking for water and the duhool (plural of duhul) or &#8216;holes&#8217; in the earth, situated underground leading to water traps underneath the ground. Their openings are on top of the ground, as the Bedouins know of very well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (i.e. Ibn Jad&#8217;aan) entered into one of these holes so as to bring some water to drink&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Saleh continued: &#8220;and his (Ibn Jad&#8217;aan&#8217;s) three sons were waiting for him outside the hole. However he did not return. His three sons waited for him for one, two and three days and finally became hopeless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said maybe he was stung by a snake and died or he was lost under the earth and destroyed. They (and we seek refuge in Allah from this) waited for his destruction. Why? Due to greed in order to distribute his inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they returned home and divided what he had left, amongst themselves. Then they remembered that their father (Ibn Jad&#8217;aan) gave a she-camel to their poor neighbour. They went to their neighbour and told him that it is better that he give them back the she-camel and take another camel in replace of it, otherwise they will take it by force and he will be left with nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The neighbour complained that he would report them to their father. So they informed him that he had died. He inquired as to how and where Ibn Jad&#8217;aan had died, and why they hadn&#8217;t told him. They then explained how he entered into one of these holes underground in the desert and did not come out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The neighbour said: &#8221; By Allah take me to this place and take your she-camel and do whatever you do with it and I don&#8217;t want your camel in return!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They took him and when he saw the place, he went and brought a rope, lit a candle, tied it outside the duhul (the hole) and then stepped into it crawling on his back until he reached the places whereby he could crawl and roll. Eventually the smell of moisture became closer and then all of sudden he heard the sound of a man by the water groaning and moaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went closer and closer towards this sound in the darkness putting his hand out all over until his hand fell onto the man (Ibn Jad&#8217;aan). He checked his breath and he was still breathing after one week! He pulled him out covering his eyes so as to protect him from the sunlight. He took with him some dates, moistened them in water and gave it to him to drink.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then carried him on his back and took him to his house and life gradually return to this man whilst his sons didn&#8217;t know. He then asked him: &#8220;Tell me, by Allah, one week while you were underground and you didn&#8217;t die?!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I will tell you something strange&#8230;&#8221; Ibn Jidaan explained: &#8220;&#8230;when I went down there I got lost and waves took me from all directions and I said to myself I&#8217;d better stay close to this water that I have reached. So I started to drink from it, but hunger had no mercy and water does not suffice. Then after three days hunger intensified on me and took me from all parts. While I was lying on my back I surrendered myself to Allah and put all my affairs in his hands and all of the sudden I felt the warmth of milk pouring onto my mouth. So I sat in the midst of the darkness and I saw a pot coming closer to my mouth. I drank from it until I took from what is sufficient and then it would go! This occurred three times in the day but the last two days it stopped and I didn&#8217;t know what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His neighbour then informed him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you know the reason you will be amazed! Your sons thought you had died and they came to me and took away the she-camel which Allah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta&#8217;Aala) was giving you from its milk!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim is in the shade of his Sadaqah (Charity). Allah stated in (Surah At-Talaaq: 2,3): &#8220;&#8230;and whoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to him, he will make a way for him to get out (from every difficult)&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;and he will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And who every puts his trust in Allah, then he will suffice him&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By: <strong>Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</strong> May Allah have Mercy upon him. Ameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Saheeh al Bukhaaree</strong> : Volume 5, Book 59, Number 702</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah ibn Kab bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the <strong>story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk</strong> in which he failed to take part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah had excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept silent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal for carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favour, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When fourty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said, &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah described (in the Qur&#8217;an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.<br />
The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse: &#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).&#8221; (9.117-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to the three (He did forgive also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Date Palm Tree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah radi Allahu anhu:The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday. Then an Ansari woman or man said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we make a pulpit for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar radi Allahu anhuma narrated: The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam used to stand by a stem of a date-palm tree (while delivering a sermon). When the pulpit was placed for him we heard that stem crying like a pregnant she-camel till the Prophet got down from the pulpit and placed his hand over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahadeeth are classified as <strong>mutawaatir</strong>, meaning so many sahaba narrated it that it cannot be fabricated. The different narrations show that they all witnessed it in the masjid. This is a miracle of the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam, and the narrations of the sahaba are all authentic, found in Bukhari and Muslim. This tree trunk, which seems like a lifeless being to us, is actually alive and was so affected by the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>

Extracted from the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (peace be upon him)&#8221; published by dar-us-salam.com]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mount Uhud </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas radi Allahu anhu: Allah&#8217;s Apostle sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam ascended the (mountain) of Uhud with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Uthman and it shook. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Be calm, O Uhud!&#8221; I think he stroked it with his foot and added, &#8220;There is none on you but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221; (Sahih Bukhari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam was traveling one time: &#8220;and when Uhud was within sight, he said: This is the mountain which loves us and we love it.&#8221; (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a mountain, made up of rocks and stones, yet we are made of flesh and have been given hearts that beat&#8230;do we love the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam as this mountain? Do we shake like this mountain out of love for him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Stone </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir b. Samura reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I recognise the stone in Mecca which used to pay me salutations before my advent as a Prophet and I recognise that even now. (Sahih Muslim: <em><a>Book 030, Number 5654: </a></em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How often do we salute/send salawaat on the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam? The Prophet knew this stone, and if we send salawaat on him, especially on Fridays, they will be presented to him from us.</p>

</strong>[audio https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/the-pearl-necklace-saleh-as-saleh.mp3]</p>
<p>This story is recorded in the book <strong>&#8220;Gems and Jewels&#8221;</strong> published by Dar-us-salam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qazi Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Abdul Baqi Ansari is an illustrious personality of Islamic History. He was the most pious person of his time. Even after the lapse of nine centuries, his exemplary life is a source of guidance to Muslims. His biographers tell a number of tales of his honesty and reliability but the one that affected his whole life is full of strange and unique events. He has narrated this story in his own words and it adorns the pages of history books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the middle of the 5th century Hijri, I was a student of the Holy Quran and Hadith in Makkah. During that period, I once became jobless and my means of income came to an end. I managed, somehow, to subsist for a few days but soon it became hard to obtain even two square meals. My studies were discontinued and I had to sell a few of my books to support myself. I was at the edge of starvation but my feelings of self-respect did not allow me to borrow or beg from anybody.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, I was hungry, as usual. I went to the Holy Ka&#8217;bah to pray to Almighty Allah to save me from my sad plight. On my way back, I saw a velvet cloth pouch lying near the road edge. I picked it up. It was nicely sewn and neatly tied with a silk cord. I looked around to find its owner but the road was deserted and nobody was in sight. I carried the pouch to my house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was curious to know the contents of the small bag. As I untied the cord, a very precious necklace of pearls slipped into my hand. The luster of the spotless pearls almost lit my room. The pearls of different sizes were nicely put together in a string of crimson colored silk. It was a radiant beauty and I was thrilled to hold the valuable ornament. For a moment, I altogether forgot the hungry and pitiable state in which I was. My thoughts went to the unfortunate owner who had lost the precious jewelry. He must be unhappy and very worried due to his great loss. The course of action which I instantly decided on was to look for the owner and give him back his necklace to relieve him of this mental suffering. It never came to my mind to keep it wrongfully in my possession. So I set out to search for him. Leaving the bag behind, I went straight to the place were it was found.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of excited men were standing there and were busy in anxious conversation. I went close to them. Their topic of discussion was the missing pouch of pearls. An old man whose nobility and magnanimity was evident from his imposing personality, was standing amidst them. He was explaining the loss of his pearls to the attentive audience and was announcing a reward of five hundred gold coins to the person who could help him in recovering the lost necklace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I listened to his account of the loss very carefully. When I was sure of his ownership, I held his hand gently and requested him to come along with me. He looked at me very hopefully and without asking any questions, he followed me. On the way back to my house, I was delightfully thinking that a handsome amount of five hundred dinars would be mind after a short while. The very thought of getting a reward of that much money was very pleasing. I was wondering whether my miseries would be over. I would no longer be a hungry or poor person. With such happy ideas in my mind, I entered my house and also invited the old man to come in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we sat down, I asked my perplexed guest about some marks of identification of his lost bad, so that his ownership could be established beyond doubt. He readily explained the shape and color of the pouch. He told me about its contents and gave an exact count of the pearls. He even described the tying cord. It convincingly proved that he was the rightful owner of the bad and the necklace of pearls. I silently rose and brought out the necklace pouch. As he saw it, his gloomy expression at once changed. His shining eyes beamed with joy and he looked at me with sincere gratefulness. His pleasant glance of thanks impressed me, and my own mode of thinking suddenly changed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A little earlier, I was enjoying the idea of getting a good reward but now my mind was reasoning as to what I had actually done to deserve it. It was by sheer chance that the bag had came into my possession. I had exerted no efforts to obtain it. Therefore, why did I expect to get a reward for returning it to its rightful owner? But I was actually in dire need of money. My poverty and the grim realities of life were looking me in the face. Why shouldn&#8217;t I accept the reward? It was absolutely legitimate and surely there was no harm in taking it. A painful conflict of indecision was going on within me and I was in an uneasy state of double mindedness.<br />
The noble old man was looking at the necklace again and again as to assure himself of its recovery. He then looked at me and said, &#8220;O dear me, you are a virtuous person and I thank you from the core of my heart. I am unable to express fully my feelings o fgratittude for your act of praiseworthy conduct. Nevertheless, I offer you a purse of five hundred dinars as a humble present and request you to kindly accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then placed in front of me a purse full of gold coins. A conflicting struggle of ideas was still going on in my mind. The sight of money which was within my easy reach was very tempting but I checked myself and said, &#8220;Sir, I thank you for offering me a substantial amount as a reward but it is impossible for me to accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked my noble guest, &#8220;You justly deserve the reward because I am giving it entirely of my own free will. I gladly give it to you as a humble token of my gratitude. Please do not dishearten me by refusing it.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Sir, I cannot even think of being rude to decline your kind offer, but iti is certainly improper for me to take it without doing anything to earn it. The necklace is yours and I happened to find it only by chance. Its restoration to you does not entitle me to take anything in return. Please do not insist on me to accept what is not morally due to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was rather surprised by my firm refusal. Normally people yearn for money but I was adamantly declining it. He said, &#8220;My son! It is a virtue to be an honest person but the money is which is being offered to you is not disallowed by our faith. It is not prohibited to offer or accept such presents. Therefore, I request you to reconsider your unrealistic stand and keep that purse for the sake of my pleasure if not for anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;Sir, I do not at all intend to displease you, but the pleasure of Almighty Allah is more important to be reckoned with than your or my pleasure. If there is any good in my action, I will prefer to leave the matter to His Grace for compensation, which I do not wan tot risk for all the riches of this world. Kindly do not insist because I am determined not to accept any undue reward.&#8221; My guest collected his pouch and purse and stood much dejectedly to leave. He patted me on the back and left without a word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a week or so, I got back my previous job. My days of deprivation and hunger were over. I rejoined my classes and forgot all about the incident I my busy schedule of daily routine. I exerted all of my energy to acquire knowledge of the Holy Qur&#8217;an and Hadith. My main subject of interest was Islamic Jurisprudence. I completed my studies with a distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the recommendation of my tutor, I was offered an appointment as Qazi of Qurtaba, (Cordova) the capital city of Haspaniyah (presently known as Spain). I readily accepted the post and started to prepare myself very happily for the long journey. I took leave of my colleagues and went to the port of Jeddah to embark on the ship for my destination. I boarded a merchant ship to carry me to the land of my future hopes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first few days, the voyage was smooth and very enjoyable. Then suddenly a violent storm of severe intensity overtook us and the ship was engulfed by stormy waves. The mountain high waves tossed the ship around like a tiny toy. The masts were broken and the sails torn. A mighty wave crushed the ship and wrecked it completely. A few screams were heard and it was all over. I saw some floating boards and a few victims of the crash swimming around trying to save their lives. They were the only survivors of the hapless ship who were drifting over the ocean surface. When I recovered from the shock, I found myself clinging to a plan and moving with it at the mercy of the waves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After drifting for two days, in a semi-conscious state, the waves tossed me upon the shore. I thanked Almighty Allah for saving me from the jaws of death. I was so weak that I couldn&#8217;t move. I helplessly lay there exposed to the scorching heat of the burning rays of the sun. I crawled to the dim shadows of a thorny bush. I lost track of time and was in a state between dizziness and heavy slumber.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some time, I slightly opened my eyes and saw a few strange faces staring at me. They poured a few drops of water into my mouth and I came out of my oblivion but was still unable to speak. They made up a stretcher and carried me to a nearby town. When we approached near it, the first man-made thing which caught my eye was a towering minaret of a Masjid. I thanked Allah for being among my own brethren of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They took me to a house belonging to one of them and laid me on a comfortable bed. With proper care, feeding, and treatment, I soon regained my lost energy. I told my kind host all about myself and the mishap of the ship wreck. My host, whose name was Faleh Hasan, informed me that I was in Hodeida, a coastal town of Yemen. The tract where I was luckily found was a desolate region and was a less treaded part of the coast. Faleh Hasan and his friends noticed a few vultures circling over the area, so they went to investigate and found me there in an unconscious state. He introduced me to his friends and I expressed my heartful thanks for saving my life. Due to their loving concern, I was soon normal, both mentally and physically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I began to attend Masjid to offer my regular prayers and there I came to know many persons of nobility and of high-ranking positions. They all knew my unhappy episode through my host and treated me with understanding and respect. One of them was the aged and pious Sheikh Ahmad bin Suhail who usually led the prayers. He always greeted me with fatherly affection which touched me to the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, he was a little late to arrive to the Masjid, so the people requested me to lead the prayers. My hesitation and excuses proved to be useless before their sincere appeals. That day I performed the duties of Imam. I did my best to recite clearly the Verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an during the prayer and afterwards delivered a brief sermon on Islamic Law. Everyone seemed to be highly impressed. Sheikh Ahmad bin Suhail came forward and congratulated me on my excellent performance. I thanked him for his appreciation and encouragement. I came back to the house of my host filled with delight and self-confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But later, I had sometimes thought that I had overstayed my welcome. So after the evening prayers, I stated my intention of leaving, but my host disagreed with me. He wanted me to stay for a few more days to recoup my health fully. At night, when I was going to bed, Sheikh Ahmad bin Suhail came with a few respectable people of the town. The friends of Faleh Hasan, who were my saviors, were also with them. When the preliminary formalities of greeting each other were over and all were comfortably seated, Sheikh Ahmad turned his eyes towards me and said, &#8220;Dear Abu Bakr, I have been honored by these gentlemen to speak to you, on behalf of them, about their commendable wish. I expect, you will please assent to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was perplexed by that kind of address. So I said nervously, &#8220;Sir, you are very helpful and kind to me. I cannot disregard any of your commands or wishes. You can order me to do anything and it will be an honor for me to obey it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Dear son, we all earnestly desire you to stay here with us forever. The regular Imam of our Masjid had died last year. We still mourn his death and perhaps will do so forever. His respect is deeply rooted in our hearts. He had enlightened our lives with the torch of knowledge. We wish you to take his place and consent to be our Imam. We may not be able to offer you a better paid position than that of the Qazi in Qurtaba, but we will surely give you our love, affection, and respect.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But Sir,&#8221; I protested, &#8220;I am a fresh, inexperienced student and feel small to carry out the sacred duties of the high office of Imam.&#8221; The Sheikh said, &#8220;My son, do not underestimate yourself. We all have heard your recitiation and sermon, and are fully convinced of your ability to fulfill those responsibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I could think of any evasive answer, my host, Faleh Hasan, and his friends vehemently backed up the proposal. I was left with no other alternative but to nod in affirmative. Everybody was pleased with my decision, especially Sheikh Ahmad who thanked me and kissed my forehead. They all rose to leave and thanking me individually, departed very happy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They left me thinking how the secret hands of fate change the course of destiny in a secret manner. Circumstances secretly take such a turn that they altogether change the plans made up by man. I had cherished the hope of being a Qazi of Qurtaba and had taken steps to attain that goal, but preordained events made me an Imam of the Masjid in Hodeida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a new phase in my life began. I took charge of the imposed position and shifted to the assigned house of the Imam. I restarted the primary school that had closed due to the sad demise of the former Imam. I also commenced evening classes to impart lessons to explain the meaning of the Holy Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I completely adjusted myself to the new environment and people generally accepted me as their religious leader. I was very contented and never for a moment regretted my decision to settle there. All the people, young and old alike, were happy and respected me. The feelings of any estrangement all faded away and I became as if I was one of them for ages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, Sheikh Ahmad came to me and after enquiring about my welfare, said, &#8220;Dear Abu Bakr, your services to or townsmen are praiseworthy and beyond our expectations. I am glad that you had accepted our offer of staying with us. Now have come to you to ask one more favor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;Sir, I am at your service. Please tell me and I will comply with your order.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Dear son, a man is not perfect without his partner of life. I want you to marry and take full advantage of life. Marriage is also a sacred Sunna of our Holy Prophet. The sweet marital responsibilities are a real blessing which have been conferred onto man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8220;Sir, you have always advised me in my best interest. I take you as a father to me and in this matter also, I will follow you counsel.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said, &#8220;Your predecessor, the late Imam of this Masjid was a very close friend of mine. He had a daughter, and when he was sure of his end, he entrusted her to my protection and care. Since then she has been under my guardianship. She is a lovely and adorable girl of good manners. Allah has endowed her with physical and mental beauty. She is virtuous and is a suitable match for you. I wish to give her in marriage to you and I feel sure that it will be a marriage of true minds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had no objection to the proposal whatsoever. A few days later, the bonds of marriage united us. After the festive ceremonies were over, Sheikh Ahmad escorted her to my house that was in fact her old abode where she had lived with her late father. I looked at her and my gaze was concentrated steadily on her. I forgot to even say welcome to her. I was not only looking at her beautiful and charming face, and at her downcast eyes; but my glance was riveted upon her pretty neck, which was ornamented by precious pearls. I at once recognized that necklace. It was the same necklace that I once found on a deserted road of Makkah. I looked at her in silent and open-mouthed wonder.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Ahmad noticed my confused condition and thought that her beauty and the luster of the pearls had enchanted me. He politely said, &#8220;Dear Abu Bakr, that necklace and its wearer, both are yours now and you can take all your time to behold them. It may, perhaps, interest you to know that the necklace has a strange story of its own. Five years ago, my friend went to Makkah for pilgrimage and took that necklace with him to get it re-polished. There, he lost it. But due to the goodness of an honest young man, he recovered it intact. That commendable young man refused to sell his honesty and declined the pressing offer of a handsome reward. He left a lasting impression upon my friend who always remembered and talked about him. He once confided to me that he had a mind to go to Makkah again and ask that virtuous young man to accept the hand of his daughter, but time did not allow him to do so. Anyhow, it was destined differently. His daughter was to become your wife instead of his. The decreed decisions of fate are strange and beyond the understanding of man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An emotional storm erupted within me. The strange happenings of the fateful events which were unfolded by the hidden hands of destiny agitated me and drops of tears rolled down my cheeks; I looked towards Sheikh Ahmad through misty eyes and said, &#8220;Dear Sir, you are very right to say that insight into the unknown mysteries of fate is not possible. It would perhaps be a pleasant surprise to know that I am the same person who found the necklace and restored it to your friend. He, in return, offered me an amount of five hundred dinars. Although I was a pauper and was suffering from the agonies of hunger in those days, my conscience did not allow me to accept anything that was not my due. I pinned all my hopes and expectations of Almighty Allah for any reward. And here I am with His gracious and greatest reward of all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Ahmad was amazed and without saying a word, he held my hand and shook it was a passion. My newly wedded wife lifted her eyes and looked me full in the face. Her eyes were filled with enthusiastic love that any husband ever could desire for. Almighty Allah had bestowed upon me His favors by giving me a considerate and loving wife and nothing in life surpasses that bliss.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Assassination of ‘Umar – Part 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Note: the English version of this account is based on <strong>Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan’s translation of <em>Sahîh Al-Bukhârî</em>,</strong> with slight modifications. The notes have been compiled from classic hadîth commentaries including <em>Fath Al-Bârî</em> of Ibn Hajr, as well as points from the lectures and classes of contemporary scholars.</span></p>
<p>Narrated ‘Amr b. Maimûn:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw ‘Umar b. Al-Khattâb a few days before he was stabbed in Al-Madînah. He was standing with Hudhayfah b. Al-Yamân and ‘Uthmân b. Hunaif to whom he said, “What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. ‘Iraq) than it can bear?” They replied, “We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.” ‘Umar again said, “Check whether you have imposed on the land what it cannot bear.” They said, “No, (we haven’t).” ‘Umar added, “If Allâh should keep me alive I will let the widows of ‘Irâq need no men to support them after me.” But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed. The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him except Abdullah b. ‘Abbas. <span style="color:#008000;">Whenever Umar passed between rows, he would say, “Stand in straight lines.”</span> When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbîr. He would recite Sûrah Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak’ah so that people would have time to join the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The assassination of ‘Umar took place in 23H, following ‘Umar’s return from Hajj. He was assassinated by a Persian Majûsî (Fire Worshipper) called Abû Lu`-lu` Fayrauz, who was in the employment of Hudhayfah – Allâh be pleased with him. ‘Umar didn’t used to allow war captives to enter Al-Madînah, but Hudhayfah wrote to him requesting him to allow this worker to be hired for his skills in carpentry and metalwork. Hudhayfah believed people in Al-Medînah could benefit from his skills. Hudhayfah taxed this worker in the conventional manner, but he complained to ‘Umar about the amount. ‘Umar told him that he was not being taxed unfairly for what he was doing. This angered the Majûsî. One day, ‘Umar passed by the worker and enquired, “I have been told that you claim you can build a mill powered by wind (a windmill).” The Fire worshipper replied with a frown, “I will build you a mill that all the people will talk about.” ‘Umar turned to those who were with him and said, “The slave has given me an appointment [warning].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>‘Umar’s great concern for justice and fairness.</li>
<li>His concern that Muslim society should not be adversely influenced by unbelievers.</li>
<li>His concern and care for the wellbeing of the Muslims, especially the poor and the weak.</li>
<li>The attention given by him to the correct performance of al-salâh (prayer), and his implementation of the Sunnah of the imâm making sure the rows are straight and no gaps are left between the worshippers.</li>
<li>His assisting worshippers in getting the most out of their prayer.</li>
<li>His intelligence and insight, whereby he understood the disguised threat made to him.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Assassination of ‘Umar – Part 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he said Takbîr, I heard him say, “The dog has killed or eaten me,” when the murderer stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel came carrying a double-edged knife and stabbed everyone he passed by on the right and left, stabbing thirteen people out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself. ‘Umar took the hand of ‘Abdur-Rahmân b. ‘Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of ‘Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of ‘Umar and they were saying, “Subhân Allâh! Subhân Allâh!” ‘Abdur-Rahmân b. ‘Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, ‘Umar said, “O Ibn ‘Abbâs! Find out who attacked me.” Ibn ‘Abbâs kept on looking here and there for a short time and then came back and said, “The slave of Al-Mughîrah.” At that, ‘Umar said, “The craftsman?” Ibn ‘Abbâs replied, “Yes.” ‘Umar said, “May Allah destroy him. I only treated him well. All praises are for Allâh who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Al-Abbâs) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Al-Madînah.” Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn ‘Abbâs said to ‘Umar. “If you wish, we will do it.” He meant, “If you wish we will kill them.” ‘Umar said, “You are mistaken (for you cannot kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qiblah, and performed Hajj like yours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some narrations mention that the one who threw the cloak over the assassin was a person named Hattân Al-Tamîmî Al-Yarbû’î from the Muhâjirûn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A narration from Ibn Shihâb describes how ‘Umar bled heavily and fainted. He was carried to his house, where he remained unconscious for a while. When he awoke and saw the people around him, the first thing he said was, “Have the people prayed?” When he was told that they had, he said, “There is no place in Islâm for those who leave the prayer.” He then performed ablution and prayed, with his wound bleeding heavily.</span> This, coupled with the fact the first thing ‘Umar did was appoint an imâm in his place, all goes to show the importance and status of the salâh, as well as the nobleness of ‘Umar.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This narration also mentions that ‘Umar feared he had done some wrong to someone in the community, but when Ibn ‘Abbâs informed him it was the unbeliever who had stabbed him, and when Ibn ‘Abbâs saw everyone crying as if they had lost their own children, ‘Umar became relieved that this situation was not because of any injustice on his part. This shows the piety and taqwâ of ‘Umar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continued inshâ Allâh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">During his Caliphate, ‘Alî b. Abî Tâlib – Allah be pleased with him – saw some armor of his with a Christian. He decided to take the matter up legally, so he took the dispute to Shurayh (the Judge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî said, “This is my armor, and I have not sold it nor given it away.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shurayh said to the Christian, “What have you to say about what the Amîr of the Believers claims?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian replied, “It is my armor, although I do not regard the Amîr of the Believers to be a liar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shurayh then turned to ‘Alî, “O Amîr of the Believers, do you have any proof (of ownership)?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî laughed and said, “Shurayh is correct, I have no proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shurayh judged that the armor was the Christian’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian took it and began to walk away but then returned. He proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “As for me, I testify that this is the judgment of the Prophets – the Amîr of the Believers himself takes me to his judge and the judge rules against him! I bear witness that there is no deity deserving worship but Allâh and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. By Allâh, the armor is yours o Amîr of the Believers. I followed the army when you were on your way to the Battle of Siffîn and the armor came out of your equipment.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî said, “If you have accepted Islâm the armor is yours.” And then he put him on his horse. Al-Sha’bî (the reporter of this incident) said, “I was later informed by those who saw this man that he fought the Khawârij (alongside ‘Alî) at the battle of Nahrawân.”</p>
<p>Ibn Kathîr, <strong><em>Al-Bidâyah wa Al-Nihâyah</em></strong> Vol.8 p5.</p>
