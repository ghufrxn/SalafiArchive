<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Our Lord&#8217;s Descent</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الآخِرُ ، يَقُولُ : مَنْ يَدْعُونِي فَأَسْتَجِيبَ لَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْأَلُنِي فَأُعْطِيَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْتَغْفِرُنِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">؟ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Our Lord, the blessed and exalted, descends every night to the sky of this world when the last third of the night remains. He asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 1145) and Muslim (no. 758)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth is a proof confirming the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven, the sky of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people of knowledge said this ḥadīth has come with many different chains of narration, and the scholars have always agreed that it is one of the famous ḥadīth often mentioned by the scholars of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) says,  &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends every night to the sky of this world</strong>.&#8221; Allah’s descent is real and actual because, as we have mentioned before, anything mentioned with a pronoun that refers back to Allah, it must be attributed to him in a real, actual manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should believe in it and accept it as truth, saying just as the ḥadīth says, “<strong>Our Lord descends to the sky of this world</strong>,” to the lowest heaven closest to the earth. There are seven heavens, and Allah (عزّ وجلّ) descends at this time during the night to be near his worshippers just as he does during the afternoon on the Day of ‘Arafah (during the pilgrimage), praising and boasting to the angels about his worshippers. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>every night</strong>&#8221; it is general to include every single night of the year. &#8220;<strong>when the last third of the night remains</strong>&#8220;. In Islamic legislation, the night begins at sunset and this is unanimously agreed upon. The difference (among scholars) however comes with regards to when the night ends. Does it end with the appearance of first light or the actual rising of the sun? Apparently, the night, according to legislation, ends with the appearance of first light, and the common, “astral” night ends with sunrise. Allah asks, &#8221; “Who is calling on me…”. This is a question yet really intended as an encouragement and motivation rather than expecting an actual answer. It is like his statement (in the Qur&#8217;an):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment?</span> [Sūrah al-Ṣaf, 61:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…calling on me…</strong>” saying, “Oh Lord…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can answer him?</strong>” This is the result and reward for doing the first part – calling on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “<strong>Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him?</strong>” such as saying, “I ask You for Paradise,” or similar things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Who is asking for my forgiveness…</strong>” saying, “Oh Allah, forgive me,” or “I seek your forgiveness, Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can forgive him?</strong>” Forgiveness means to conceal one’s sins and overlook them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it should be clear to every person who reads this ḥadīth that what is meant by “<strong>descends</strong>” here is that Allah Himself descends. We do not even need to say He descends “<strong>personally</strong>” because as long as the verb is associated with Him, then He himself does it. Still, some scholars did say, “He personally descends.” They resorted to saying that, compelled to adding “personally” only because there are those people who twist the meaning of ḥadīth, claiming that what really descends is the decision and decree of Allah. Others say it is Allah’s mercy that descends, and even others say it is one of his angels that descends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these are incorrect. For one thing, Allah’s decision and decree are constantly descending, and not only during the last third of night as he ( تعالى ) says generally:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُدَبِّرُ الأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him</span>.[Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And to him the matter will return, all of it</span>.[Sūrah Hūd, 11:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their statement that it is really only the mercy of Allah that descends to the worldly sky when the last third of night remains, Allah is above such deficiencies and insults! Mercy does not descend except at that time?! Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you have of blessing, it is from Allah</span>. [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every blessing and favor is from Allah, and they are the results of his mercy; they can be witnessed at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We could then ask: What good does it do for us if mercy descends only down to the sky (and no further)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say it is really only an angel that descends, we ask: Does it make sense that an angel would say, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me for anything…”?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that these claims are distorted meanings, they are incorrect and proven so by the ḥadīth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, such people who claim these things do not know more about Allah than Allah’s messenger, they are certainly not more sincere in advising the servants of Allah than his messenger, and they are not more precise and eloquent in speech than the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people also ask: How can you say Allah descends? If He does so, then what about His being high above everything? What about His being over the throne? If He descends, this would involve movement and relocation. Also, if He descends, this would be an action that happens and anything that happens must have a cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this we say: This is baseless and pointless arguing. There is no reason not to say that Allah’s descent is real. Do you know what Allah deserves (of characteristics and descriptions) more than the companions of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions never made any of these false assumptions and conjectures. Instead they listened, they believed, they accepted, and they trusted it as absolute truth. Yet now, you people come and challenge the meanings, arguing for the sake of falsehood, asking, “How? Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say Allah descends, and we do not delve into asking, “What about his throne? Does this mean he leaves it or not?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being above, we say he descends and yet he is still high above his creation because “descent” here does not necessarily mean that he is surrounded by the lowest heaven to which he descends while the other heavens are above him. Rather, he is not contained within anything of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah actually descends in a real manner while he is actually high above in a real manner, and nothing is similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rising over the throne is an action, not a permanent, personal characteristic. We should not, as far as I am concerned, begin asking whether he leaves the throne or not. Instead, we should keep silent about it just as the companions did, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the scholars of those who follow the Sunnah take one of three positions regarding the issue of whether Allah leaves his throne during his descent. Some say he leaves the throne, others say he does not leave it, and others say we should remain silent and not delve into the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says in his <em>al-Risālah al-‘Arshiyyah</em> that Allah does not leave the throne (during his descent) because the evidence confirming he is on the throne is strong and explicit just as this ḥadīth is also a strong, explicit proof of his descent. The actions and characteristics of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) are not to be measured by those of creation. So we should leave the texts of his being on the throne confirmed as they are just as we leave the text of his descent confirmed as it is. We say he is established on his throne and yet he still descends to the sky of this world; Allah alone knows the “how” of it. Our minds are too deficient and incomplete to know everything about Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position is that Allah leaves the throne during his descent and the third position is to remain silent – in other words, not to say whether he does or does not leave his throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people more recently bring up yet another point of confusion. <strong>Since the earth is round and revolves around the sun, they ask how Allah can descend during the last third of the night when the last third is a constant time</strong>. For example, when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leaves this time, Europe and surrounding countries enter it. So is Allah constantly and forever descending?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reply, we say: First and foremost, you should simply believe and accept that Allah descends during this specific time. If you do believe in it, then there is nothing else required from you. Do not go into asking, “How?” Instead, accept that when the last third of night remains in Saudi Arabia, then Allah descends, and when it remains in America, Allah also descends. And His descent finishes when the light of morning appears in any place, respective to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, our position is that we believe and accept everything that has come to us from Allah’s messenger, Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in that Allah comes down to the sky of this world, the lowest heaven, when the last third of night remains and he asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Beneficial Points We Learn from This Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This amazing ḥadīth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah is high above creation based on the words, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah does actions by his choice and will—these are known as “action” characteristics (see footnote no. 7 of the <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/in-the-company-of-allaah-confirming-that-allaah-is-with-his-creation-shaykh-ibn-al-uthaymeen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main article</a>)—based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends…when the last third of the night remains.</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah speaks based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>He asks…</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms Allah’s kindness and generosity based on his questions, <strong>“Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should take advantage of this part of the night, asking for whatever they need from Allah, calling upon him, and asking his forgiveness as he asks, “Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?” And again, the word “Who” here is presented in the form of a question but is actually intended to motivate rather than ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should take advantage of this chance because nothing that has passed of your life is in your favor except the times you spent in obedience to Allah. Perhaps more days may pass you by, but when death comes it will be as if you were only born that minute. At that time, everything of one’s past life will mean nothing to him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>] The ḥadīth about this is recorded by Muslim (no. 1348). The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ أَنْ يُعْتِقَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ عَبْدًا مِنْ النَّارِ مِنْ يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ وَإِنَّهُ لَيَدْنُو ثُمَّ يُبَاهِي بِهِمْ الْمَلائِكَةَ ، فَيَقُولُ :  مَا </span><span style="color:#000000;"> أَرَادَ هَؤُلاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is no day on which Allah frees more servants from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. He comes near (them) and praises and boasts about them to the angels, saying, “What do these want?” (or “Anything they want!”)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, before you is a complete translation of the booklet &#8220;<strong>Qiyaamu Ramadaan</strong>&#8221; (The Night Prayer in Ramadaan) of Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the seventh edition of this book published by Dar Ibn Harm in 1997. This shows the tremendous benefit of this book and the great effect it had on the Muslim ummah, such that it underwent several printings and was spread throughout the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise was revised and updated after its initial printing. Thus the second edition contains more updated information and reference, and all subsequent editions maintained the same format as the second edition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The book&#8217;s introduction consists of a counter-refutation of those who replied to Al-Albaanee&#8217;s book <strong>Salaat at-Taraaweeh</strong>, namely Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah AI-Ansaaree. But the main core of the book contains a point-by-point discussion on the Night Prayer during Ramadaan, as well as the benefits and rulings of itikaaf. This books serves as an abridgement to Imam Al-Albaanee&#8217;s larger treatise Salaat at-Taraaweeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-night-prayer-in-ramadhan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download the PDF eBook Here</strong></a>]</p>

Abomination of Holding Conversation after &#8216;Isha&#8217; (Night) Prayer</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1746.</b> Abu Barzah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) disliked going to bed before the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer and indulging in conversation after it.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1747.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Once, towards the end of his life, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concluded the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">After one hundred years from tonight none of the people on the surface of the earth will survive</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1748.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Once the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delayed the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer till midnight. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned to us after the prayer and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">All the people slept after offering their prayers, but you who waited, will be accounted as if you were engaged in your prayer throughout the period.</span>&#8221;</p>

Excellence of Standing in Prayer at Night</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And in some parts of the night (also) perform the Salat (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur&#8217;an in the prayer) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer &#8211; Nawafil) for you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)). It may be that your Rubb will raise you to Maqam Mahmud (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection).</b></span><b>&#8221; (17:79)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Their sides forsake their beds&#8230;</b></span><b>&#8221; (32:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Rubb (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope]</b></span><b>.&#8221; (51:17)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1160.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept standing (in prayer) so long that the skin of his feet would crack. I asked him: &#8220;Why do you do this, while you have been forgiven of your former and latter sins?&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Should I not be a grateful slave of Allah</span>?&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1161.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited me and Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her)  one night and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you not observe prayer (at night)?</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1162.</b>  Salim bin `Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) reported, on the authority of his father, that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What an excellent man `Abdullah is! If only he could perform optional prayers at night.&#8221; Salim said that after this, (his father) `Abdullah slept very little at night</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1163.</b>  `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me, &#8220;Do not be like so-and-so O `Abdullah! He used to pray during the night, then stopped the practice.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1164.</b>  `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Mention was made before the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) of a man who slept throughout the night till morning. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remarked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He is a man in whose ears Satan urinated</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].n</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1165.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any one of you sleeps, Satan ties three knots at the back of his neck. He recites this incantation at every knot: `You have a long night, so sleep.&#8217; If he awakes and remembers Allah, one knot is loosened. If he performs Wudu&#8217;, the (second) knot is loosened; and if he performs prayer, (all) knots are loosened. He begins his morning in a happy and refreshed mood; otherwise, he gets up in bad spirits and sluggish state</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1166.</b>  `Abdullah bin Salam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O people, promote the greetings, feed (the poor and needy) and perform Salat when others are asleep so that you will enter Jannah safely</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1167.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best month for observing Saum (fasting) after Ramadan is Muharram, and the best Salat after the prescribed Salat is Salat at night</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1168.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Salat during the night should consist of pairs of but if you fear that morning is near, then pray one Rak`ah as Witr</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1169.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) performed the night prayer in pairs (i.e., Rak`ah) and made it odd number by observing one Rak`ah (as Witr)</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1170.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to leave off observing Saum (fasting) during a month until we thought that he would not observe Saum at all during it; and (sometimes) he would observe Saum till we began to think that he would not omit any day of that month. If one wished to see him performing Salat during the night, he could do that; and if one wished to see him sleeping at night, he could do that</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1171.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to perform eleven Rak`ah (of Tahajjud) prayers at night. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would prostrate so long as one of you might recite fifty Ayat (of the Qur&#8217;an). Thereafter, he would perform two Rak`ah before Fajr prayers and would lie down on his right side till the Mu&#8217;adhdhin would come and inform him about the time of (Fajr) prayer</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1172.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) did not observe more than eleven Rak`ah (of Tahajjud prayers), be in Ramadan or any other month. First of all he would perform four Rak`ah. Ask not about their excellence and their length. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would then perform four more Rak`ah; and do not ask about their excellence and their length. Then he would perform three Rak`ah (Witr prayer). (`Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) added) I submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Do you sleep before performing the Witr prayer?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O `Aishah! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1173.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would sleep during the early part of night and stand in Salat during the latter part</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1174.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> One night I joined the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in his (optional) Salat. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prolonged the Qiyam (standing) so much that I made up my mind to commit an act of wrong.</span> He was questioned: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">What did you intend to do?</span>&#8216;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;</span> He replied:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I intended to sit down and stop following him (in Salat)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1175.</b>  Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I performed Salat with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) one night, and he started reciting Surat Al-Baqarah. I thought that he would go in Ruku</span><span style="color:#008000;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span><span style="color:#008000;"> (bowing posture in Salat) at the end of one hundred Ayat, but he continued (reciting); and I thought that he would perhaps recite (this Surah) in the whole Rak`ah (prayer), but he continued the recitation; I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this Surah). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then started reciting Surat An-Nisa&#8217; which he followed with Surat Al-Imran. He recited leisurely. When he recited an Ayah which mentioned the tasbeeh, he would say Subhan Allah and when he recited the Ayah which tells how the Rubb is to be asked, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would then ask from Him; and when he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) recited an Ayah asking one to seek Protection Allah, he would seek Protection of Allah. Then he bowed and said, &#8220;Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim (My Rubb the Great is free from imperfection)&#8221;; his bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing, (and then on returning to the standing posture after Ruku`) he would say, &#8220;Sami&#8217; Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana lakal-hamd (Allah listens to him who praises Him. Praise be to You, Our Rubb!),&#8221; and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say, &#8220;Subhana Rabbiyal-A`la (My Rubb the Supreme is free from imperfection),&#8221; and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing (Qiyam)</span>.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1176.</b>  Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;Which Salat is the best?&#8221; He replied, &#8221;<span style="color:#0000ff;"> The best Salat is that in which Qiyam (the duration of standing) is longer</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1177.</b>  `Abdullah bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Salat which is dearest to Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud; and As-Saum (the fasting) which is dearest to Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud. He used to sleep half the night, get up to perform Salat for one-third of it, then sleep through the remaining one-sixth of it; and he used to observe Saum on alternative days</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1178.</b>  Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Every night there is a special time during which whatever a Muslim asks Allah of any good relating to this life or the Hereafter, it will be granted to him; and this moment comes every night</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1179.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you gets up at night to perform (Tahajjud) prayer, let him start Salat with two short Rak`ah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1180.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Whenever the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood for Salat at night, he would start his prayer with two brief Rak`ah</span>.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1181.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> If the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) missed his night (Tahajjud) Salat because of indisposition or the like, he would perform twelve Rak`ah during the day</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1182.</b>  `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone falls asleep and therefore fails to observe his Hizb (share) or part of it, if he observes it between the Fajr and the Zuhr prayers, it will be recorded for him as though he had observed it during the night</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1183.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah show mercy to a man who gets up during the night and performs Salat, awakens his wife to pray and if she refuses, he sprinkles water on her face (to make her get up). May Allah show mercy to a woman who gets up during the night and performs Salat, awakens her husband for the same purpose; and if he refuses, she sprinkles water on his face</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1184.</b>  Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When a man awakens his wife during the night and they both perform two Rak`ah Salat together, they are recorded among the men and women who celebrate remembrance of Allah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1185.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you dozes off while performing Salat, he should lie down till his drowsiness has gone away from him. When one of you performs Salat while dozing, he may abuse himself instead of seeking pardon (as a result of drowsiness)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1186.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When anyone of you stands up for Salat at night and finds it difficult to recite the Qur&#8217;an accurately and he is unaware of what he is reciting, he should go back to sleep</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 32:</p>
<h3 align="center">Praying at Night in Ramadaan (Taraweeh)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.032.226"></a>Volume 3, Book 32, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying regarding Ramadan, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night in it (the month of Ramadan) out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.&#8221; Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s Caliphate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Abdul Qari said, &#8220;I went out in the company of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)&#8217;. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, &#8216;Umar remarked, &#8216;What an excellent Bid&#8217;a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.&#8217; He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray (at night) in Ramadan.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he was informed by &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out in the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;How was the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in Ramadan?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He did not pray more than eleven Rakat in Ramadan or in any other month. He used to pray four Rakat &#8212;- let alone their beauty and length&#8212;-and then he would pray four &#8212;-let alone their beauty and length &#8212;-and then he would pray three Rakat (Witr).&#8221; She added, &#8220;I asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you sleep before praying the Witr?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever fasted the month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith (i.e. belief) and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stood for the prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven .&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some men amongst the companions of the Prophet were shown in their dreams that the night of Qadr was in the last seven nights of Ramadan. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It seems that all your dreams agree that (the Night of Qadr) is in the last seven nights, and whoever wants to search for it (i.e. the Night of Qadr) should search in the last seven (nights of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Sa&#8217;id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, &#8220;We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, &#8216;I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l&#8217;tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day&#8217;s period)&#8217;, and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Search for the Night of Qadr in the odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 32, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf (in the mosque) in the middle third of Ramadan and after passing the twenty nights he used to go back to his house on the 21st, and the people who were in Itikaf with him also used to go back to their houses. Once in Ramadan, in which he practiced Itikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and ordered them whatever Allah wished him to order and said, &#8220;I used to practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle 113rd but now I intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I have verily been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr) but I have forgotten it. So search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days (of this month). I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet . I saw with my own eyes the Prophet at the completion of the morning prayer leaving with his face covered with mud and water.</p>

So, the Prophet said, &#8220;I came out to inform you about the Night of Qadr but such-and-such persons were quarreling, so the news about it had been taken away; yet that might be for your own good, so search for it on the 29th, 27th and 25th (of Ramadan).</p>

<h3 align="center">Prayer at Night (Tahajjud)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.021.221"></a>Volume 2, Book 21, Number 221:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa wa&#8217;duka-l-haq, wa liqa&#8217;uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Haq wan-naru Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam, Haq, was-sa&#8217;atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, wa &#8216;Alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu faghfir li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama&#8217;a lantu, anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or la ilaha ghairuka).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for You; You are the King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the praises are for You; You are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, And to meet You is true, Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true And Hell is true And all the Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; And Muhammad is true, And the Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I surrender (my will) to You; I believe in You and depend on You. And repent to You, And with Your help I argue (with my opponents, the non-believers) And I take You as a judge (to judge between us). Please forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but you . Sufyan said that &#8216;Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, &#8216;Wala haula Wala quwata illa billah&#8217; (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 222:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.&#8221; Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet said, &#8220;Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud.&#8221; After that &#8216;Abdullah (i.e. Salim&#8217;s father) used to sleep but a little at night.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 223:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer eleven Rakat and that was his prayer. He used to prolong the prostration to such an extent that one could recite fifty verses (of the Quran) before he would lift his head. He used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the Fajr prayer and then used to lie down on his right side till the call-maker came and informed him about the prayer.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 224:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet became sick and did not get up (for Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 225:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gabriel did not come to the Prophet (for some time) and so one of the Quraish women said, &#8220;His Satan has deserted him.&#8221; So came the Divine Revelation: &#8220;By the forenoon And by the night When it is still! Your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither Forsaken you Nor hated you.&#8221; (93.1-3)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the Prophet got up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! How many afflictions Allah has revealed tonight and how many treasures have been sent down (disclosed). Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings up (for prayers), perhaps a well-dressed in this world may be naked in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet and asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you pray (at night)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us to get up He will make us get up.&#8221; When I said that, he left us without saying anything and I heard that he was hitting his thigh and saying, &#8220;But man is more quarrelsome than anything.&#8221; (18.54)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to give up a good deed, although he loved to do it, for fear that people might act on it and it might be made compulsory for them. The Prophet never prayed the Duha prayer, but I offer it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer in the Mosque and the people followed him. The next night he also offered the prayer and too many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people gathered, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning he said, &#8220;I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to you.&#8221; And that happened in the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to stand (in the prayer) or pray till both his feet or legs swelled. He was asked why (he offered such an unbearable prayer) and he said, &#8220;should I not be a thankful slave.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me, &#8220;The most beloved prayer to Allah is that of David and the most beloved fasts to Allah are those of David. He used to sleep for half of the night and then pray for one third of the night and again sleep for its sixth part and used to fast on alternate days.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha which deed was most loved by the Prophet. She said, &#8220;A deed done continuously.&#8221; I further asked, &#8220;When did he used to get up (in the night for the prayer).&#8221; She said, &#8220;He used to get up on hearing the crowing of a cock.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Zaid bin Thabit took their Suhur together. When they finished it, the Prophet stood for the (Fajr) prayer and offered it.&#8221; We asked Anas, &#8220;What was the interval between their finishing the Suhur and the starting of the morning prayer?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;It was equal to the time taken by a person in reciting fifty verses of the Quran.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-Wa il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;One night I offered the Tahajjud prayer with the Prophet and he kept on standing till an ill-thought came to me.&#8221; We said, &#8220;What was the ill-thought?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was to sit down and leave the Prophet (standing).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How is the prayer of the night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and when you apprehend the approaching dawn, offer one Raka as Witr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Aisha about the night prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she said, &#8220;It was seven, nine or eleven Rakat besides the two Rakat of the Fajr prayer (i.e. Sunna). &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes Allah&#8217;s Apostle would not fast (for so many days) that we thought that he would not fast that month and he sometimes used to fast (for so many days) that we thought he would not leave fasting through-out that month and (as regards his prayer and sleep at night), if you wanted to see him praying at night, you could see him praying and if you wanted to see him sleeping, you could see him sleeping.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Satan puts three knots at the back of the head of any of you if he is asleep. On every knot he reads and exhales the following words, &#8216;The night is long, so stay asleep.&#8217; When one wakes up and remembers Allah, one knot is undone; and when one performs ablution, the second knot is undone, and when one prays the third knot is undone and one gets up energetic with a good heart in the morning; otherwise one gets up lazy and with a mischievous heart.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-rabi&#8217; Al-Ansari,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he remembered Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, &#8220;I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;I have weak eye-sight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I will do so.&#8217; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, &#8216;Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?&#8217; I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called &#8220;Khazir&#8221; which I had prepared for him.&#8211;(&#8220;Khazir&#8221; is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the neighbors got the news that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, &#8216;What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?&#8217; One of them replied, &#8216;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t say this. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;Allah and His Apostle know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell.&#8221; Mahmud added, &#8220;I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu&#8217;aw7ya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, &#8216;I doubt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle ever said what you have said.&#8217; I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or &#8216;Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Abu Said saying four words. He said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet (saying the following narrative).&#8221; He had participated in twelve holy battles with the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not set out on a journey except for three Mosques i.e. Al-Masjid-AI-Haram, the Mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and the Mosque of Al-Aqsa, (Mosque of Jerusalem).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;One prayer in my Mosque is better than one thousand prayers in any other mosque excepting Al-Masjid-AI-Haram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) Whenever he visited Quba, for he used to visit it every Saturday. When he entered the Mosque, he disliked to leave it without offering a prayer. Ibn &#8216;Umar narrated that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit the Mosque of Quba (sometime) walking and (sometime) riding. And he (i.e. Ibn &#8216;Umar) used to say, &#8220;I do only what my companions used to do and I don&#8217;t forbid anybody to pray at any time during the day or night except that one should not intend to pray at sunrise or sunset.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Outset and end of the last third of night</b><b>  [1]<span id="This was published in Al-Da&#096;wah magazine, issue no. 1138, on 2/9/1408 A.H." class="tip"></span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: It is reported in the Hadith that <a name="Allahdescendseverynighttothe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="24854"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven in the last third of the night</span> [2].</span> When does the last third of the night begin and end?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There are Mutawatir Hadiths (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that prove that Allah descends. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, <a name="OurLorddescendstothelowest"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="13253"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night begins when He says, ‘Who calls Me to answer him? Who asks Me to give him? Who asks Me for forgiveness to forgive him?</span> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) unanimously agreed that Allah descends in a manner that befits Him and that He is not like His creation at all in any of His Attributes, as He states, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 1" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 2" target="_blank" name="All%C3%A2h-us-Samad(%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%85%D8%AF"></a>&#8220;Allâh-us-Samad (السيد الذي يصمد إليه في الحاجات) [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]</span></em>. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 3" target="_blank" name="Hebegetsnot,norwasHebegotten"></a>&#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 4" target="_blank" name="Andthereisnoneco-equalorcomparableuntoHim"></a>&#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, we must accept the Ayahs and Hadiths that speak of the Attributes of Allah as they are without <strong>Tahrif</strong> (distortion of the meaning), <strong>Ta`til</strong> (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), <strong>Takyif</strong> (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), or <strong>Tamthil</strong> (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation). At the same time, we must believe in them and believe that what is mentioned in these texts is true without likening Allah to His creation or discussing the nature of His Attributes. Rather, their view concerning His Attributes is like their view concerning His Dhat (Essence). Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah affirm the Essence of Allah without Takyif, or Tamthil, and thus, we must also affirm His Attributes without Takyif or Tamthil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The descent of Allah occurs in every country in a manner that befits Allah, because the descent of Allah is not like the descent of any of His creation. He is described as descending in the last part of the night in all parts of the world in a manner that befits His Majesty, Exalted be He.No one can know how He descends just as no one can know how His Essence is, except Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He states, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>.<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11.</span> Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74" target="_blank" name="Soputnotforwardsimilitudes"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly! Allâh knows and you know not.<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74</span></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The time of the first and last third of the night differs according to the season; if the night is nine hours long, then the time of descent begins at the onset of the seventh hour and continues until dawn. If the night is twelve hours long, then the last third begins at the beginning of the ninth hour until the break of dawn and so on, depending on how long or short the night is in each place</strong></span>.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The first question of Fatwa no. 19886   </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Q 1: <strong>is the hour that precedes the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer considered as part of the last third of the night?  </strong> </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;"> A: The hour that precedes the second Fajr (true dawn), which consists of 60 minutes, is part of the last third of the night and is considered to be the last hour of the last third of the night. This is because the <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>night begins from the sunset and lasts until the emergence of the second Fajr</strong></span>. It is authentically reported that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) descends to the worldly heaven in the last third of the night. It was related by Al-Bukhari in his &#8220;Sahih (Book of Authentic Hadith)&#8221;, vol. 2, p. 47, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Our Lord, Blessed and Exalted is He, descends every night to the heaven of the world, when only the last third of the night remains and says, &#8220;Who will supplicate Me that I may respond to him; who will ask Me that I may give him; who will beg My forgiveness that I may forgive him?&#8221; Every Muslim and Muslimah is free to benefit from the blessed times and the times when supplications are answered, to supply themselves with good righteous deeds and supplicate for whatever they like from the matters of the Din (religion) or the Duniya (this world). </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">May Allah grant us success!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
Source:Qiyaam Ramadaan (pg. 28-30)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (for al-manhaj.com)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I spoke in detail about this subject in my book <i>Salaat at-Taraaweeh</i> (pg. 101-115), so I felt that I should abridge that discussion here in order to make it easy for the reader and to remind him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Manner: </b> consists of thirteen rak&#8217;aat, which is commenced with two short rak&#8217;aat. According to the most correct opinion, these are the two rak&#8217;aat of Sunnah prayer offered after &#8216;Ishaa, or they are two specific rak&#8217;aat by which one begins the Night Prayer, as has been stated previously. Then one prays two very long rak&#8217;aat (after that). Then two more rak&#8217;aat are prayed, and then another two rak&#8217;aat are prayed. Then two more rak&#8217;aat are prayed and another set of two rak&#8217;aat are prayed. Then witr is made with one rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Manner: </b> consists of thirteen rak&#8217;aat. There are eight rak&#8217;aat within them, in which one makes <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat. Then witr is made with five rak&#8217;aat and one does not sit nor make the <i>tasleem</i> except in the fifth rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one makes <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat and then prays witr at the end with one rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one prays four rak&#8217;aat and makes one <i>tasleem</i> after the four. The he prays another four in a similar manner and ends it with three rak&#8217;aat (for witr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Would the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) remain in the sitting position after every two rak&#8217;aat, when praying a unit of four rak&#8217;aat or a unit of three rak&#8217;aat? We do not find a clear answer for this, but remaining in the sitting position (for <i>tashahhud</i>) while doing a unit of three rak&#8217;aat is not legislated (in the Religion)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one prays eight rak&#8217;aat and does not sit in any of them except for the eighth rak&#8217;ah. While sitting (in the eighth rak&#8217;ah), he makes the <i>tashahhud</i> and sends Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and then stands up again without making the <i>tasleem</i>. Then he makes witr with one rak&#8217;ah and when finished, he makes the <i>tasleem</i>. This consists of nine rak&#8217;aat. Then he prays two rak&#8217;aat after that while in the sitting position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth Manner: </b> One prays nine rak&#8217;aat, in which he does not sit except after the sixth rak&#8217;ah. Then he makes the <i>tashahhud</i> and sends Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and then stands again without making the <i>tasleem</i>. Then he makes witr with three rak&#8217;aat and when finished, he makes the <i>tasleem</i>, etc. (the rest is the same as the previous manner)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the manners in which it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) performed the Night Prayer. It is possible to add other types of manners to it, by subtracting what one wishes from each set of rak&#8217;aat until he cuts it down to one rak&#8217;ah, acting on the previously mentioned hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b> &#8220;So whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with five rak&#8217;aat, and whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with three rak&#8217;aat, and whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with one rak&#8217;ah.&#8221; </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if one wants, he can pray these five rak&#8217;aat or three rak&#8217;aat with one sitting and one <i>tasleem</i>, as is stated in the Second Manner. And if he wants, he can make <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat, as is stated in the Third Manner, and this is preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praying the set of five rak&#8217;aat or three rak&#8217;aat by sitting after every two rak&#8217;aat and not making the <i>tasleem</i>, then we did not find any authentic report that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) used to do this. The <i>asl</i> (foundation) is that it is permissible, but since the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade us from praying witr with three rak&#8217;aat indicating the reason for that by saying: <b> &#8220;And do not liken it to the Maghrib prayer.&#8221; </b> [1] So then anyone that prays the witr in three rak&#8217;aat must not liken it to the Maghrib prayer. This can be done in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Making the <i>tasleem</i> between the even and odd number rak&#8217;ah (i.e. between the second and the third rak&#8217;ah). This is what is more strong and preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. One does not sit between the even and odd number (i.e. he prays three rak&#8217;aat straight with one <i>tasleem</i>), and Allaah knows best.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Abu Dawood as-Sijistani (d. 275 A.H.) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Imam Ahmad was asked while I was listening: Should the Qayyam – meaning the Taraweeh prayer – be delayed to the last part of the night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -Rahimullaah- answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, the Sunnah of the Muslims is more beloved to me.’ [From: Masa’il Abee Dawood’ p.90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 – Al-Marwazi quotes from Imraan bin Haydar -Rahimullaah-:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sent a question to al-Hasan -Rahimullaah- and I asked him about the Isha prayer in Ramadan, should we pray it then return to our homes and sleep then return to the Masjid after wards?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He rejected that and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, Salatul- Isha then the Qayaam.’ [From ‘Qayyam al-Layl’ by al-Marwazi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘…and Taraweeh prayer is a Sunnah after the Isha prayer.’ [From: ‘Mukhtasir al-Fatawa’ by Baali p.81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Sunnah of the Taraweeh prayer is that it is prayed after the end of the Isha prayer, as is agreed upon by the Salaf and the Imams.’ [From: ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ 23/119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 – Shaykh Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- was asked:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: ‘In the last ten nights of Ramadan, they divide up the prayer, the night prayer at the first part of the night, and the last part of the night, and this has become a continuous practice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: ‘Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: ‘How would it be then if we wanted to establish the Sunnah and make it easy for the people?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: ‘They presume the like of what Umar had said, that those who delay the prayer are better. Meaning that Umar ordered Ubayy bin Ka’ab to establish the night prayer with the people after the Isha prayer, so he did so, and when Umar went out he said: ‘ This is a blessed Bida’ and those who sleep instead of it are better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner: ‘So you mean that the situation of the night prayer is the same as it was before the last ten nights?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: ‘Yes.’ [From: &#8216;Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor&#8217; Tape no. 719]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5 – Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan bin Abdullaah al-Fawzan said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the Salat-ul-Taraweehya; then this is a stressed Sunnah, and it is done straight after the Isha prayer and the optional prayers after the Isha prayer. This is what was the practice of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for delaying it, as the questioner mentions, to another time, then coming to the Masjid and praying at-Taraweehya, then this is in contrast to what was practiced. The scholars of Fiqh mention that it is done after the Isha prayer and it is the optional prayers after the Isha prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they delay it, then we do not say it is Haraam, however, it is in opposition to that which was practiced. Taraweehya is prayed in the beginning of the night, this is what was the practice.’</p>

<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And in some parts of the night (also) perform the Salat (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur&#8217;an in the prayer) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer &#8211; Nawafil) for you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)). It may be that your Rubb will raise you to Maqam Mahmud (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection).&#8221; </span>(17:79)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Their sides forsake their beds&#8230;&#8221; </span>(32:16)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Rubb (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope].&#8217;</span>&#8216; (51:17)</p>
<p>`Abdullah bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Salat which is dearest to Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud; and As-Saum (the fasting) which is dearest to Allah is that of (Prophet) Dawud. He used to sleep half the night, get up to perform Salat for one-third of it, then sleep through the remaining one-sixth of it; and he used to observe Saum on alternative days.&#8221;</span></p>
