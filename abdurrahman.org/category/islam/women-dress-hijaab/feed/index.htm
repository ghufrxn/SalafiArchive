<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of Judgment. O Allah! Have Your <em>Salat</em> (1) and <em>Salam</em> (peace) and blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and upon all of his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extraordinary consideration has been given by the Islamic Law to women&#8217;s affairs, all meant to protect her chastity, to honor her and to secure her position in life. The so called &#8220;restrictions&#8221; placed upon her regarding her dress and the display of her beauty and ornament is only to guard against all ways of corruption arising from such dazzling displays. What Islam has established is not a restriction on the freedom of women but is a firm protection for her from falling down to the lowest levels of humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the means of this protection is the HIJAB. The characteristics of the Hijab are discussed, bringing the glad tidings promised (by Allah) to those women adhering to it. We also point out the danger of dazzling displays of ornaments and beauty as well as the terrible repercussions in this life and in the hereafter for those who practice <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj </em>(display of beauty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It comes at a time when more women are throwing away their revealing clothes, and wearing the Hijab. This comes at a time when Muslim women wearing Hijab are attacked in &#8220;civilized&#8221; Europe (2)! and inFrance (3) Muslim women are prevented from wearing the head scarf / Hijab at school. These are times of trials for Muslims and particularly for Muslim women. We all have to remember the path of the Prophets: endurance, patience, holding on, and aiming high by keeping the way of Allah above everything.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"> (1) The <em>Salat</em> of Allah upon prophet Muhammad is His Praise and mentioning of the Prophet to the angels in the Most High place in Paradise</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(2) Bosnia is a testimony against the &#8220;civility&#8221; of Europe and the West. Civility stops at the word: Muslim or Islam!</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(3) The country that raises the banner of: equality, brotherhood, and freedom.!!!</span></p>
<h2><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF HIJAAB</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) AN ACT OF OBEDIENCE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is an act of obedience to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) (4) and to His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم (5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) a judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed,, Allah ordered that women must put on the Hijab (6)<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their <em>Juyubihinna</em> </span>(7)<span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah considered the dazzling display of beauty an act of ignorance:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of <em>Jahiliyeeyah</em></span>(8)<span style="color:#008000;"> (ignorance). &#8220;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">,</a> Most Glorified, says:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask the Prophet&#8217;s wives for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above Ayah (verse) does not apply only to the Prophet&#8217;s wives but to all of the believing women. Carefully read the following saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (9) (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The woman (i.e. any woman) is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em> (10)&#8221;, that is she must be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(4) <em>Subhanahu Wata&#8217;ala</em>, Most Glorified and Most High is He.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(5) صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم: <em>Salla Allahu Alaihi Wassalam</em>: May the <em>Salat</em> and Salaam (Peace) of Allah be upon His Prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(6)This is not something cultural. It is Allah&#8217;s order. Its conditions are not Arabian, Egyptian, Pakistani, Black or White American, etc. Its conditions are specified in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah to provide a protection and safeguarding of women. No one knows about what is good for men and women more than their Creator, Allah. His laws are Wise as it is the case with all of His actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(7) <em>Juyubihinna</em>: The respected scholars from <em>As-Salaf As-Saleh</em> (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(8) <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>: The days of ignorance prior to the Revelation of the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(9) No one can ignore the molestation of women that exists in the so called &#8220;open&#8221; societies. The question is: why it is happening? The answer begins to shape up when people think about the purpose behind creation. Allah created us for the single purpose of worshipping Him alone. He detailed all the ways to fulfill this purpose in the Last Revelation to all mankind, the Qur&#8217;an. In it we can find how women and men can safeguard their dignity, honor, and morality. The worship of Allah is manifested in the following of His orders. Allah orders that men and women must avoid all the roads that lead to animalistic ways of living. The Hijab is one of Allah&#8217;s commands. It is an honor and protection for women as well as a true freedom for her body from the hands and eyes of aggressors and molesters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(10) This hadeeth is narrated by Abdullah bin Masoud and collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is <em>Hassan-Ghareeb</em> i.e. good and <em>Ghareeb</em> (The <em>Ghareeb</em> is a narration by one narrator either in each level of the levels of the chain of narrators or in some levels of the chain). Also As-Suyouti hinted that it is authentic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB IS <em>IFFAH</em> (MODESTY):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made the adherence to the Hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that it is still better for them to keep their modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ ۖ وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wed-lock, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) in such a way as not to show their adornment; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things provided they do not make a display of their beauty; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about young women? Clearly they must stay modest find not display their beauty.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) THE HIJAB IS TAHARA (PURITY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had shown us the Hikma (Wisdom) behind the legislation of the Hijab:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask them (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the Hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by Hijab) and thus the prevention of <em>fitna</em> (evil actions) is very much manifested. The Hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:</p>
<h3> تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِي فِي قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ وَقُلْنَ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc.) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honorable manner.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:32)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) THE HIJAB IS A SHIELD</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah, Most High, is Ha&#8217;yeii </strong>(11)<strong>, Sit&#8217;teer </strong>(12)<strong>, He loves Haya&#8217; (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)&#8221;</strong>(13).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband&#8217;s home (to show off for unlawful purposes). has broken Allah&#8217;s shield upon her&#8221;</strong> (14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth demonstrates that depending upon the kind of action committed there will be either reward (if good) or punishment (if bad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(11) <strong>Ha&#8217;yeii</strong>: Allah is Bashful: He does not unravel the acts of disobedience by His slaves. They openly disobey Allah while they are in need of Him, yet He (being <em>Ha&#8217;yeii</em>) is ashamed of humiliating them leaving the door of repentance opened for them. If, however, they become arrogant and persist on the spread of evil, and disobedience, Allah certainly is All-Just in His infliction of punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(12) <strong>Sit&#8217;teer</strong>: Allah is <em>Sit&#8217;teer</em>: He provides means that shield against the uncovering of disobedient acts. The slaves commit acts of disobedience while Allah is providing them with many of His favors. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gives the opportunity for each one of us to return to Him in repentance and to seek His forgiveness. He loves those who do not like the spread of sin. He dislikes the Muslim who publicizes his acts of sin and disobedience. He loves the Muslim who does not unravel the sins of his brother in Islam while at the same time calls him to repent. The Hijab is something beloved by Allaah because it is a shield against the spread of evil manifested in the display of beauty to strangers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) THE HIJAB IS TAQWAH (RIGHTEOUSNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widespread forms of dresses in the world today are mostly for show off and hardly taken as a cover and shield of the woman&#8217;s body. To the believing women, however, the purpose is to safeguard their bodies and cover their private parts as a manifestation of the order of Allah. It is an act of <em>Taqwah</em> (righteousness ).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) THE HIJAB IS <em>EEMAN</em>(BELIEF OR FAITH)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not address His Words about the Hijab except to the believing women, Al-Mu&#8217;minat:</p>
<h3>وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And say (O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to the believing women.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Ayah Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَ<span style="color:#008000;">نِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span> يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the believing women&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33: 59).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;isha (<em>Radiya Allahu anha</em>)(15)) the wife of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), addressed some women from the tribe of Banu Tameem who came visiting her and had light clothes on them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If indeed you are believing women, then truly this is not the dress of the believing women, and if you are not believing women, then enjoy it.&#8221;</strong>(16)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) THE HIJAB IS <em>HAYA</em>&#8216; (BASHFULNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Each religion has a morality and the morality of Islam is haya&#8217; (bashfulness).&#8221;</strong> (17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness is from belief and belief is in Al-Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong>(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness and belief are fully associated together if one is lifted the other follows suit.&#8221;</strong> (19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mother of the believers, A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;I used to enter the room where the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and my father were later buried in without having my garment on me, saying it is only my husband and my father&#8221;. But when Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) was later buried in (the same place), I did not enter the room except that I had my garment on being shy from Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>).&#8221;(20) The Hijab fits the natural bashfulness which is a part of the nature of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(17) Related by Imam Malik in his &#8220;Mu&#8217;wata&#8221; (2: 905-Arabic). The hadeeth chain is Mursal i.e. the chain of narrators is disconnected at one point or another. For example to say: &#8220;On the authority of A, on the authority of B, on the authority of C that the Prophet said &#8220;&#8230;.&#8221; . The hadeeth is Mursal if for example C did not hear directly from the Prophet. In the case of the above hadeeth, Ibin Habban connected the chain by two ways of narrators, both of them are weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(18) collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is: &#8220;a good and authentic hadeeth&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(19) Narrated by Abdul&#8217;lah bin Umar as Related by Al-Hakim in his &#8220;Mustadrak&#8221; (1/22-Arabic) who said: &#8220;it is a good and authentic Hadeeth…..&#8221; and Al-Thahabi confirmed Al-Hakim on this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(20) As-Simt Ath&#8217;ameeen Fee Maniqib Ummahat Ul-Mu&#8217;mineen, p.91:A Book by Ibn As-Sakir that represents a collection of the great attributes of the Mothers of Believers (The wives of the Prophet-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). AlHakim reported a similar narration and said that it is &#8220;good according to the conditions of Imam Bukhari and Imam Mulslim&#8221;, noting that both Imams did not discuss the chain of narration itself. Al- Thahabi had no comment about Al-Hakim&#8217;s narration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab fits the natural feeling of <em>Gheerah</em> which is intrinsic in the straight man who does not like people to look at his wife or daughters. <em>Gheerah</em> is a driving emotion that drives the straight man to safeguard women who are related to him from strangers. The straight Muslim man has <em>Gheerah</em> for all Muslim women. Many in the world had lost this great moral aspect. In response to lust and desire men look (with desire) at other women while they do not mind that other men do the same to their wives or daughters! In &#8220;free&#8221; societies you see men sitting with strange women who are half-naked &#8220;enjoying&#8221; the scene! They introduce their wives to other strange men. Mutual looks here and there! Affairs develop and phone calls are exchanged. &#8220;Love affairs&#8221; destroys many families and children suffer most. What kind of &#8220;love&#8221; is this? The mixing of sexes and absence of Hijab kills the <em>Gheerah</em> in men. The eyes &#8220;eat up&#8221; other men and women! The inner &#8220;justification&#8221; is: since I can look they can look. It&#8217;s a &#8221; free choice&#8221;!! Few are those who feel anything when they discover their wives have &#8220;affairs&#8221;. They become numb!! No dignity ! No honor! The bottom line is that in many societies of this modern World the animalistic behaviors are becoming very apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said: &#8220;It was related to me that you women used to crowd the Kuffar (disbelieving men) from the non-Arabs in the markets; don&#8217;t you have <em>Gheerah</em>? There is no good in the one who does not have <em>Gheerah</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam considers <em>Gheerah</em> an integral part of faith .The dignity of the wife or daughter or any other Muslim woman must be highly respected and defended.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) COVERING ALL OF THE BODY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This respected author is in agreement with the position that the face and hands of the woman must be covered as he has detailed this in discussions of the Hijab issues in his book: &#8220;The Return of the Hijab, Part 3&#8221;. Some scholars say it is permissible to uncover the face and the hands of the woman as long as there is no <em>fitna</em> (infatuation) caused by her or inflicted upon her. They see that if: a) she is beautiful and beautifies her face and hands with external substances, and b) the society around her is corrupt where men do not lower their gaze, then it is prohibited for her to uncover her face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE A DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab itself must not be a display. Allah ordained it so as to cover the beauty of women and not for show off. He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And not to show of their adornment except only that which is apparent.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not logical that the Hijab itself be a source of display.(41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(41) Some women put on attractive covers on their heads. This is against the purity of the Hijab and its essence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(3) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE TRANSPARENT</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose must be achieved. In order for the Hijab to be a cover, it must not be made of transparent material making the woman covered only by name(!) while in reality she is naked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;In the latest part of my Ummah (nation of Muslims) there shall be women who would be naked in spite of being dressed, they have hair high like the humps of the <em>Bukht</em> camel, curse them, for they are cursed&#8221;</strong>(42).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added in another hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They will not enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> and would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance</strong>.(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that a woman could cause herself a grave and destructive sin if she puts on a garment that is thin and transparent and which clearly shapes her body&#8217;s features.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(42) At-Tabarani reported it and Al-Albani in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; said it is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(43) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it Saheeh as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibin Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) HIJAB MUST BE ROOMY, FLOWING AND NOT TIGHT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is a safeguard against Fitna. If tight, it will be descriptive of the woman&#8217;s body and this violates the purpose of Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Usaama Bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) dressed me with a thick Qubtyeeyah (cotton dress from Egypt) which was a gift that he received from Duhia Al-Kalbi. So I gave it to my wife to wear. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said : &#8220;What made you not to wear the Qubtyeeyah?&#8221; I said: &#8220;I dressed my wife with it. &#8221; He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &#8221; <strong>Order her to put an undergarment (or gown) under it, because I am afraid it may describe the size of her bones</strong>.(44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(44) Reported by Ad&#8217;Diya&#8217; Al-Maqdissi, Imam Ahmed, At-Tabarani, AlBaihaqi, and Ibn Sa&#8217;d. It is also reported that Al-Haithami said: &#8220;amongst the chain of narrators is Abdullah Ibn Aqeel whose narrations are good; yet according to some scholars there is Da&#8217;eef (weakness) associated with him, and that the rest of narrators are Thuqat (men of confidence regarding reporting). Ad-Dahabi said: &#8221; the level of Abdullah Ibn Aqeel&#8217;s narration is not below the rating of &#8220;good&#8221; (In Meezan AlI&#8217;tidal: Measure of Balanced (verifications); Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(5) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE PERFUMED WITH INCENSE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who perfumes herself and passes by some people that they smell her scent, then she is a Zaniyah (prostitute).&#8221;</strong>(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(45) Related by Imam Ahmed, An-Nissa&#8217;ee, and Al-Hakim who said: &#8220;it has an authentic chain of narration&#8221; and Ad-Dahabi agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(6) THE HIJAB SHOULD NOT RESEMBLE MEN&#8217;S DRESS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Women who assume the manners of men are not from us and also those of men who assume the manners of women.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-Huraira (رضي الله عنه) narrated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The prophet </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong> cursed the man who wears the dress of a woman and the woman who wears the dress of a man.&#8221;</strong> (47)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(46) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Abu Na&#8217;eem. Al-Albani authenticated it in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; (PP 66-67).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(47) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee, Imam Ahmed, Ibn Khuzayemah, Ibn Hab&#8217;ban and authenticated by the scholar Ahmed Shakir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) THE HIJAB MUST NOT RESEMBLE THE GARMENTS OF THE KUFFAR</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who takes the similitude (manner) of a certain people becomes one of them.&#8221; </strong>(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Umar (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saw me wearing two clothes dyed in saffron, whereupon he said: these are the clothes (usually worn) by the Kuffar, so do not wear them.&#8221;</strong> (50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(49) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ahmed (as part of a another hadeeth), Ibn Taymeeyah said that the hadeeth has a good chain of narration (i.e. that reported by Abu Dawoud) and that it is a &#8220;good hadeeth&#8221;; As-Suyouti said :&#8221;it is &#8220;Hassan: Good&#8221; and Ibn Hajar reported it in &#8220;<em>Fath Al-Bari</em>&#8221; and supported it with another evidence (a <em>Murssal</em>) with a good chain of narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(50) Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, hadeeth # 5173</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(8) THE HIJAB IS NOT FOR FAME!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who wears a garment designed for a worldly fame, Allah will make him wear a garment of humiliation on the Day of Resurrection then he will be set ablaze.&#8221;</strong> (51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The garment of fame is any garment a person wears to make him/her look famous. This applies whether the garment is highly precious and shows admiration to the life of this world or if it is chosen of a low quality to show lack of interest to this worldly life. The person may put on clothes with distinct colors so as to draw attention, act proudly and/or arrogantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(51) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ibn Majah, and Al-Munthari said that it is <em>hassan</em> (good) as well as Ibn Muflih. Imam As-Shawkani said: &#8220;The narrators of the chain are <em>Thuqat</em>&#8221; and Al-Alabni reported in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; p. 110 that it is <em>hassan</em> .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) WATCH FOR &#8220;CONCEALED&#8221; WAYS OF DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the various conditions about the Hijab one can clearly recognize that many of the young Muslim women are not fulfilling these conditions. They consider what they put on now, wrongly as &#8220;Hijab&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of the Islamic revival wanted to destroy it in its infancy by oppression and cruelty. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) defeated their plots and held the believing men and women steadfast in their obedience of Him (سبحانه و تعالى). The enemies of Islam realized that they should deal with the Islamic revival in a wicked way in order to sway this revival away from its course towards Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They started to spread innovated forms of &#8220;Hijab&#8221; as a &#8220;midway&#8221; solution by which the Muslim woman can &#8220;please&#8221; Allah (they claim so!) and at the same time &#8220;accommodate&#8221; her society and preserve her &#8220;beauty&#8221; and &#8220;glamour&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern &#8220;boutique&#8221; stores were declining in their trade due to the widespread use of the true Islamic Hijab. Suddenly, the markets were flooded with altered forms of <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj</em> under the name &#8216;modern/contemporary Hijab&#8217;. In the beginning this was protested and women were cautious. A group of &#8220;displaying women&#8221; who were embarrassed with the Islamic Hijab rushed towards the &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221; to &#8220;relief&#8217; themselves from the pressing social realities caused by the spread of Hijab. With time the phenomenon of &#8220;concealed display&#8221; became widespread and known as &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221;. Women friendly to this course think they are the best of girls and best of wives while in fact they are as one poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If they relate to the Hijab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong> It is the relation of an intruder</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So! O women of this kind be mindful to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and do not be deceived by those who may &#8220;bless&#8221; this action of yours and conceal their true intentions. Do not be deceived and let your response be: &#8221; I am better than those who are in a complete state of display!&#8221; There is no excuse to follow the evil. Know that the fire of Hell has different lower levels while Paradise has different higher levels. So it is proper to follow your sisters who truly adhere to the Islamic Hijab and its conditions. Aim high towards the highest levels of Al-Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Look at those who stand at lower levels than you (regarding worldly wealth) and those who stand at higher levels than you in religion (adherence to faith). for this would not make the favors (conferred upon you by Allah) insignificant (in your eyes).&#8221;</strong> (52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zohri reported (53) that Ummar Ibn Al-Khatab (رضي الله عنه) recited the saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily those who say: &#8220;Our Lord is Allah (Alone), and then they stood straight (i.e. they believed in the Oneness of Allah and worshipped none but Him (Alone) and obeyed Him for all that He ordered them) on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying); &#8220;Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of <em>Al-Jannah</em> which you have been Promised!)</span> (Qur&#8217;an 41:30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They, by Allah, followed the straight path of Allah by obeying Him and did not dodge like wolves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hassan Al Basri, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;If Shaytan (Devil) looks and finds you continuously adhering to the obedience of Allah he will seek you (i.e. check you) one time after the other. If he finds that you are still holding, he becomes weary of you and rejects you. But if you adhere one time and you do not another, then he becomes covetous: he wants to have you for himself.&#8221;</span> (54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So come on to a straight path that has no crookedness and a guidance that has no misleading ways in it, and to an honest repentance that has no disobedience in it:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And turn you all together to Allah (and beg Him) to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(52) The origin of this hadeeth was reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhari in the Book of Riqaq and Muslim in the Book of Az-Zuhd V.4, hadeeth # 7070, P 1530, and At-Tirmidhi in the Book of Qiyamah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(53) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Ibn Al-Mubarak. Imam Ahmed reported it in the Book of Az-Zuhd p. 115 and 110, respectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(54) Reported by Ibn Al-Mubarak in his book &#8220;<em>Az-Zuhd</em>&#8221; p. 7 # 20</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE HONEST MUSLIM</strong> receives the order of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and hastens to manifest his love to Islam into action and listens to and obeys the Sunnah of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He does not give attention to the lost and misleading ways of the masses of human beings who do not realize their awaiting destiny. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) negated the existence of belief in those who turn away from Him and from His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saying:</p>
<h3>وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا أُولَٰئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ</h3>
<h3>وَإِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They (hypocrites) say: &#8220;We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger (Muhammad-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and we obey&#8221;, then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers. And when they are called to Allah (i.e. His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuse to come and turn away.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 47-48 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand:</p>
<h3>إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<h3>وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ اللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَائِزُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The saying of the faithful believers when they are called to Allah (His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to judge between them is only that they say: &#8216;We hear and we obey.&#8217; And such are the successful (who will live for ever in <em>Al-Jannah</em>).&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiyyah, the daughter of Shayebah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;While we were at A&#8217;isha&#8217;s (<em>radi Allahu anha</em>) we mentioned the women of Qureish and their good favors, then A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;indeed the women of Qureish have a good favor and by Allah I have not seen better than the women of Al-Ansar in their strength of acceptance of the Book of Allah and in the belief in the Revelation: At the time when Surat An-Nur was sent down (and in it Allah says): &#8220;<strong>Let them (believing women) draw their veils over Juyubihinna</strong>.&#8221; soon their husbands turned to them reciting what Allah had sent down to them (i.e. the above Ayah), the man recites to his wife, his daughter, his sister and to every female relative. Not a single woman of them except that she took up her engraved <em>Mirt</em> (55) (wrapper) and covered her head and face in acceptance and belief in what Allah had sent down from His Book. The next morning they were behind the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), covered as if black crows were on top of their heads.&#8221; (56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is no choice but to submit the order of Allah and no hesitation should exist in following the ruling of Allah. So come for repentance, O My Muslim Sister, and watch for words like &#8220;<strong>I will repent, I will pray, I will cover with Hijab</strong>&#8220;, because delaying the repentance is a sin that you must repent from! Say as Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) said on the tongue of Moosa (May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) :</p>
<h3>عَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I HASTENED TO YOU, O MY LORD, TO PLEASE YOU&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 20:84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And say as the believing men and women said:</p>
<h3> سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;WE HEAR AND WE OBEY. (WE SEEK) YOUR FORGIVENESS, OUR LORD, AND TO YOU IS THE RETURN&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(55) With pictures of houses and dwellings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(56) Reported in The <em>Tafseer</em> of Al-Qur&#8217;an Al-Ath&#8217;eem by Ibn Katheer 5:90 (Arabic)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(1) TABARRUJ IS A DISOBEDIENCE TO ALLAH &amp; HIS MESSENGER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who disobeys Allah and his Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) can only harm himself and cannot in any way harm Allah. The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">:</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;All of my followers will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Who will refuse? &#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em>, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</strong> (21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Mu&#8217;awiyah (رضي الله عنه) gave a sermon in Humss (Syria) and mentioned that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prohibited seven things and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) named <em>Tabarruj</em> as one of them (22).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;oud (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8220;Used to dislike ten kinds of behavior and he (Abdullah) mentioned amongst them: &#8220;<strong><em>Tabarruj</em> by means of displaying beautification in an improper place</strong>.&#8221;(23). Imam As- Suyouti, may Allah&#8217;s mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;<em>Tabarruj</em> by displaying beautification is showing off to strangers and this is disliked. This is the explanation of &#8220;an improper place.&#8221; It is not so if the beautification is done for the husband<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(21) Saheeh Al-Bukhari (English-Arabic, Dar Al-Arabia, Publ. Beirut,Lebanon), V.9, hadeeth # 384, p.284</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (22) Related by Imam Ahmed in his Mussnad 4/101-Arabic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (23) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee in his &#8221; Sunan &#8220;Arabic 8/141.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(2) TABARRUJ IS A GRAVE DESTRUCTIVE SIN</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umay&#8217;mah, the daughter of Ruqay&#8217;ah came to the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to acknowledge the message of Islam and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I give my acknowledgment that you must not set partners to worship besides Allah and that you don&#8217;t steal or commit fornication and adultery, that you don&#8217;t kill your child, that you don&#8217;t commit any falsehood before your hands and between your legs, that you don&#8217;t wail, and that you don&#8217;t make <em>Tabarruj</em> like that of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em>&#8220;</strong> (24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) associated <em>Tabarruj</em> with grave destructive sins<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(24) Related by Imam Ahmed in his &#8220;<em>Mussnad</em>&#8221; 2/196. The scholar Ahmed Shaker, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said : &#8220;Its chain of narration is good&#8221;. He also said that Ibn Katheer in his &#8220;<em>Tafseer</em> :Explanation of the Qur&#8217;an 8: 327-328&#8243; mentioned this hadeeth saying, &#8220;its chain of narration is good&#8221; and he related it to At-Tirmidhi, An-Nissa&#8217;ee and Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) TABARRUJ BRINGS THE CURSE AND EXPULSION FROM THE MERCY OF ALLAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There shall be, in the latter part of my nation, women who are dressed but </strong>(in fact)<strong> naked, on their heads are humps like those of <em>Bukht</em> </strong>(one kind of camel)<strong>, curse them for they are surely cursed.&#8221;</strong>(25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(25) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;<em>Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer</em>&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it <em>Saheeh</em> as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibn Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(4) TABARRUJ IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE PEOPLE OF HELL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Of the people of Hell there are two types whom I have never seen, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with them. The second one, women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced </strong>(to wrong paths)<strong> and seduce others with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into <em>Al-Jannah</em> and they would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance.&#8221;</strong> (26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(26) Saheeh Muslim (English-Arabic, Published by Dar Al-Arabia, Beirut. Lebanon) V. 4 hadeeth # 6840 p. 1486.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) TABARRUJ IS DARKNESS ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The parable of a woman who moves with slow sweeping motion, trailing her beautified clothes, performing not for her husband, is like darkness on the Day of Judgment; she has </strong>(or comes with)<strong> no light&#8221;</strong> (27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(27) Related by Imam At-Tirmidhi in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; # 1167. Al-Albani said it is a weak hadeeth (See Al-Albani&#8217;s collection &#8220;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8221; (Collection of Weak Hadeeths) # 1800. Abu Bakr Bin Arabi, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;At-Tirmidhi related this hadeeth and said it is weak but its meaning is correct because the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; in disobedience is in fact torture and suffering……&#8221;. The meaning indicates that this type of women will come on the Day of Judgment Blackened in darkness as if she physically originated from darkness. In contrast, what appears to be difficult and painful in performance of obedient acts, is a true enjoyment because of the reward awaiting those who obey Allah and His Messenger e.g. the odor of the mouth of a fasting Muslim may not be pleasant in this world. To Allah, however, it is better than the odor of Musk because the Muslim had obeyed Allah and performed what is due upon him from fasting. Similarly the woman wearing her Hijab may be looked upon as &#8220;reactionary, old fashioned, a walking tent! etc.&#8221; She is the winner on the Day of Judgment and those who mock her put themselves on a dangerous road. They may be subjected to the wrath of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) TABARRUJ IS NIFAQ (HYPOCRISY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The best of your women is the affectionate , the fertile (in productivity), the propitious (favorable), the consultative if they fear Allah. The Most evil of your women are the <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> (those who do <em>Tabarruj</em>), the <em>Mutakhayelat</em> (who strut/swagger), and they are the hypocrite ones. Those who enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> are like the Cough Crow.&#8221;</strong> (28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Cough Crow has a red beak and red legs. This is an expression of metonymy indicating that few women enter Heaven because this kind of crow is rare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(28) Reported by Al-Baihaqi in &#8220;As-Sunan&#8221; V.7 p.82. Also reported by Abu Na&#8217;eem in &#8220;Al-Hiliyah&#8221; V. 8, p. 376 with a reference to Abdullah bin Masoud (رضي الله عنه) as the narrator. See also Al-Albani&#8217;s &#8220;Chain of Authentic Hadeeths &#8211; Arabic&#8221; # 1849 and 632.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) TABARRUJ IS DISGRACEFUL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home </strong>(to show off for an unlawful purpose)<strong>, has broken the shield between her and Allah.&#8221;</strong> (29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al- Man&#8217;nawi, may Allah have Mercy upon him, said: &#8220;The saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8216; any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home&#8217; means showing off her beauty to strangers by taking off her shield of clothes. She &#8220;has broken the shield between her and Allah&#8221; because Allah had said:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span>(Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a woman does not fear Allah and uncover her private parts then she is breaking the shield between her and Allah, Most High. And because she uncovered and dishonored herself and committed a treason with her husband, Allah will uncover her shield, she will be in a scandal&#8230; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(29) Related by Imam Ahmed and Al-Hakim in his &#8220;<em>Mustadrek</em>&#8221; (Arabic) V.4, p.288 who said it is <em>Saheeh</em> (authentic) according to the conditions of Muslim and Al-Bukhari, and Ad-Dahabi agreed as well as Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(8) TABARRUJ IS AN UNCHASTE AND DISGRACEFUL SIN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em>, All of her body is not to be shown (30). To wear the clothes that show off and shapes her body features is disgraceful and Allah  orders His slaves to stay away from disgraceful sins:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">وَإِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَا آبَاءَنَا وَاللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا<br />
قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When they commit a <em>Fahisha</em> (evil deed, going round the <em>Ka&#8217;ba</em> in naked state as in the times of <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse etc.), they say: &#8216;We found our fathers doing it and Allah has commanded us of it.&#8217; Say: &#8220;Nay, Allah never commands of <em>Fahisha</em>. Do you say of Allah what you know not?&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <em>Shaytan</em> (Satan) who orders such disgraceful sins. Allah  says:</p>
<h3><strong>الشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَاءِ</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<em>Shaytan</em> threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit sins.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 268)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijah</em> is a sinful virus that spreads disgraceful sins amongst the Muslim society. Allah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَاحِشَةُ فِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, those who like, that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you know not.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj is a leading cause for the spread of <em>Zina</em> (illegal sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) See footnote # 7.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) TABARRUJ IS A SATANIC WAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of Adam and his wife demonstrates how the enemy of Allah, Satan, was so covetous to incite them to show their private parts in order to spread evil and disgraceful sins. It also shows that the <em>Tabarruj</em> of women is a primary goal for <em>Shaytan</em> to achieve. Allah says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that Satan is the one who established the call for <em>Tabarruj</em> and show off and that he is the leader of those &#8220;leaders&#8221; who call for the &#8220;liberation of women&#8221;. Satan is the &#8220;Imam&#8221; of everyone who obeys and follows him in disobedience to Allah (The Most Merciful), especially those <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> who harm the Muslims and deceive their youth. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have not left after me any (chance) of turmoil more harmful to men than the harm done to the men because of women</strong>.(31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam forgot, made a mistake, repented and asked forgiveness from Allah and Allah the Oft-Forgiving accepted Adam&#8217;s repentance. The struggle between Adam&#8217;s off-springs and Shaytan continues. The devil still whispers to drive us , men and women, to disobey Allah and follow sin. There is no safeguard except in the return to Allah in good faith and repentance, remembering Allah, asking His help to overcome lust and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(31) Saheeh Muslim (English translation; published by Dar Al-Arabia) V. 4, hadeeth # 6603, p. 1431</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(10) TABARRUJ IS THE WAY OF JEWS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews have an important role in the destruction of nations through the <em>Fitna</em>. (seduction/temptation) of women. The spread of <em>Tabarruj</em> is an effective weapon of their widespread establishments. They have an extensive experience in this field. One should look around only to see who runs Hollywood and famous Houses of &#8220;Fashions&#8221; and &#8220;Magazines&#8221; as well as the world of advertisement!. R-rated, X-rated movies and clothes are widespread. In fact the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Watch out for this worldly life (safeguard yourselves from its temptations); avoid the allurement of women: verily, the first trial for the people of Israel was caused by women.</strong> (32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Books also testify to this fact. In the Third Chapter of Isaiah ( 16, 17):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord said: &#8220;Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with necks outstretched ogling and mincing as they go, their anklets tinkling with every step. The Lord shall cover the scalps of Zion&#8217;s daughters with scabs, and the Lord shall bare their heads.&#8221; Furthermore, &#8220;On that day the Lord will do away with the finery of the anklets, sunbursts, and crescents; the pendants, bracelets, and veils; the headdresses, bangles, cinctures, perfume boxes, and amulets; the signet rings, and the rose rings; the court dresses, wraps, cloaks, and purses; the mirrors,..&#8221; (Isaiah, 3, 18-23; The New American Bible).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) warned against mimicking the <em>Kuffar</em> (non-believers) and their ways, especially the ways of women. Many Muslims do not abide by this warning (33). This is a testimony for the prophecy of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You would tread the same path as was trodden by those before you inch by inch and step by step so that if they had entered into the hole of a <em>Dhab</em> </strong>(a desert lizard)<strong>, you would follow them in this also. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, do you mean Jews and Christians </strong>(by your words)<strong>&#8221; those before you&#8221;? he said: Who else (than those two religious groups).</strong> (34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The similarity of those women who disobey Allah and his Messenger to the Jews is very evident because their response to Allah&#8217;s commands was similar to that of the Jews:</p>
<h3>قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We have heard and disobeyed&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 93)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is unlike the response of the believing women:</p>
<h3>َقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We hear and we obey.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remember the saying of Allah:</p>
<h3>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell; what an evil destination!&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(32) Ibid, footnote # 31; Hadeeth # 6606, p.1432</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(33) It is sad to see many who dislike the Kuffar in certain ways imitate them in their ways of living thinking that their materialistic progress could not be achieved except in acting, dressing, eating, jogging, sleeping ..like them. The true Muslim, however, remembers that any progress must meet the purpose for our presence on earth: all action must be related to the worship of Allah. The Kuffar have taken some of the means which Allah had created and used it for worldly gains. We are ordered to make the means adhere to the purpose of our creation: the worship of Allah Alone and thus uses the means to defend Islam and Muslims and secure the needs of life as well. Why should some of us dress the way Allah ordered and some does not? Should we choose Allah&#8217;s way or the Kuffar way? All the success is measured by one criterion: does it meet the pleasure of Allah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(34) A famous and Saheeh hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others. The text here is as reported in Saheeh Muslim V. 4, hadeeth # 6448, p.1403</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(11) TABARRUJ IS A FILTHY JAHILYEEYAH (IGNORANCE)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described the times of ignorance as filthy and wicked and ordered us to reject it. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) described the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as :</p>
<h3>يُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He allows them as lawful <em>At-Tayyibat</em> (all i.e. good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful <em>Al-Khaba&#8217;ith</em> (all i.e. evil and unlawful as regard things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.)&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call to bring about the times of Jahilyeeyah is similar to the call for Tabarruj, both of which are wicked ways that the Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made unlawful. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! every matter of Jahilyeeyah is under my feet!&#8221;</strong> (35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj and all forms of Jahilyeeyah such as false pride and haughtiness, ill thoughts about Allah, call for falsehood, setting up rivals with Allah, ruling by other than the laws of Islam, usury, etc., are all included.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(35) Related by Abu Dawoud, At-Tirmidhi, Ibin Majah, and Ad-Darime&#8217;i and Imam Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(12) TABARRUJ IS AN ANIMAL ACT, RETARDATION (DECADENCE) AND DECLINE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To reveal and expose are natural behaviors of animals. Whenever man inclines towards such behaviors he starts his decline to a level lower than the level of manhood which Allah had bestowed upon him. Allah bestowed a natural inclination (<em>Fitrah</em>) towards covering, preservation, and safeguarding modesty. To consider the acts of display, exposition, and uncovering as acts of beauty reflects a corruption to the <em>Fitrah</em> and a degeneration in taste and a sign of decadence and decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The progress of man&#8217;s civility is linked to his/her covering of the body. The Hijab cover is fitting to the instinct of <em>Gheerah</em> which draws its strength from the soul. The so called &#8220;liberation from the chains of covering&#8221; is an instinct that draws its strength from lust which incites <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing of the sexes. The one who is satisfied with this latter instinct must sacrifice the first one in order to silence the voice of the innate <em>Gheerah</em> in his heart in return for the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; of <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing. From this we understand that the <em>Tabarruj</em> is a sign of corruption of <em>Fitrah</em>, lack of bashfulness, <em>Gheerah</em>, and insensitivity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(13) TABARRUJ IS A DOOR TO WIDESPREAD EVIL</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who carefully examines the Islamic Texts (Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah) and the lessons of history, becomes convinced about the evils of <em>Tabarruj</em> and its harm, both on religious and worldly matters especially when it is associated with the mixing of sexes. Some of its underlying consequences are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Competition amongst the Displaying Women in Showing Off their Beauty. This is seduction, and it leads to the spoiling of morality and leaves women as merchandise articles exhibited for anyone to look at.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Corruption of the Morality of Men, Especially the Youth and Those in Adolescence. It pushes them to commit various kinds of sins (36).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Destruction of Family Ties and Causing a Lack of Trust Between Family Members and the Spread of Divorce.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Commercial Abuse of Women In The World of Advertisement, Entertainment And Other Areas As Well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Doing Harm to Women by Declaring Their Ill Intentions and Evil Conscience Thus Rendering Her Venerable To Harm By The Wicked And The Insolent.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Spread of Diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn&#8217;t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result, plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong> (37)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Facilitates The Sin of <em>Zina</em> (Fornication) By The Eye.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The adultery of the eyes is the lustful look. .&#8221;</strong> (38)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tabarruj</em> Makes it Difficult to Lower The Gaze.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Justifiably Brings Down Allah&#8217;s Punishment</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishment of Allah is more severe than atomic bombs and earthquakes. Allah  says:</p>
<h3>وَإِذَا أَرَدْنَا أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا فَحَقَّ عَلَيْهَا الْقَوْلُ فَدَمَّرْنَاهَا تَدْمِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when We </span>(39)<span style="color:#008000;"> decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allah and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its Population] who are given the good things in this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When people see wrong </strong>(or evil)<strong> and they don&#8217;t change it, then it is imminent that the punishment of Allah will fall upon them.</strong> (40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(36) You may have seen teen-age kids on the corners of many streets in Europe and in North America rooming around, smoking to get high, half naked, and on drugs looking to engage in sex. Why? What happened? Many try to hide from the hard facts! The drive for lust and materialistic life became the &#8220;god&#8221; of the new generations: the Pepsi-Michael-MTV- Jackson generations. The result: AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(37) Part of a lengthy hadeeth related by Ibin Majah, Abu Na&#8217;eem, and Al- Hakim who said: &#8220;it has a good chain of narrators&#8221;. Ad-Dahabi agreed to Al-Hakim&#8217;s report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(38) Saheeh Muslim V.4, hadeeth # 6421 p. 1397</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(39) &#8220;We&#8221; Plural Pronoun: Is used to stress the Greatness and Power of Allah Who is One. It is common with Semitic languages for any Monarch to use Plural Pronoun. It is also used by members of the Royal Family in England. To Allah, however, belong the Highest and most Perfect Example.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And when you ask them (i.e. Prophet’s wives) for something, then ask them from behind a veil (Hijaab).”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the ones intended by this verse were the wives of the Prophet, the verse is general. So the wording in the verse is specific for the Prophet’s wives, while its meaning is universal for all women since the Prophet’s wives are the role-models for the believing women. Allaah explains this thoroughly in His next statement, where He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ذَلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“That is purer for your hearts and their hearts.”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered that the women be asked from behind a Hijaab. What is meant by the word Hijaab is: Anything that covers a woman whether a garment, a wall, a door or any other object that can be used to screen a woman from a man when he is talking to her or asking her about something or handing her something. All of these should be done from behind a Hijaab, i.e. from behind a screen or covering. So he should not make any contact with her while she is unscreened or lacking covering and exposed. Rather, she must be behind a screen that covers her, regardless if it is her garment, her door, a wall or so on. This is since this is “purer for your hearts and their hearts” from temptation. If women screen themselves by way of a Hijaab and the gaze of men does not fall upon them, the hearts of both the men and women will be saved from temptation and enticement. This is clearly visible in the Muslim societies that strictly adhere to the Hijaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A society that strictly adheres to the Hijaab is preserved from the corruption of morals. In fact, it is the lack of Hijaab that results in immorality and the temptation of men’s desires. Therefore Allaah’s saying: “That is purer for your hearts and their hearts” contains a basis that is universal for the whole ummah since the Hijaab consists of a purification of the hearts for both men and women in an equal manner. It blocks all the pathways that lead to the corruption of morals.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah who said the Messenger of Allaah<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-SallAllaahu alayhi wa Sallam-</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">صنفان من أهل النار لم أرهما قوم معهم سياط كأذناب البقر يضربون بها الناس ونساء كاسيات عاريات مميلات مائلات رءوسهن كأسنمة البخت المائلة لا يدخلن الجنة ولا يجدن ريحها وإن ريحها ليوجد من مسيرة كذا وكذا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of the people of the Hell-Fire who I have not seen, a people who have whips like cows’ tails with which they are hitting the people, and women who will be naked in spite of being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others, their heads will be high like a camel with humps they will not enter Paradise, nor will they find its fragrance, even though its fragrance can be found from travelling such and such distance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Imam Ahmad in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Muslim in ‘as-Saheeh’]<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama, Muhadith</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad Nasir Deen al-Albaani<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong><strong>– May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Questioner:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘What is the ruling of a woman gathering her hair above her neck at the back of the head whereby it is shaped like a ball, taking into consideration that when a woman covers herself with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the shape of her hair would be apparent from her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a mistake many women who wear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>fall into, whereby they gather their hair at the back of the head and it bulges out from the back of their head, even though they have covered it with covering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this opposes a condition from the conditions of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hijaab</em>, which I had gathered in my book ‘<em>Hijaab Al-Marata Al-Muslimah min Al-Kitab wa Sunnah</em>‘. From these conditions is that the clothing should not show the shape of the limb or anything from the woman’s body,  this is why it is not permissible for a woman to put her hair in a circular shape at the back of her head or at the side of her head whereby it bulges out, so that it appears to the one who sees her, even unintentionally that she has shaggy hair or that she has little hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that it is left hanging and not piled up/crumpled up.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the cassette collection ‘Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor’ No.386, see<a href="http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094" rel="nofollow">http://albanyimam.com/play.php?catsmktba=13094</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling of  a Woman Winding up her Hair at the Top of her head</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Allaama</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen – May Allaah have mercy upon him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Some women gather their hair in the shape of a bun at the back of the head,  does this enter into the warning mentioned in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>: ‘Women whose  heads will be like the inclined hump of a camel they will not enter Paradise’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a woman gathers her hair for when she is busy working away, then afterwards she lets it down,  then there is no harm in this, since she does not do this as an adornment or beautification but rather out of necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for gathering her hair and raising it up for the purpose of beautification, and it is facing upwards then it enters under the prohibition, due to the saying of the Prophet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>-sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their heads will be like the hump of a camel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A camel hump is at the top, and if the hair is above the neck then it does not enter under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Hadeeth</em>. However, it is warned against doing so if a woman wants to go out to the market, since if she goes out to the market and gathers her hair on her head then it will appear from within her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Abaya</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(outer garment), and it will cause attention, so she is prohibited from having this hair-style if she goes out to the market places.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the story that contains admonition and reflection in it, then it is that which is reported in the biography of &#8216;<strong>Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee</strong> in the &#8220;Thiqaat&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee, who said: &#8220;There used to be a beautiful woman in Makkah who was married. One day she looked at herself in the mirror and said to her husband: &#8216;Do you think there is anyone that can look at this face and not be enticed by it?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So she enquired: &#8216;Who?&#8217; He said: &#8221;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer.&#8217; So she said: &#8216;Grant me permission so that I may go entice him.&#8217; He said: &#8216;I give you permission.&#8217; So she went to see him and asked him for a fatwa (religious verdict). So he went with her to a part of Al-Masjid AlHaraam and sat in privacy with her. Then she uncovered her face, so that it looked like half of a moon. So he said to her: &#8216;O slave of Allaah, fear Allaah!'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of Al-Hilyah mentioned this story from &#8220;<strong>Ath-Thiqaat</strong>&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee in his biography of &#8216;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee. <strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> also mentioned it in his book on Hijaab using it as a proof for the niqaab (face-veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of benefit that we can derive from this great noble scholar&#8217;s rebuking of that woman when she uncovered her face in front of him is that: The Taabi&#8217;een used to hold that a woman uncovering herself by unveiling her face in front of male strangers was a serious crime, which needed to be changed and great efforts needed to be made to terminate it. In fact, the matter should be this way, for indeed a person that looks at a woman&#8217;s face and hands, i.e. a woman he is prohibited from looking at, is enjoying the area of the body with the greatest temptation and the most severe in danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Posted from e-Book</strong>: <a title="The Obligation of Veiling the Face and Hands – Shaykh Zayd Al-Madkhalee" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/21/the-obligation-of-veiling-the-face-and-hands-shaykh-zayd-al-madkhalee/">The Obligation of Veiling the Face and Hands</a> – Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (rahimahullaah)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Our Sh. Muhammad bin Salih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)<br />
Prepared by Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullaah)<br />
Transcribed by Br. Abu Abdullaah al-Amreeki, Jazaahullaahu Khairan, from live duroos in Paltalk&#8217;s &#8220;Understanding Islam 1&#8221; room. Text edited by sis Umm Ahmad al-Kanadiyyah, Jazaahaallaahu Khairan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah), was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“There is a phenomenon with some women, wearing short and tight dresses which expose their features and dresses without sleeves exposing the chest and back, appearing almost naked. When we advise them, they say that they do not wear such clothes except in the presence of other women and that the ‘awrah [1] of the woman in front of other women is from the navel to the knee. What is the ruling regarding this, and what is the ruling regarding wearing these types of clothes in front of mahrams [2]? May Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) reward you abundantly on behalf of the Muslims and Muslimat and magnify your reward.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (rahimahullaah) answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer for this is to say that it is authentically narrated [by Abu Huraira, radiallaahu &#8216;anhu] that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Two are the types amongst the denizens of Hell whom I have never seen, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox, and they flog people with them. (The second one) women kasiyatun &#8216;aariyaat: who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into Paradise, and they would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance (from a great distance).</span></em>” [Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 6840; see also hadith no. 5310]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge interpreted the phrase kasiyatun &#8216;aariyaat (dressed but naked)” as those women who put on tight, short, or light clothes that do not shield what is underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah mentioned that the clothes of women in their homes at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) covered what is between the ankle and the palm; when they would leave for the market, it is known that the women of the companions used to wear overflowing dresses that were so long that the lower end of the dress would drag on the earth. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) made it permissible for them to lower the end of their garment to extend to an arm’s span, without exceeding that. However, what became unclear to some women of the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), “<em><span style="color:#008000;">No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman.</span></em>” [Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 338] and of ‘awrah of the woman with respect to other women being from her navel to her knee led them to the [false] conclusion that this indicates that it is permissible to wear short clothes. However, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not say, “The dress of a woman is between the navel and the knee, ” such that it would be taken as an an evidence. On the contrary, he said, “no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman.” Therefore, he forbade the one who looks because the one who wears overflowing clothes may accidentally uncover her private parts because of a need or for some other reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, “No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man,” did the companions then wear izar (waist garments) from the navel to the knee or pants from the navel to the knee? Is it now sound for a woman to go out and meet other women having on nothing except that which shields the area from the navel to the knee? No one says this; this is not the case, except with the women of the kufar. So those women who understood otherwise from this hadith are incorrect. The hadith’s meaning is obvious and apparent. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not say, &#8220;“The dress of a woman is between the navel and the knee.&#8221; So women should fear Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) and assume shyness and bashfulness, which is from the characteristics of the woman; this is from iman (faith) as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, “Modesty is a branch of faith” [Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 56] Likewise, we know the parable: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“More bashful than a woman kept in her private quarter.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not even the women of the pre-Islamic era [Jahilliyah] used to shield only that which was between the navel and the knee; this was not even the case with men in that time. Do these women want the Muslim woman to be in a worse situation than the women of Jahilliyah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the dress is something and looking at the ‘awrah is something else. The legal dress of the woman in front of other women should cover that which is between the ankle and the palm. However, if the woman needs to tuck up her dress for work or something else, then she may tuck it all the way to the knee. Similarly, if she needs to roll up her sleeves all the way to the shoulder, then she may do so as needed only. However, to make this her normal dress then it is not allowed, and the hadith does not indicate this under any circumstances. That is why the address was to the one looking, not the one being looked at, and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) mentioned absolutely nothing about the dress. He did not say, &#8220;“The dress of a woman is between the navel and the knee,&#8221; such that this would constitute a pretext for the misunderstanding by those women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to looking by mahrams, then the ruling is the same as looking of a woman at a woman, meaning it is permissible for the woman to uncover in front of her mahrams that which she uncovers in front of other women, namely the head, neck, feet, hands, arms, shins, and so forth. But she must not make her dress short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8216;Awrah: The private parts that must be covered.<br />
[2] Mahaarim pl. of mahram a husband and a woman&#8217;s male siblings who are not lawful for her to marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~~<br />
This is the answer of our Shaykh (rahimahullaah) concerning this question, which is often raised by many sisters. I ask Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) to make it a benefit for all of us. All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">By Shaykh Muhadith Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Compiled by Umm Ayyoob Noorah bint ‘Ahsan Ghawee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Ayyoob quotes some of the narrations which Shaykh al-Albani brings about the permissibility for the woman to pray wearing her house dress (regular home clothing) and a Khimar (head covering) and then he brings the narration that she should wear an outer garment type of covering (e.g. like a Abayyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then all of this is understood to be, that it is more complete and better for her to wear an outer garment type of covering and Allaah knows best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Mentioned in ‘Tamaam al-Mina Fee Taleeq ala Fiqh-us-Sunnah’ p.161-162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Ayoob says:‘So in summary: Shaykh Albani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> holds the opinion that it is recommended for the woman to wear the Jilbaab (Abayyah) on top of her house dress and a head covering for the prayer.  His sources for this are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- His understanding of the authentic Athaar (narrations) which show that it is sufficient for the woman to wear a house dress and head covering for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The Shaykh affirms the Athaar which show that the dress of the woman in prayer should be a house dress and head covering along with a Jilbaab or wrapping sheet worn for prayer, or a wrapping garment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Combining between these Athaar which are all authentic, Shaykh Albani concludes that it is recommended for the woman in the prayer to wear a Jilbaab and that it is better and more complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the Shaykh established in his book ‘Tamaam al-Mina Fee Taleeq ala Fiqh-us-Sunnah’ however I want to point to an important point about this topic and that is exemplified in that the Shaykh ‘Allaama al-Albani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> retracted from his saying that of recommendation of  wearing the Jilbaab in the prayer to the opinion of it being <strong>obligatory</strong> to wear it in the prayer, as it occurs in his book ‘Hijaab al-Marrata al-Muslimah Fee al-Kitab wa Sunnah’ and in the book ‘Jilbaab’ in the last print.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This opinion of it being obligatory, is after his book ‘Tamaam al-Mina’ which affirms the Shaykh’s <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> retraction from the opinion of it being recommended to the opinion of it being obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said while refuting the followers of Imaam Shafi’ee :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They say (the followers): that it is recommended for the woman to pray in a long and loose fitting shirt and head covering and to take a Jilbaab thick above her clothing to prevent her showing the size of her limbs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opinion of recommendation negates the apparent order, which is that it is obligatory as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement of Imaam Shafi’ee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> in the book ‘al-Umm’ which we previously mentioned, where he said (1/78):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….and if a man prays in a shirt (garment) which is see through then it is not allowed for him to pray in that . . .  and if he prays in one shirt (garment) which is tight and is not see through then it is disliked for him to pray in that, but it is not mentioned that he should repeat the prayer….. and there is more of a concern for the condition of the woman than the man if she prays in the house dress and head covering by which the house dress shows her size.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albani continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Verily Aeysha <em>-Radi Allaahu anha-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is necessary for the woman to pray wearing three garments: a house dress, a Jilbaab and a head covering.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aeysha used to undo her waist wrapper and wear it as a Jilbaab.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She used to do this so that nothing shown from her clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Her statement: ‘It is necessary…’ is an evidence that it is obligatory to wear the Jilbaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, with the same meaning is the statement of Ibn Umar <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> :‘If a woman prays then she should pray in all her garments: house dress, head covering and a wrapping garment (i.e. like an Abayya or sheet).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Jilbaab al-Maraatul Muslimah Fee al-Kitaab wa Sunnah’ p.134-135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Ayyoob continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So the Shaykh has two opinions in this issue, the opinion that it is recommended, to which I previously indicated to, and the other opinion of it being obligatory, which he affirmed in the various prints of his book ‘Jilbaab al-Maraah’, and this is a strong proof of the Shaykh’s trustworthy responsibility of knowledge and how he retracted from what he viewed as a mistake, and how he was very careful with the truth and researching it, may Allaah have a lot of mercy upon him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Various women’s issues from the Fiqh of ‘Allaama al-Albani <em>–Rahimullaah’</em> &#8211; compiled by Umm Ayyoob p.57-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>The Ruling of the Prayer in which Tight Fitted Clothing is Worn</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">By</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Shaykh Muhadith</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Translated by</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Ayyoob said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This question was put to the Shaykh: Is it permissible for the woman to pray in tight fitted clothing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If the intent by the word ‘permissible’ you mean is the prayer accepted? Then apparently the prayer is accepted. And if the intent of the word ‘permissible’ you mean that it is no problem for her to pray like that, then that is a problem, because as you know that from the conditions of dress by which one must cover the ‘Awraah (the private area) regarding a man let alone women that it should not show the size of the ‘Awraah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we do not have any evidence to say that prayer in this condition is invalid.  But there is no doubt that with the second meaning that it would be okay for her to pray wearing tight fitted clothing, then this is not allowed, as for the prayer then it is accepted.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> added by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is necessary that she wears above her clothing the like of an ‘Abayyaa, wrapping sheet worn for prayer and things similar to that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Various women’s issues from the Fiqh of ‘Allaama al-Albani <em>–Rahimullaah</em>’ &#8211; compiled by Umm Ayyoob p.59]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Hadeeth No. 460 from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">By the Muhadith, Allama, Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“On the authority of Umm Salamah: that when the Messenger of Allaah <em>-SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said what he said about trailing the hem of a garment for the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah mentions: then I asked: O Messenger of Allaah! How should we trail the hem of a garment?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:  Trail it by a hand span.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah said: But the feet become uncovered!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: Then trail it a forearms length.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (al-Albaani) say: In this hadeeth there is a proof showing that the feet of a woman are <em>‘Awrah</em> (i.e. those parts of the body that must be covered) and this was a matter that was well known amongst the women at the time of the Prophet <em>sall’Allaahu alayhi wasallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since, when the Prophet said: ‘Trail it by a hand span,’ Umm Salaamah said: “Then the feet become uncovered” and from this, one feels that she knew that the feet are from the <em>‘Awrah</em>.  It is not permissible to uncover them and the Prophet <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> reaffirmed that for her and that is why he commanded her to trail her garment a forearm<strong>’</strong>s length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Noble Qur’aan there is a reference to this fact and that is the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em>:  &lt;&lt;<strong>And</strong><strong> let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment</strong>&gt;&gt; [Soorah Noor: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*        *       *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked a question regarding trailing the hem of the <em>Hijaab</em> for the woman:  “Is it a condition that it should trail by a hand span or a forearm’s length?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh answered by saying: “This condition is if the clothing of a woman was like the clothing of the women in the past, i.e. because the women before used to only wear a <em>Kamees</em> (long dress) i.e. like a <em>thobe</em>.  This means they did not wear a <em>sirwaal</em> (like pyjamas) nor socks, nor anything that would cover her shins nor her feet, except this long <em>kamees</em> which used to be dragged along the floor, which is generally known as the <em>Abaya</em>.  Nowadays if a woman wears socks or perhaps a long <em>sirwaal</em>, even though this is not common, then it is sufficient for the jilbaab to cover the top of her feet.  It is not necessary for the hem of the garment to be dragging along the floor except in the situation when she cannot find, from her clothing, the likes of a <em>sirwaal</em> or socks etc. because, verily the Messenger &#8211; alayhis sallam- ordered her to lengthen her garment fearing that anything of the <em>‘Awrah</em> of her feet or shins be uncovered.  So, if they are covered with clothing or socks and over the top of them is the long <em>Jilbaab</em>then it is not necessary, in this situation, for the hem of the garment to be dragging along the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: May Allaah reward you</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: May Allaah preserve you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: So it is understood from your speech, that there is no problem if the shoes become uncovered or some of the socks are shown?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: No, I said to you that the <em>Jilbaab</em> should cover the top of the feet. Then you also mentioned shoes, the condition for the shoes is that they shouldn’t be decorated, because nowadays most women’s shoes are decorated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Questioner: May Allaah reward you</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh: May Allaah preserve you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Zayd bin Muhammad Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: His treatise &#8220;Wujoob Sitr-il-Wajhi wal-Kafayn&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> An explanation of the conditions required for the Hijaab to fulfill its religious objective. Below is a list of the Hijaab’s necessary conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Hijaab must cover a woman’s entire body, based on Allaah’s statement: <b>“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the believing women to cast their jalaabeeb over themselves (i.e. their bodies).”</b> [33:59] You have already come to know from what we have written previously that the jilbaab is a long garment that is ample enough to cover the entire body and that the meaning of the word idnaa (to cast) is <b>“to lower”</b> and <b>“to let down”</b> as was stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The garment must be thick, not thin and transparent. This is since the objective of the Hijaab, which is to veil a woman’s entire body and her hidden and apparent adornment, cannot be achieved with a thin garment. Therefore, that which a great amount of covered women wear today, which they call the ‘abaa’ah (cloak) or the malaa’ah (mantle), but which are transparent and describe the skin, such that the onlooker can see what lies beneath the garment, is not considered a legitimate Hijaab since it only brings about an increase in her ability to entice (men) with her attractive and alluring features. And yet they only wear it so that it could be said: “They are wearing Hijaab.” So we seek Allaah’s refuge from deception, the harm of which only falls on those who love and are infatuated with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The Hijaab must not be a source of decoration in itself, such as by it being colorful and flashy, causing eyes to turn towards it and hearts to be diseased (with temptation). We explained previously the meaning of Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8220;And (tell the believing women) not to display their zeenah (adornment) except for that which is apparent from it.”</b> [24:31] So since it is this way, then every Hijaab that does not prevent the display of one’s adornment in front of male-strangers, is not a valid Hijaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It must be ample and loose, since a tight garment outlines the body and reveals it in front of male strangers. So it goes against the objective that is sought after from the obligation of Hijaab. Furthermore, from the various types of tight clothes is that which is called pants, since it does not properly cover what it goes over. On top of that, it describes and outlines the body, as well as resembling the dress of men, and the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) cursed: <b>“The man who wears a woman’s garment and the woman who wears a man’s garment.”</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood and An-Nasaa’ee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. It is also required for the Hijaab not to be perfumed, since fragrances cause men’s desires to be incited and for them to be tempted, against their wills. So a woman who does this carries the sin of her action as well as the sin of those who respond to her active call to this type of fornication. It is reported in a hadeeth collected by the Sunan compilers and others that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Indeed, when a woman perfumes herself and then passes by a gathering, she is such and such”</b> – meaning a fornicator. And in another narration, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Verily, when a woman perfumes herself and then passes by a group of people such that they can smell her scent, she is a fornicator.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These, O Muslim brothers and sisters, are the conditions required for the Hijaab to achieve its intended objective. So we must fear Allaah and be dutiful to Him by obeying what He has commanded and abstaining from what He has forbidden, and by following His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>), for indeed this brings success in both this life and the next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Zayd bin Muhammad Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: His treatise &#8220;Wujoob Sitr-il-Wajhi wal-Kafayn&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> A clarification of the rulings that can be derived from the evidences on Hijaab, and they are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The obligation of the legislated Hijaab is definite and binding on all of the believing women, there being no room for lenience or negotiation with regard to abolishing it or belittling its status and its significance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A clarification that the Prophet’s chaste wives and noble daughters serve as the best examples and most outstanding role models for all Muslim women when it comes to implementing the issue of Hijaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The prescribed Hijaab is that which covers a woman’s adornment, garments and all of her body, which includes the face and the hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The obligation of wearing the Hijaab on the Muslim woman consists of honoring her status, raising her rank, and protecting her dignity and personality. In fact it protects the whole society from the avenues of mischief and corruption appearing in it and the spreading of vile acts amongst its people and inhabitants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. A severe warning to the Muslim woman against her wearing that which will make the eyes of men look towards her or which will make their hearts incline to her or which will incite the causes of mischief. Such enticements include wearing perfumes and cosmetics. However she is permitted to wear these when she is in the presence of her husband or her male guardians according to the limits of the noble Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. There is nothing wrong with children, young boys and whoever else falls under their ruling, to enter into a woman’s presence due to the lack of there occurring any <i>fitnah</i> or danger from them, as is apparent from the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The obligation of repenting to Allaah in general and to seek forgiveness for falling short of abiding by the Hijaab in particular, hoping for Allaah’s Contentment and Mercy, and desiring to attain success in both this world and the next life, acting on Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And turn in repentance to Allaah, all of you, O believers, in order that you may be successful.”</b> [Surah An-Noor: 31]</p>

<p><strong>About the Book</strong> :</p>
<p>This is a  translation of the booklet <strong>Wujoob Sitr-il-Wajhi wal-Kafayn</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this small treatise, Shaikh Zayd AI-Madkhalee briefly outlines the textual proofs for the obligation of veiling from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, accompanying that with logical and customary proofs that strengthen his argument, which was written as a reply to an article allowing the unveiling of a woman&#8217;s face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issue of a woman being obligated to veil her face or not is something that the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah have differed on from the past up until this present day. So it is from the matters in which differing is permitted and which does not lead to division or splitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By presenting this treatise, we hope to provide clarity on the proofs and evidences of those who hold the opinion that a woman is obligated to veil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan</strong> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“What is your advice to the male guardians of certain women that are lax when it comes to the issue of the Hijaab and who are engrossed in exposing their alluring bodily features to male-strangers in the markets and other places? What is the role of a woman’s male guardian in safeguarding her Religion?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So he replied: </strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah says: <b>‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allaah has favored some of them (i.e. men) over others (women).’</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34] Allaah has enabled and entrusted men to take care of and be responsible for women. And He commanded the women to obey Him and forbade them from disobeying Him. This includes the Hijaab.The Hijaab is one of Allaah’s commandments. So therefore it is an obligation on her male-guardian to require her to wear it, regardless is he is her direct male-guardian such as her father, son, brother or someone who has guardianship over her, or if he is the general guardian, such as the Muslim ruler who may mandate the Muslim women to wear the Hijaab.</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim ruler may oblige the women of his country to wear the Hijaab, in the general sense, while the male guardians in charge of households may oblige the women who live in their homes to wear the Hijaab (in the specific sense). They are responsible for these women. If the women knew that the general ruler in charge of her affairs as well as her specific male-guardian oblige her to obey Allaah and abandon disobeying Him, she would not put up any resistance in these matters. But when the male-guardians show laxity in these matters, the women become audacious. And there are callers to evil, lewdness, and hypocrisy behind them who encourage them to unveil and take off the Hijaab.</p>
<p>So the matter today is dangerous. It is incumbent upon a woman’s male guardians – both the general and the specific ones – to assist and aid one another in obliging the women to abide by the Hijaab. It is also an obligation upon the male guardians, may Allaah grant them correctness, to silence the tongues of those who invite to evil and corruption – those who call to unveiling and to the removal of the Hijaab. This is what Allaah has entrusted them with.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[Article taken from ‘Invitation to Islam’ newsletter, September 1997]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amidst the hustle and bustle of a teeming metropolis, a solitary figure traverses. She moves steadily in her black garment which shields her against the tyranny of this life. Whilst others around her rush frantically, she move with tranquillity and ease. The peace which she achieves beneath this veil of hers, is immense. It is a liberation beyond measure. Is this a princess of royal blood? No. Is she a head of state? No. So who is this woman of serenity? This is a woman of Hijaab. A woman amongst many women. A Muslim Woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The site of a woman covering from top to bottom, is not so rare anymore in the major cities of the West. For many Westerners it represents the oppression which Islam imposes upon women. For Muslims however, it is the realisation that Islam will eventually reach every corner of this planet. This is not surprising, considering that Islam is the fastest growing religion on Earth. What is surprising, for Westerners, is that 7 out of 10 <b>(70%)</b> people who become Muslim are Women! It is these same women who then go on to <b>willingly</b> observe the Hijab without coercion or force. The women of Hijaab in the cities of London, Paris, New York etc, are not all immigrants who have just stepped off the boat, as many people think. Rather, many of them tend to be women of high intellect and education. Women who have experienced the bitterness of western oppression. Women of diverse nationalities and races, who are brought together as one, under the banner of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>An Islaamic Duty</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ever since the appearance of Hijaab in the west, there has been a constant crusade against this noble act. The hypocrisy[1] of the Western media has been evident for many years now, through its constant attacks on Islam and Hijaab. Despite these attempts, women in Hijaab are still on the increase. Thus, a new crusade had to be launched by the advocates of &#8220;liberation&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221;. For a while now, many Western critics have insisted that the Hijaab has nothing to do with Islaam. They claim that it is a cultural practice and not a religious one. This has been broadcast in the Western media with the aid of its puppets, the modernist Muslims. People such as Dr Zaki Badawi[2], have pushed this erroneous view for a number of years now. This has led to much confusion amongst ignorant Muslims, and many Muslim women are being led into depriving themselves of this great benefit. So what is the reality behind this issue? Is the Hijaab obligatory?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hijab is an Arabic word which literally means a cover, a screen or a partition. Islamically it refers to the dress code of the Muslim woman. In answering the above question, as Muslims we unashamedly say, <b>Yes!</b>, the Hijaab <b>IS OBLIGATORY!!</b> The proofs for this obligation are many, but due to lack of space we will only quote two here. In the Qur’an Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty, and not to display their adornment except that which appears ordinarily thereof, and to draw their veils over their necks and bosoms..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura An-Noor 24:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the words &#8220;..except that which appears ordinarily thereof..&#8221;, then the scholars of Islam have explained that these words refer to the hands and face of a woman. This is supported by the hadith of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) : <i>&#8220;Aisha reported that Asmaa, the daughter of Abu Bakr, entered into the presence of the Messenger of Allaah wearing thin transparent clothing, So the Messenger of Allaah turned away from her saying : ‘O’ Asmaa, when a women reaches the age of menstruation, it is <b>not allowed</b> that any of her should be seen except this’ – and he pointed to his face and two hands.&#8221;</i>[3] The Hijaab is therefore something which <b>MUST</b> cover the entire body of a woman, except her face and hands.[4] It is <b>NOT</b> a simple headscarf which many women wear, because a piece of cloth on the head does not conceal the parts of a woman’s body, which when exposed, are the result of much strife. Besides covering the entire body, the Hijaab also has other conditions, such as not being tight, transparent, too colourful or resembling the clothes of a man. These conditions are also proven from Islaam.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Benefits of Hijaab</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-Obedience-</b> Whilst other women are subjected to the pressures and slavery of modern society, the Muslim woman is truly free from this. In the west, women are expected to conform to the liberal fashions which appear daily. These fashions and expectations are often shaped by men. In this way, women become the slaves of society and man. Hijab is the liberator of this slavery. It takes women away from the obedience of man, to the obedience of the Most Perfect, Allaah. This obedience will only bring about good, because we believe that Allaah is the Most Kind and the Most Just. Slavery to the one with such characteristics, is a slavery of reward and contentment. It is not a slavery from which your fellow human (the woman) is exploited and oppressed, just because your desires and lusts run wild.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a command of Allaah, the Hijaab has united the hearts of so many. Hijaab knows no colour, nationality, race, height or weight. Through obedience to Allaah, it truly unites the women of the world. Thus, this unification has surpassed the ranks and shallowness of all female liberation movements. Christian nuns, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, feminists, lesbians, women boxers and even female gang members, are all known to have become united under Islam and its Hijaab. It is truly a force to be reckoned with. It must be remembered that this obedience to Allaah is a voluntary act from most Muslim women. Many assume that those brought up as Muslims, have always been wearing Hijaab. However, this is not so. Many Muslim women (especially in the UK), who are Muslim by name, often know very little of Islam. When they discover its true meaning, most of them willingly adopt the Hijaab simply to obey their Creator, and not because of any external pressures.<br />
Wearing the Hijaab is no futile action. A woman may go through much trial and tribulation[6] because she has obeyed Allaah. But the fulfilment of this action will never go unnoticed, as Allaah say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Never will I allow to be lost the actions of any of you; whether male or female&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Imran 3:195).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The result of these obedient actions will be an everlasting reward. A reward which all Muslim women aspire for. A reward called paradise :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever does righteous actions- whether male or female, and is a believer, will enter paradise&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura An-Nisa 4:124).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-A Shield-</b> Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O’ Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their veils over their bodies. That is most convenient that they should be recognised and not be molested&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura Al-Ahzab 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the greatest benefits of Hijaab, is the natural protection it gives to a woman. By wearing Hijaab, a woman shields herself from the rampant desires of man. By his very nature, man is a creature of intense desire. The Hijaab controls this desire and thus not only protects the woman, but also the man. Sexually motivated crimes in the west are on the increase. Rape, molestation and harassment are reaching epidemic levels. Undoubtedly the clothing of a woman has something to do with this. When women walk around with literally nothing on, some men see it as a signal to do as they please. This results in the honour of a woman being scarred for life. The Muslim woman does not have this problem. She knows that when she walks on the streets, the men will not look at her. Why? Because there is nothing for them to look at!! She feels like a princess who is shielded from the savages of her domain. Peace and security is felt beneath the veil. The woman of Hijaab does not have to reveal her body in order to gain respect. She does not have to have her ‘bits’ hanging out so that men can drool over her. If a man desires her, then it has to be for her religion and intellect. The Hijaab gives him no other choice. She is a woman who is truly shielded from the nature of man.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-Nature-</b> The nature of a woman is fundamentally different from man. Women are more timid, gentle and caring then men. This is the reason why they have been chosen (by Allaah) to be the perfect rearers of children. The Hijaab reinforces this nature of the woman. We praise Allaah that he has ordered this Hijaab, for the world that we live in seeks to change our very nature as human beings. Men try to be women and women try to be men. People are being led into confusion by the political correctness which is so popular in our societies. Many women have jumped onto the bandwagon of feminism and lesbianism, shouting how evil and oppressive men are. But when one looks at these sad creatures, their delusion is clear. While claiming to hate men, their attire suggests otherwise. Short hair, bomber jackets and steel toecapped boots, are the vogue for these women. Their hatred for men is so much, that their very appearance resembles the enemy!! Some of these women have even gone to the extreme of growing masses of facial hair. The hideous site of these bearded ladies, is enough to put anyone off their dinner!!! Such depravity is far from natural. The Hijab on the other hand, enables the woman to stay as a woman. Rather then being a monstrosity, a woman in Hijab is like an oyster with a beautiful pearl inside it. Her femininity has stayed feminine, without being altered into masculinity. There is no doubt about it, this is a <b>TRUE WOMAN</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-Honour-</b> Contrary to the tales of the media, the Hijab provides an honour for the woman like no other garment does. For many women, a dress designed by Versace[8] or Armani is all the honour they need. But the Hijaab carries far more honour then these worthless clothes. Whilst the dresses of the catwalks are designed by mere mortals, the Hijaab comes from the one who is immortal, Allaah. Through it a woman is held with the utmost respect. True Muslim men are obliged to keep their Muslim sisters away from the corruption of this world. Thus a Muslim will not allow for someone to ogle his wife, chat her up or harass her. The honour of a Muslim woman demands that this does not happen. How contrary this is to life in the west. Men in the west feel no obligation to protect women from the harms of society. This is why a man will allow his wife to be a stripper, call-girl and even a prostitute. Honour knows no place in the west. This honour will only be achieved from Islam and its Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The honour of a Muslim woman is so high, that we believe that the state of a society is dependent upon its women. If the women are corrupt and immoral, then the society will be corrupt and immoral. If the women are righteous and god-fearing, then the society will be righteous and god-fearing. Women are the educators of the nation. But if they have no honour and have been corrupted, then society will be void of education and steeped in ignorance. This is the predicament of a society which rejects Hijab. This is the predicament of all Western societies, which stubbornly cling onto their depressing ways of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who seek to reject Hijab after reading this, then their loss will eventually become apparent. But those who seek to please Allaah through this action, can be sure that this good can only bring more good:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Is there any reward for good – other then goodness?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura Ar-Rahman 55:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:-</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The British media is an example of this. Whilst condemning the Hijaab as oppressive, it is well known that newspapers such as The Sun and The News of the World, often display pictures of naked women. This of course, is the liberation which the West claims to give women!<br />
2. Dr Zaki Badawi is a self-styled mufti who is unfortunately seen as a public face of Islam. A number of years ago, Dr. Badawi appeared on Dutch T.V. proclaiming that Hijaab was not obligatory. This announcement caused much confusion and resulted in some women taking their Hijaab off.<br />
3. Authentic – Reported by Al-Bayhaqee.<br />
4. Even though it is not obligatory to cover the face and hands, it is without doubt recommended that the niqaab (the face veil) and/or gloves be worn. Such acts are seen as modesty and piety from the woman, and they can only bring her more reward.<br />
5. The proofs for these conditions can be found in an excellent book entitled &#8220;The Islamic ruling regarding Women’s dress, according to the Qur’an and Sunnah&#8221; by Abu Bilal Mustafa Al-Kanadi.<br />
6. Wearing Hijaab in the West can be a struggle for many women. The hypocrisy of the West is such, that it does not respect this choice which is made willingly, and subjects these women to much psychological pressure. 2 years ago, two Muslim girls were even expelled from a school in France because they wore Hijaab. Freedom has truly been given a new meaning!<br />
7. &#8220;A view through Hijaab&#8221; is an informative account of life in Hijaab. Written by Khaula Nakata, it is the experience of Hijaab as seen through the eyes of a Japanese woman who embraced Islam.<br />
8. There will be no more dresses designed by Gianni Versace!! The evils of Homosexuality ensured that this man (?) reaped the fruits of his unholy labour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Enjoining certain Manners so that the Mothers of the Believers may be an Example; and the Prohibition of Tabarruj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the good manners which Allah enjoined upon the wives of the Prophet so that they would be an example for the women of the Ummah to follow. Allah said, addressing the wives of the Prophet that they should fear Allah as He commanded them, and that no other woman is like them or can be their equal in virtue and status. Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then be not soft in speech,) As-Suddi and others said, this means, do not be gentle in speech when addressing men. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire,) means, something unclean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُلْنَ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but speak in an honorable manner.) Ibn Zayd said: &#8220;Decent and honorable talk that is known to be good.&#8221; This means that she should address non-Mahram men in a manner in which there is no softness, i.e., a woman should not address a non-Mahram man in the same way that she addresses her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And stay in your houses,) means, stay in your houses and do not come out except for a purpose. One of the purposes mentioned in Shari`ah is prayer in the Masjid, so long as the conditions are fulfilled, as the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَا تَمْنَعُوا إِمَاءَ اللهِ مَسَاجِدَ اللهِ وَلْيَخْرُجْنَ وَهُنَّ تَفِلَات»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the Masjids of Allah, but have them go out without wearing fragrance.) According to another report:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَبُيُوتُهُنَّ خَيْرٌ لَهُن»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(even though their houses are better for them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) Mujahid said: &#8220;Women used to go out walking in front of men, and this was the Tabarruj of Jahiliyyah.&#8221; Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Taburruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;When they go out of their homes walking in a shameless and flirtatious manner, and Allah, may He be exalted, forbade that.&#8221; Muqatil bin Hayyan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;Tabarruj is when a woman puts a Khimar on her head but does not tie it properly.&#8221; So her necklaces, earrings and neck, and all of that can be seen. This is Tabarruj, and Allah addresses all the women of the believers with regard to Tabarruj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءَاتِينَ الزَّكَـوةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and perform the Salah, and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.) Allah first forbids them from evil, then He enjoins them to do good by establishing regular prayer, which means worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, and paying Zakah, which means doing good to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and obey Allah and His Messenger.) This is an instance of something specific being followed by something general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">May Allaah keep you firm. We hope from you clarification of the evidence that points to the obligation of covering the face for the woman.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The evidence is from Quran and Sunnah (Allaah says)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And when you ask for something, ask them from behind a hijaab.&#8221;</span>(33:53)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">And the hijaab is that which conceals the women from a cloth, a wall or a door.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Allaah says;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be harmed&#8230;&#8221;</span> (33:59)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in the hijaab is prevention from the harm of evil doers (from) what they desire from her. If she covers then the evil doers and hypocrites will have no desire for her. But if she removes (it) then the evil doers and hypocrites will desire what she has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas was asked about the meaning of the verse, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments&#8221;</span> (33:59) He then took the area of his garment and placed it over his face; clarifying that this is the meaning of it (covering the face).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aaisha (may Allaah be pleased with her) said <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;when we were with the Messenger of Allaah in the state of ihram (during hajj); when men would pass by us we would put our khimar down over our heads and faces and when the men would proceed by us we would remove it. All this was in the presence of the prophet س لم و ع ل يه صل and he approved of that</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hijaab my brothers Allaah mentioned regarding it two benefits;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first benefit:</strong> that it is purification for the heart (as Allaah says) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That is more pure for your hearts and for theirs&#8221;</span> (33:53) And what single male or female Muslim does not want a pure heart?!</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second benefit</strong>: it prevents the harm of the hypocrites and evil doers and (their) enjoyment of her. So when she (properly) wears hijaab they are not able to see her face; therefore finding pleasure in her. (Allaah says) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That is more suitable that they will be known&#8221;</span> (33:59) Meaning they will be known for chastity<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;and not be harmed&#8221;</span> (33:59) (Meaning) their desires for her will be cut (off), but if they see her revealing and uncovered; they will desire her and harm her.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Should a woman cover her feet when she prays?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for her to pray with her feet uncovered, indeed it is not permissible for her to walk in the streets with her feet uncovered, because the feet are part of a woman’s <em>`awrah</em></strong><strong> </strong>based on Allaah’s عز وجل Statement: {And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment}.[1] The woman during the Days of Ignorance used to wear what is known in the Arabic language as<em> khalkhaal</em> (anklet), meaning a bracelet with small bells. So when the woman walked, she – in order to turn the men’s attention to her – would strike the ground with her feet so the anklet would make a noise and the men would hear that; and such was due to <em>shaitaan’</em>s whisperings to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the feet used to be covered. Because of what? Because of the<em>jilbaab</em> that the women were commanded to cast down from over their heads, according to Allaah’s Statement: {O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their outer garments  (<em>jilbaab</em>s) close upon themselves}.[2] And it is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> that the Prophet ﷺ said one day during a gathering in which there were also women: ‘Whoever drags his garment out of pride, Allaah عز وجل will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.’ One of the women said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, then our feet will be exposed.’ He ﷺ said: ‘let the women lengthen (their garments) by a hand-span.’ She said: ‘Then a wind will come and uncover (their feet).’ He ﷺ said: ‘let them add another hand-span, i.e. (a total of) one cubit, and not go beyond that.’[3] [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this manner, the<em> jilbaab</em> of the Muslim woman – at the time of the revelation of the above-mentioned verse: {to draw their outer garments (<em>jilbaab</em>s) close upon themselves} – used to cover the feet since the socks that are widespread nowadays among both women and men were not widespread at that time. The woman used to cover her shins and feet with the long<em> jilbaab</em> that resembles the <em>`</em><em>abaa.ah</em>. Therefore it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover her feet while she is on the street, and it is even more impermissible for her to pray with her feet uncovered.”</p>

[2] Surat ul-Ahzaab 33:59<br />
[3] the Shaikh mentioned the general meaning, not the exact wording, of the woman’s speech<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Alifta.net &#8211; Fatwa no. 17929</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the final Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta</strong>&#8216; has read the letter which was sent to his Eminence, the Grand Mufty, from the questioners, Chairman and Members of Association of Islamic law at the Faculty of Shari`ah and Islamic Studies at the university of Kuwait. This letter was transferred to the Committee by the Secretariat-General of the Council of Senior Scholars under the number 1202 in 11/03/1416 A. H. The questioners asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible that a male teacher teaches female students without there being a screen between them so that they see each other? It may be important to mention that mostly the teacher does not see their faces as they wear the face veil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible that a female student attends the office of her male teacher and the latter talks with her without there being a screen between them but mostly without seeing her face? Is it permissible that such a student takes a seat inside the office of a male teacher speaking with him about the field of study and so on, while no Mahram (spouse or permanently unmarriageable relative) accompanies her or she is accompanied by one of her female schoolmates and the teacher explains the lesson to them or answers their questions which are related to lectures and so on? It may be worthy to mention that the foregoing can be done by phone and that some of the teachers are still in their youth or have just started their old age while the female students are mostly in the beginning of their youth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Committee had studied the question it answered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, intermixing of men and women in schools or any other places is considered a great Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Shari`ah and Muslims of sound intellect) and a great evil with regard to the affairs of both Din (religion) and the world. Thus,<span style="color:#ff6600;"> it is not permissible for women to study or work in a place which intermixes men and women</span>. Similarly, their guardians should not allow them to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;">it is neither permissible for men to teach unveiled women nor to teach women wearing Shar`y (Islamically acceptable) veil in privacy.</span> By the way, all of the body of a woman is `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered) as far as a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) is concerned. As for covering the head and showing the face, this is not full Hijab (veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;">it is permissible for a man to teach women from behind a screen in female schools where there is no intermixing of male and female students or male and female teachers</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If female students need to ask their male teacher about something, this should be done through closed communication networks, which are renowned and available, or via phones, however, such students should be careful not to soften their speech.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Your Eminence, once we heard you mention that a woman who offers Salah with her hands and feet uncovered must repeat the whole Salah. Please clarify this matter for us, knowing that we are practicing Muslims abiding by Shari`ah (Islamic law). Since we have heard this ruling, my wife has been covering her feet and hands during Salah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Scholars (may Allah be merciful to them) stated that a woman&#8217;s entire body is `Awrah, and thus she has to cover it all in Salah except the face. This is based on what was reported in the Hadiths from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) that state that all a woman&#8217;s body is `Awrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars differed as to whether the hands should be covered or not. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Regarding the feet, the Jumhur stated that they should be covered</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the face, there is nothing wrong in uncovering it according to Ijma` (consensus of scholars). In fact, uncovering it in Salah is Sunnah unless there is an Ajnaby present. <span style="color:#800080;">The correct view in this regard is that a woman when offering Salah must cover all her body except the face and hands</span>. According to the correct scholarly opinion, it is not obligatory to cover her hands, but if she covers them, this is better in order to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars who hold that covering them is obligatory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">As for the feet, it is obligatory to cover them according to Jumhur because all a woman&#8217;s body is `Awrah and the feet are considered `Awrah. Thus, there is no reason to uncover them and <span style="color:#ff0000;">they should be covered whether by wearing socks or long garments</span> while offering Salah.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I said and clarified more than once on the program &#8220;Nur `ala Al-Darb (Light on the Way)&#8221; is that it is obligatory for a woman to cover her entire body so that nothing of it shows. She should not wear something see-through. Her garments must be concealing, not showing her hair and body except the face; for it is Sunnah to uncover it if there is no Ajnaby present. As for the hands, scholars differed as to the ruling on them, but it is better to cover them. If a woman uncovers them, there is nothing wrong with this. As for the feet, as mentioned above, it is obligatory to cover them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">As for having to make up for the Salah, this is due to having violated one of the conditions of Salah by offering Salah without covering the feet. Therefore, if a woman offers Salah without covering her feet, she has to make up for it. But if she does so out of ignorance of the ruling, may Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) forgive her for what is past and she does not have to make up for the past Salahs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that: He saw a man offering Salah quickly. He called him and the man came and greeted him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, &#8220;Go back and offer Salah, for you have not offered Salah.&#8221; The man went back and offered Salah as he had offered it before, then he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and greeted him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) returned the greeting and said to him, &#8220;Go back and offer Salah, for you have not offered Salah.&#8221; The man again offered Salah as he had offered it before. When he had done this three times, he said: By the One Who sent you with the Truth as a Prophet, I cannot do any better than this. Please, teach me. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “When you go to offer Salah, perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution) properly, face the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer), pronounce Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;), and then recite whatever you can of the Qur&#8217;an. Then bow until you are at ease in that position, then rise until you are standing erect, then prostrate until you are at ease in your prostration, then raise yourself and sit until you are at ease in sitting. Do this throughout the entire Salah.” (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered this man to repeat the presently due Salah and did not order him to repeat any past Salah, because the man was ignorant about the ruling. It seemed that the man was accustomed to offering Salah in such a manner; but because he was ignorant about the ruling, the Prophet (peace be upon him) excused him from making up for the past Salahs and merely ordered him to repeat the Salah due at that time. This indicates that whoever is ignorant about a ruling of Salah then becomes informed about it has to only repeat the presently due Salah. As for past Salahs, they are waived because of ignorance. This is what is implied by the Hadith, for the Messenger (peace be upon him) did not order the man who offered Salah incorrectly to repeat his past Salahs due to ignorance and because this entails hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same way, if a woman is used to offering Salah without covering her feet out of ignorance about the ruling, she does not have to repeat the past Salahs, in sha’a-Allah, according to the correct scholarly opinion. This is because she is excused because of ignorance. Thereafter, she has to abide by covering her feet and the rest of her body when offering Salah. This excludes the face and hands as mentioned above because they are not `Awrah according to scholars. But if she covers her hands to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars, this is good as stated above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR:     Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE:     Masaa&#8217;il Nisaa&#8217;iyyah Mukhtaarah (pg. 125-131)<br />
PRODUCED BY:     Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="font-size:small;">The following excerpt was taken from the book &#8220;Masaa&#8217;il Nisaa&#8217;iyyah Mukhtaarah min Fiqh al-&#8216;Alaamah Al-Albaanee&#8221; [Selected Women&#8217;s Issues from the Fiqh of Imaam Al-Albaanee] compiled by Umm Ayoob Ghaawee. This book contains a collection of Al-Albaanee&#8217;s opinions on various issues related to women transcribed from his books, recorded lessons and lectures.</span></em></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Al-Albaanee was asked the following question in a recorded talk: “We would like more details on the definition of a jilbaab, since you have stated that your view on the jilbaab is that it is a garment that covers the body from the head to the feet. However, we have come across a rather large difference of opinion in the language books concerning this. Amongst the linguists are those who say it is a large gown, while others say it is a khimaar. And others hold the same view you mentioned, Shaikh. So we would like a further elaboration, may Allaah reward you, as well as which one is the strongest opinion.”</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh responded to the questioner: “I’m sorry but I’m having difficulty understanding the part where you said that some people hold the jilbaab to be the khimaar. What is the khimaar that you are referring to when you say that they consider it to be the jilbaab? This is because it is well-known that the khimaar is a head-covering and not an ample garment that covers a woman’s entire body from her head to her feet. So who is it that claims that the jilbaab is a khimaar from what you know, according to what I mentioned? This is truly a very strange thing. Who said this?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner said: “This is mentioned in the book <em>Lisaan-ul-‘Arab</em>, where it states that such a definition for it is held by some people.”</p>
<p>The Shaikh said: “It states that the jilbaab is a khimaar?”</p>
<p>The questioner said: “Yes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh replied: “It is not possible to say this because as you know there are two ayahs in the Qur’aan – one ayah that orders women to wear the jilbaab while the other orders them to put on the khimaar. It is not possible to say that both ayahs contain a repetition of the same meaning, thus the jilbaab would be the khimaar, while the khimaar would be the jilbaab. Rather, both of these terms – the jillbaab and the khimaar – have their own respective meanings that are distinct from one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You know, for example, that when a woman is at home and she gets up to pray her obligatory prayers, for the most part, she is normally at home with her hair uncovered. So she just places her khimaar over her head. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>&#8216;Allaah does not accept the prayer of a mature woman unless she has a khimaar.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant here is not the jilbaab at all, but rather what is meant is the head-covering. From the evidences that indicate this is that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) ordered us to wipe over the turban or the khimaar or the socks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My objective behind this hadeeth is to show that it indicates that the khimaar is a garment that both men and women – males and females – share in wearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It cannot be understood from this, for those who understand the Arabic language, that a man can place a jilbaab over himself! Rather, it means that he can place a khimaar (head-covering) over himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is permissible for a person that places a khimaar over his head to wipe over it (when performing ablution), regardless of whether it is a man or a woman. My objective behind this discussion is to firstly confirm the quote according to the Arabic language, and secondly if it is finally confirmed that the quote is indeed found in Lisaan-ul-‘Arab and that it states that the meaning of a jilbaab is held to be a khimaar, then it is sufficient proof, from what you quoted, that such a statement is weak because of the fact that the author said: ‘It is held to mean such and such.’ (i.e. uncertainty)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, if we study the texts from the Book and the Sunnah, of which we already mentioned some of them, we would derive with certainty that the khimaar is not a jilbaab and nor is the jilbaab a khimaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, a khimaar covers less that a jilbaab while a jilbaab has a more ample range in terms of the parts that it covers. Also, a jilbaab is specific for only women. They were the ones who were ordered to wear it and not men. But as for the khimaar, then that is a garment that both men and women share in wearing. Even though a man is not obligated to wear it, regardless, it is a garment that both men and women partake in wearing, just like a shirt. In the same manner that a man wears a shirt to cover his ‘awrah – which is different from the ‘awrah of a woman – so does a woman. But her ‘awrah is ampler than the ‘awrah of a man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we said in the book ‘The Muslim Woman’s Hijaab’ that when a Muslim woman leaves from her home, she is obligated to do two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) To place a khimaar over her head, and (2) then to apply a jilbaab over that, thus going out dressed with the khimaar and the jilbaab. So when a woman goes out of her home, one garment does not suffice without the other – a woman must combine between both the khimaar and the jilbaab. You are aware of the Qur’anic verse related to the khimaar in which Allaah says: <strong>‘And (tell them) to draw their khumur (veils) over their bosoms.’</strong> [Surah An-Noor: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Drawing a garment close to the bosom cannot be achieved with a jilbaab. This can only be achieved with a khimaar, since it is possible to wrap it. But as for the jilbaab, you know that it cannot be wrapped around the chest or on the neck. You can see here how the men wrap their khimaars and how they affix them to their necks. So due to this, what has been particularized here is the khimaar and not the jilaab. When a woman goes out from her house, she is obligated to place a khimaar over her head and to wrap it over her neck and her chest. This is since a jilbaab does not correspond in her attempt to achieve this comprehensive covering since it is ample and long whereas the khimaar is ample and short. So each of these garments has its own specific effect in fulfilling what a woman is obligated to cover. This is my response to what you have asked. If there is anything left that I have not covered in my discussion, then remind me of it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner asked: “So then I understand from this that the jilbaab is not the wide gown that women wear today, here (in this country) for example, from the neck to the feet?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh responded: “No, not at all. This is not a jilbaab. However, this leads us to elaborate further on discussing what is related to the jilbaab. As we stated before, according to the language, a jilbaab is not a garment like that which is known as the balto. So what needs to be clarified now is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The command directed towards women, particularly with regard to wearing the jilbaab, is not an obligatory act of worship which has a meaning that we can’t comprehend. Rather, on the contrary, it does have a meaning we can understand. And the meaning that is derived from it, which we indicated previously, is to achieve the covering that a woman must abide by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if, for example, a woman wears two garments or she makes the jilbaab into two pieces – one upper piece and one lower piece – and both of these pieces fulfill the objective of the jilbaab, which has been mentioned in the Qur’aan, at this point, even though we don’t refer to these two pieces as a jilbaab from a linguistic standpoint, we hold that it still fulfills the desired objective of the command to wear the jilbaab from a religious perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There used to be found in Syria up to recently, and there still continues to be found in some practicing women that stick to the Religion, a garment called <em>Malaa’at-uz-Zamm</em>. Have you heard anything about this during your lifetime?”</p>
<p>The questioner replied: “We have something called a <em>Malaa’ah</em> (cloak).”</p>
<p>The Shaikh said: “No, I said <em>Malaa’at-uz-Zamm</em>.”</p>
<p>The questioner replied: “No, not with this term. We say <em>Malaa’ah</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said: “This is an Arabic term. The point is that this garment which we have with us in Syria consists of two pieces. The first piece is a skirt known as a <em>tannoorah</em> – are you familiar with this word?”</p>
<p>The questioner said: Yes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said: “A <em>tannoorah</em> is a skirt that is affixed to the waist with an elastic strap. So naturally it is wide and ample.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman wears this from here, thus covering the entire lower part of her body. Then over this <em>tannoorah</em>, which is called a <em>kharraatah</em> (skirt) in Syria, is placed the upper part of the garment, which is placed over the head and which a woman uses to cover her head, shoulders, sides, hips and even the belt strap that is tightened around the waist by this <em>tannoorah</em> or this <em>kharraatah</em>. No part of this skirt’s waist-strap is visible since it goes under it. Is the image clear?”</p>
<p>The questioner replied: “Yes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh continued: “Amongst us here, they call this garment <em>Malaayat-uz-Zamm</em> (or <em>Malaa’at-uz-Zamm</em>), since the skirt is strapped at the waist with a plastic waistband. So if you have grasped a perception of this dress with us, then the point that I am trying to make is that even though this cloak-like garment is not a jilbaab (linguistically), it still fulfills the obligation of a jilbaab, which consists of covering the body completely. Is this clear to you?”</p>
<p>The questioner said: “Yes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said: “If the matter is clear, then we see that we are not obligated to adhere to the literal wording of the jilbaab, but rather to its end-result, objective and goal. Now I will go back to this ‘balto’ which I talked about previously, which the Muslim women wear today and which is of various types. It may be produced in long sizes for some of the practicing women reaching up to their feet. However, this is not a jilbaab. In spite of this, it is still not like the <em>Malaa’at-uz-Zamm</em> since it does not cover the head and what it consist of, for example. But what does the woman do today? She wraps a garment known as the esharp around her head – is this term known to you?”</p>
<p>The questioner answered: “Yes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said: “A small khimaar (i.e. the esharp) that is fastened to the head but which exposes parts of the forehead and temple and which also exposes parts of the neck since it is small in size, naturally does not fulfill the objective of a jilbaab according to its proper definition. The objective of a jilbaab is as we have discussed concerning the <em>Malaayat-uz-Zamm</em>. Is this clear? So let’s take the example of this woman who is wearing this balto – what would you call this?”</p>
<p>The questioner[1] said: “We call it a Hijaab.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said: “No, this is wrong. The point is that if a woman wears this type of ‘Hijaab’ then places a khimaar over her head, then there must be a Hijaab, i.e. jilbaab placed over this khimaar. We have stated that there are two verses in the Qur’aan. This jilbaab may be divided into parts as we stated before when we discussed the <em>Malaayat-uz-Zamm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, if a woman wears that garment which you call a Hijaab and then places a valid khimaar over her head and not that which is known as the ‘<em>esharp’</em>, then places over this khimaar a partial garment that covers half of her body, such as one that covers her shoulders and hands, at this point, this becomes valid and acceptable according to the Religion.” [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: Thanks to Allah, some Japanese women accepted Islam. They began to struggle with the atheist Japanese society that prefers disbelief and distorted Christianity to Islam. Indeed, there are no obligations in the distorted Christianity, so a person may drink Khamr (intoxicant), eat pork, have girl friends, and at the same time be a Christian who believes in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. On the other hanzd, a new Muslim has to stand out and become different from non-Muslims and keeps away from their society and gatherings when it comes to `Aqidah (creed); so they become subject to be ostracized and regarded as insane.Non-Muslims may even isolate new Muslim converts and deny them work. They cannot accept them as fellow Japanese while seeing them do what they deem as awful offense i.e. becoming Muslims, abandoning non-Muslim parties, Khamr, pork, and praying to Allah, the God that such non-Muslim people deny as the true Lord?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The problems the girls face are even worse, as they are weaker and usually depend on work to support themselves or on their non-Muslim families to support them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Among the various problems the Muslim women face is the observation of the religious obligations e.g. wearing the Hijab (veil). Many times, a woman is prevented from wearing Hijab and offering Salah (Prayer) at her workplace. as she cannot pray on time, she makes up for the missed prayers together lest she should be fired from work; her only source to earn her living, as she lives apart from her non-Muslim family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Another problem a Muslim young woman may face is her inability to fast Ramadan when she hides her Islam from her family, especially her strict Christian mother. This mother prefers that her daughter becomes a disbeliever to becoming a Muslim. This girl studies at the university and her family supports her.She lives, eats, and drinks with them in the same house. This might lead her to committing many prohibitions. She cannot fast Ramadan, as this will be strange to her family. If they know of her conversion, they might harm and prevent her from continuing her education which will be her only way to earn her living in the future. A third problem a new Japanese Muslim may face is when his wife and children remain non-Muslims and he does not know what to do about them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">We would like to ask your Eminence the following questions:</span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> 1. What should a Muslim woman do in such circumstances in Japan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> 2. What should this Muslim man do with his non-Muslim wife and children? Is his disbelieving wife still lawful to him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> 3. Is Salah (Prayer) offered by a woman outside her house and in public places while sitting behind a screen to cover her `Awrah (private parts of the body that must be covered in public) valid? May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Firstly</strong>, anyone who reverts to Islam and conceals it lest they should be harmed need to indirectly show the merits of Islam to people they fear from without makingtheir reversion known. They should invoke Allah (Exalted be He) to guide them, perhaps Allah will guide them to accept Islam. This would ward off their evil. If they are not guided and are expected to harm the person, or the country does not allow the practicing of the Islamic rites, then this person should migrate to muslim lands, if possible. Allah (Exalted be He) says, He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allâh, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. i.e. they should find another place away from the place they detest, a way out from deviation to guidance, from distress to relief, and from poverty to welfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A weak person who can not migrate is excused as they are prevented from immigration or due to being a woman. Allah (Exalted be He) says, Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): &#8220;In what (condition) were you?&#8221; They reply: &#8220;We were weak and oppressed on the earth.&#8221; They (angels) say: &#8220;Was not the earth of Allâh spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?&#8221; Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allâh is likely to forgive them, and Allâh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving. These Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) mean that the weak people are not able to develop plans, spend, and direct their way if they migrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, a weak woman should be in contact with the Islamic centers in her country, as they might help her. Otherwise, she should be patient and wait for a way out. She should invoke Him (Exalted be He) to facilitate her affairs. She will be rewarded In sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills). She should abide by the teachings, rulings, and obligatory acts of Islam as much as she can for Allah (Glorified be He) says, So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, If I order you to do something, do as much of it as you can. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim agreed upon its authenticity.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, when a man converts to Islam but his wife remains in disbelief, it is permissible for him to keep her, if she is from the People of the Book (a Christian or a Jew),since the basic ruling is that it is permissible for a Muslim to marry chaste women of the People of the Book. Allah (Exalted be He) says, Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibât [all kinds of Halâl (lawful) foods, which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is not permissible for him to stay with her if she is not from the people of the Book. Allah says, Likewise hold not the disbelieving women as wives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if a woman converts to Islam while her husband remains a disbeliever, she becomes unlawful to him for Allah says, O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them; Allâh knows best as to their Faith, then if you ascertain that they are true believers send them not back to the disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If she is forced to stay with him, she should be patientuntil she finds a way out and there is no harm on her as the early Muslim women did. Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stayed with her husband Abu Al-`As ibn Al-Rabi`, after she converted to Islam, before he converted to Islam. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not separate them. When she followed the Prophet (peace be upon him) to Madinah, their marriage was annulled. However, the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave her back to him after he became a Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>Fourthly</strong>, as for the children, they should follow the best religion of their parents. If one of the parents embraces Islam, all the minor children will be Muslims, as children follow the best religion of their parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>, a woman should cover before any Ajnaby (man lawful for the woman to marry). She should stay away from anything that shows her adornment, stay at her house, and she should not leave it except out of necessity and in such a case she should dress modestly. If the time of Salah is due while she is out of her house, she has to offer it in a place away from men. The excuse mentioned in the question does not exempt her from standing while offering Salah, because standing is a pillar of Salah for anyone who is able to.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A View through Hijab &#8211; By Sister Khaula From Japan 10/25/1993 [57]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A view through Hijaab&#8221; is an informative account of life in Hijaab. Written by Khaula Nakata, it is the experience of Hijaab as seen through the eyes of a Japanese woman who embraced Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>My Story To Islam :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As most of the Japanese, I&#8217;d followed no religion before I embraced Islam in France. I was majoring in French Literature at the university. My favorite thinkers were Sartre, Nietchze and Camas, whose thinking is atheistic. At the same time, however, I was very interested in religion, not because of my inner necessity but of my love for the truth. What was waiting for me after death did not interest me at all; how to live was my concern(58). For a long time I had a sort of impression that I was not doing what I should do and I was wasting my time. Whether God existed or not was the same to me; I just wanted to know the truth and choose my way of life-to live with God or without God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I started to read books on different religions except Islam. I had never thought that Islam was a religion worth studying. It was for me, at that time, a sort of primitive idolatry of the simple mind (how ignorant I was!). I made friends with Christians, with whom I studied the Bible, to come to realize a few years later the existence of God. But then I had to face a dilemma because I could not &#8220;feel&#8221; God at all, in spite of my conviction that he should exist. I tried to pray in church, but in vain. I felt nothing but the absence of God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then studied Buddhism, hoping I would be able to feel God through Zen or Yoga. I found as many things in Buddhism that seemed to be true as I had in Christianity, yet there were many things I could not understand or accept. In my opinion, If God exists, He should be for everyone(59) and the truth should simple and clear to everyone. I could not understand why people should abandon ordinary life to devote themselves to God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was really at a loss for what to do to reach the end of my desperate quest for God. It was then that I met an Algerian Muslim. Born and raised in France, he didn&#8217;t even know how to pray and his life was quite far from the ideal of a Muslim; nevertheless, he had very strong faith in God. However, his belief without knowledge irritated me and made me decide to study Islam. To start with, I bought a French translation of the Qur&#8217;an, but I could not read more than two pages. It seemed so strange and boring. I gave up my effort to understand it alone and went to the mosque in Paris to ask someone to help me. It was a Sunday and there was a lecture for women. The sisters welcomed me warmly. It was my first encounter with practicing Muslim women. To my surprise, I felt myself very much at ease with them, although I&#8217;d always felt myself a stranger in the company of Christians. I started to attend the lecture every weekend and to read a book given to me by one of the Muslim women. Every minute of the lecture and every page of the book were, for me, a revelation, giving me great spiritual satisfaction I&#8217;ve never known before. I had an excited feeling that I was being initiated into the truth. What was wonderful, Subhaanallah (Praise be to Allaah), was my feeling the presence of God very close to me while in the posture of Sajdah (prostration).<br />
__________<br />
(57) Sister Khaula visited the Women&#8217;s Office of The Islamic Guidance Center in Buraidah, Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia on 10/25/1993. She shared this information with other Muslim Sisters in the Office. 1 found it important to share with our Muslim brothers and sisters the Story of Khaula&#8217;s coming to Islam followed by her experience and advice concerning the Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(58) This is the concern of so many people in the World and especially in the West or in countries dominated by Western culture. People become &#8220;workaholic&#8221; to keep up with more and more of what they want to have. The secondary things of today are the necessities of tomorrow! The Medium way described by the Creator, Allah, is ignored except by the few.(Dr.S. As-Saleh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(59) Allah is the God of everyone. This thought translates that God must be one. There is no nationalistic belonging to God! Being the God of everyone, He does not command some people to worship Him alone while at the same time makes it permissible for others to set up rivals with Him in worship. This means that His worship must be one and that it is not up to us to define this type of worship. The way of worship belongs to the One and Only One True God, Allah. This constitutes His religion and He had named this way: Islam.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Khula&#8217;s Story with the Hijab :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Two years ago when I embraced Islam in France, the polemic around the wearing of the hijab at school was very hot. The majority of people thought it was against the principle of the public school which should keep its neutrality towards the religion. I, who was not yet Muslim then, could hardly understand why they were worried over such a tiny thing as a small scarf put on the head of Muslim students&#8230;but, apparently, French people who had faced the serious problem of the increasing non-employment rate and the insecurity in big cities became nervous over the immigration of workers from Arab countries. They felt aggrieved by the sight of the hijab in their town and in their school.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Arab countries, on the other hand, a great wave of coming back of the hijab was being observed especially among the young generation, against the expectation, shared by some Arab people and the most of Western people, of its passing away from the scene as Westenerization took root.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic revival symbolized by the current resurgence of the hijab is often considered as an attempt of Arab Muslims to restore their pride and identity which have been repeatedly undermined by colonization and economic retardation. For Japanese people, the actual adherence of Arab people to Islam may seem a kind of conservative traditionalism or antiwesternism, which (the) Japanese knew themselves in the Meiji era at the first contact with the Western culture, and because of which they reacted against the Western life-style and the Western way of dressing. Man has always had a conservative tendency and reacts against which is new and unfamiliar without realizing whether it is good or bad for him. Some people still think the Muslim women insist on wearing hijab which is the &#8220;very symbol of the oppressed situation because they are enslaved by the tradition and are not sufficiently aware of their lamentable situation. If only, they probably think, the movement of the women&#8217;s liberation and independence awakes those women&#8217;s mind, they will take away the hijab.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a naive point of view is shared by the people who have little knowledge of Islam. They, who are so accustomed to the secularism and the religious eclecticism, are simply unable to understand that the teaching of Islam is universal and eternal. Anyway, there are more and more women, beyond the Arab Nationality, all over the world embracing Islam as the true religion and covering the hair. I am but an example of these women. The hijab is surely a strange object for non-Muslim people. For them, the Hijab does not cover the woman&#8217;s hair but also hides something to which they have no access, and it&#8217;s why they feel uneasy. From the outside, effectively, they can never see what is behind the Hijab. I have kept the hijab since I became Muslim in Paris two years ago&#8230;In France, soon after my conversion, I put a scarf, matched in color to the dress, lightly on the head, which people might think a sort of fashion(60). Now in Saudi Arabia, I cover in black all my body from the top of my head till the tip of my toes including my eyes&#8230;At the time I decided to embrace Islam, I did not think seriously about whether I would be able to make the five prayers a day or put the hijab. May be I was afraid that I might find the negative answer, and that would affect my decisions to be Muslim. I had lived in a world which had nothing to do with Islam until I visited, for the first time, the Mosque of Paris. Neither the prayer nor the hijab were yet very familiar to me. I could hardly imagine myself making the prayer and wearing the hijab. But my desire to be a Muslim was too strong to worry about what was waiting for me after my conversion. Indeed, it was a miracle that I embraced Islam, Allah Akbar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In hijab I felt myself different. I felt myself purified and protected. I felt the company of Allah. As a foreigner, I felt sometimes uneasy in a public place, stared by men. With hijab, I was not seen. I found that the hijab sheltered me from such impolite stares. I was also very happy and proud in hijab which is not only the sign of my obedience to Allah but also the manifestation of my faith&#8230;besides, the hijab helps us to recognize each other and to share the feeling of sisterhoods. The hijab has also the advantage of reminding the people around me that God exists and reminding me of being with God(61). It tells me: &#8220;be careful. You should conduct yourself as a Muslim&#8221; As a policeman becomes more conscious of his profession in his uniform, I had a stronger feeling of being Muslim with hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soon, I started to put the hijab before my going out from the house whenever I went to the Mosque. It was a spontaneous and voluntary act and no body forced me to do so. Two weeks after my conversion, I went back to Japan to attend the wedding ceremony of one of my sisters, and decided not to go back to France, Now that I became a Muslim and found that I&#8217;d been looking for, the French literature did not interest me any more. I had rather an increasing passion for learning the Arabic(62).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For me&#8230;it was a trial to live in a small town in Japan, isolated completely from Muslims, But such isolation helped me to intensify my consciousness of being a Muslim. As Islam prohibits the women to disclose the body and to wear clothes which accentuate the body line, I had to abandon many of my clothes such as mini-skirts and half-sleeve blouses. Besides, the Western style fashion does not match with the hijab. I decided, therefore, to make a dress by myself. I asked a friend of mine who knew dress-making to help me, and in two weeks I made a dress with a &#8220;pantaloon&#8221; after the model of a &#8220;Pakistani dress&#8221;. I did not mind people looking at my strange &#8220;fashion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Six months had past since I went back to Japan, when my desire to study the Arabic and Islam in a Muslim country grew so intense that I decided to realize it. I went to Cairo where I knew only one person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was at a loss to find none of my host family spoke English. To my great surprise, furthermore, the lady who took my hand to lead me into the house covered herself all in black from top to toe including the face. Such a &#8220;fashion&#8221; is now familiar to me and I adopt it for myself in Riyadh, but at that time, I was quite surprised at the sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attended once in France a big conference for Muslims, and in that occasion I saw for the first time a woman in black dress with a face-cover. Her presence among the women in colorful dress and scarf was very strange and I said myself: &#8221; there she is, a woman enslaved by the Arabic tradition without knowing the real teaching of Islam&#8221;, because I knew few things of Islam at that time and thought the covering of the face was but an ethnical tradition not founded in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The thought which came to me at the sight of a face-covered woman in Cairo was not very far from that. She&#8217;s exaggerating. Its unnatural&#8230;Her attempts to try to avoid any contact with men seemed also abnormal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sister in black dress told me that my self-made dress was not suitable to go out with. I was not content with her because I thought my dress satisfied the conditions of a Muslima&#8217;s dress&#8230;I bought a black cloth and made a long dress and a long veil called &#8220;Khimar&#8221; which covers the loins and the whole of the arms. I was even ready to cover the face because it seemed good &#8220;to avoid the dust&#8221;, but the sister said there was no need. I should not put the cover-face for such a reason while these sisters put it because they believed it a religious duty. Although most of sisters whom I got acquainted with covered the face, they constituted but a small minority in the whole city of Cairo, and some people apparently got shocked and embarrassed at the sight of black Khimar. Indeed the ordinary more or less westernized young Egyptians tried to keep a distance from those women in Khimar, calling them &#8220;the sisters&#8221;. The men also treated them with a certain respect and a special politeness on the street or in a bus. Those women shared a sisterhood and exchanged the salaam (the Islamic greeting) on the street even without knowing each other… Before my conversion I preferred an active pants-style to a feminine skirt, but the long dress I started to wear in Cairo got to please me very soon. It makes me feel very elegant as if I had become a princess. I feel more relaxed in long dress than in a pantaloon …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My sisters were really beautiful and bright in their Khimar, and a kind of saintliness appeared on their faces&#8230;Every Muslim devotes his life to God. I wonder why people who say nothing about the &#8220;veil&#8221; of the &#8220;Catholic Sisters&#8221; criticize the veil of the Muslima, considering it as a symbol of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; or &#8220;oppression&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave a negative answer when the Egyptian sister told me to wear like this even after my return to Japan….If I show myself in such a long black dress on the street in Japan, people might think me crazy(63). Shocked by my dress, they would not like to listen to me, whatever I say. they would reject Islam because of my appearance, without trying to know its teaching(64). Thus I argued with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sixth months later, however, I got accustomed to my long dress and started to think I may wear it even in Japan. So, just before my return to Japan, I made some dresses with light colors and white Khimars, thinking they would be less shocking than the black one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reaction of the Japanese to my white Khimar was rather good and I met no rejection or mockery at all. They seemed to be able to guess my belonging to a religion without knowing which it is. I heard a young girl behind me whispering to her friend that I was a &#8220;Buddhist nun&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once on a train I sat beside an elderly man who asked me why I was in such a &#8220;strange fashion&#8221;. I explained him that I was a Muslim and in Islam women are commanded to cover the body and their charm so as not to trouble men who are weak to resist this kind of temptation. He seemed very impressed by my explanation, may be because he did not welcome today&#8217;s young girls&#8217; provocative fashion. He left the train thanking me and saying he would have liked to have more time to talk with me on Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father was sorry that I went out even on the hottest day in summer with a long sleeve and a head-cover, but I found the hijab convenient for avoiding the direct sunlight on the head and the neck&#8230; I felt rather uneasy in looking at the white thigh of my younger sister who wore short pants. I&#8217;ve often been embarrassed even before my conversion by the sight of a woman&#8217;s busts and hips traced by the shape of her tight thin clothes. I felt as if I had seen something not to be seen. If such a sight embraces me who is of the same sex, it is not difficult to imagine what effect it would give to men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why hide the body in its natural state?, you may ask. But think it was considered vulgar fifty years ago in Japan to swim in a swimming suit. Now we swim in a bikini without shame. If you swim, however, with a topless, people would say you are shameless, but go to a South-France&#8217;s beach, where many women, young and old, take a sun-bath in a topless. If you go to a certain beach on the west coast in America, the nudists take a sun-bath as naked as when they are born. On the other side, at the medieval times, a knight trembled at a brief sight of a shoe of his adoring lady. It shows the definition of women&#8217;s &#8220;secret part&#8221; can be changed. How you can answer to a nudist if she asks you why you hide yours busts and hips although they are as natural as your hands and face? It is the same for the hijab of a Muslima. We consider all our body except hands and face as private parts because Allah defined it like this(65). Its why we hide them from male strangers. If you keep something secret, it increases in value. Keeping woman&#8217;s body secret increases its charm. Even for the eye of the same sex, the nape of a sister&#8217;s neck is surprisingly beautiful because it is normally covered. If a man loses the feeling of shame and starts to walk naked and excrete and &#8220;make love&#8221; in the presence of other people, he would then become no different than an animal. I think the culture of men started when men knew the sense of shame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Japanese wives (put their) make up only when they go out, never minding at home how they look. But in Islam a wife tries to be beautiful especially for her husband and a husband also tries to have a nice look to please his wife. They have shame even between themselves and towards each other. You may say why we are &#8220;over-sensitive&#8221; to hide the body except the face and the hands so as not to excite men&#8217;s desire, as if a man looks always at a woman with a sexual appetite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the problem of sexual harassment so much talked about recently shows how men are weak to resist to this kind of attraction. We could not expect prevention of sex harassment only by appealing men&#8217;s high morality and self-control&#8230;As a short skirt might be interpreted by men to say: &#8221; if you want me, you may take me&#8221;, a hijab means clearly, &#8220;I am forbidden for you. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three months after coming back from Cairo, I left Japan to Saudi Arabia, and this time with my husband. I had prepared a small black cloth to cover the face with&#8230;Arriving at Riyadh, I found out that not all the women covered the face. The non- Muslim foreigners of course put only a black gown nonchalantly without covering the head, but the Muslim foreigners also uncovered the face(66). As for the Saudi women, all of them seemed to cover perfectly from top to toe. On my first going out, I put the niqab and found out (that) it (was) quite nice. Once accustomed to it, there is no inconvenience. Rather, I felt quite fine as if I became a noble and special person. I felt like the owner of a stolen masterpiece who enjoyed the secret pleasure: I have a treasure that you don&#8217;t know and which you are not allowed to see. A foreigner might see a couple of a fat man and a woman all covered in black who follows him in the street in Riyadh as a caricature of the oppressing-oppressed relationship or the possessing-possessed relationship, but the fact is that the women feel as if they were queens guarded and lead by servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the first several months in Riyadh, I covered only the part beneath the eyes. But when I made a winter cloth, I made on the same occasion a thin eye-cover. My armament then became perfect and my comfort also. Even in a crowd of men, I felt no more uneasiness. I felt as if I had become transparent before the eyes of men. When I displayed the eyes, I felt sometines uneasy when my eyes met a man&#8217;s eye accidentally, especially because the Arab people have very keen eyes. The eye-cover prevents, like black sun-glasses, the visual intrusion of strangers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaula further says that the Muslim woman &#8220;covers herself for her own dignity. She refuses to be possessed by the eyes of a stranger and to be his object. She feels pity for western women who display their private parts as objects f or male strangers. If one observes the hijab from outside, one will never see what is hidden in it. Observing the hijab from the outside and living it from inside are two completely different things. We see different things. This gap explains the gap of understanding Islam. From the outside, Islam looks like a &#8216;prison&#8217; without any liberty. But living inside of it, we feel at peace and freedom and joy that we&#8217;ve never known before&#8230;We chose Islam against the so-called freedom and pleasure. If it is true that Islam is a religion that oppresses the women, why are there so many young women in Europe, in America, and in Japan who abandon their liberty and independence to embrace Islam? I want people to reflect on it. A person blinded because of his prejudice may not see it, but a woman with the hijab is so brightly beautiful as an angel or a saint with self-confidence, calmness, and dignity. Not a slight touch of shade nor trace of oppression is on her face. &#8216;They are blind and cannot see&#8217;, says the Qur&#8217;an about those who deny the sign of Allah, but by what else can we explain this gap on the understanding of Islam between us and those people.&#8221; (3/1993)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman is commanded to cover her hair with a veil when she prays by herself in her house, whereby she is allowed to expose it outside the salât. Therefore, it is the Right of Allâh on us to take an adornment when praying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one has the right to circumambulate the Ka’bah nakedly[1] even if he is alone in darkness where no one can see him. Likewise, it is not permissible for him to pray nakedly even if he is by himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from this point that we understand that, taking of an adornment in salât, is not for the purpose of veiling from people. Doing that is one thing and veiling from people is another thing. Also, it is understood that, an individual may cover in salât that which is permissible for him to expose outside the salât, and a woman may expose in salât that which she covers from the sight of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of the first issue is like that of the shoulders. For verily the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam), has forbidden one of us to pray in one cloth that covers not his shoulders this is because it is the right of salât that one covers his shoulders when he prays though it is permissible for him to expose his shoulders to men outside the salât.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the free woman,[2] it is a must on her to put on a head-covering when praying as the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam),  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“لاَ يَقْبَلُ اللهُ صَلاَةَ حَاءِضٍ إِلاّ بِخِمَارٍ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Allâh the Almighty will not accept the prayer of the woman who reached puberty except with a head-covering”</em> though it is not upon her to put on <strong>Khimâr</strong> [i.e., head-covering] whenever she is with her husband or her family members. That is because it is permissible for her to expose the hidden adornment to them, but it is not permissible for her to expose her head when praying, neither to her family members nor other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the opposite of that are the face, the hands and the feet. It is impermissible for her to expose these parts to foreign men according to the most correct opinion. Contrary to what was before the abrogation of that rule, as a matter of fact, she is only allowed to expose her garment. But as for covering those parts [face, hands and feet] in salât, it is not obligatory according to the consensus of the scholars though they are from the hidden adornment. But as for the ruling of the hands, the <strong>majority</strong> of the scholars like Abu Haneefah, Shafi’ee and others, have agreed upon the permissibility of exposing them in salât. And this is one of the narrations of Imam Ahmad. Also, according to Abu Haneefah it is permissible to expose the feet when praying, and this is the strongest opinion; because Ayesha has considered it from the apparent adornment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] It is agreed upon. And it is emanated in <strong>“Sahih Abi Dawud”</strong> [637] and <strong>“Ir’waa Al-Ghalil”</strong> [275].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] I said: Particularization of Khimâr to the free woman is of the issues that has no proof for it. Rather, the generality of the following Hadith negates that. And look in the previous comment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"> Taken from <strong>“The Veil of The Muslim Women and Her Dress in Salat” &#8211; </strong>by Sheikh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah which has its verification by the Muhaddith of our times Sheikh Muhammad Nasrideen Al-Albaani may Allâh have mercy on them both. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Question posed to <strong>Shaykh &#8216;Uthaymeen</strong>, rahimahullah:<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><br />
</span><span style="color:#333300;">Q. My brother dresses his four year old daughter in a veil and says, &#8220;He who grows up upon something grows old upon it&#8221;, and he tries to force this upon my children.  Whereas I disagree with him in this, and say to him, when they reach their menses.  What is your opinion about this severity by which he has chained the childhood of this child at the age of four?  May Allah reward you with good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. There is no doubt that your brother&#8217;s statement is the common occurance: He who grows up upon something grows old upon it, this is why the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, has ordered the one who reaches the age of seven years to perform the prayer, even though he is not yet responsible for his actions, rather this is an order than he be accustomed to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for a young girl, there is no ruling concerning her private zone, it is not obligatory upon her to cover her face, neck and hands or feet, and it is not befitting that she be forced into this.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whereas if she reaches a stage at which men start to become attracted to her, then she should wear the hijab to prevent trials and evil</span>.  This varies with different women, for there are some who develope quite rapidly, while others are the opposite of this.  Allah is the One Who gives success.</p>
<p><em>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen</em><br />
<em> [Fataawa Manaar al-Islaam: 3/810]</em><br />
From the  book  &#8220;<em>Islamic Fataawa Regarding the Muslim Child&#8221;</em>, page 153</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">maa shaa Allaah this is truly a much needed clarification of the ruling on makeup, about which many are unaware. shaykh al-albaani (rahimahullaah) advises both women and men in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #3: “Is it allowed for the woman to put on make-up if she leaves her house wearing the<em> hijaab</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for the woman who does not wear <em>hijaab</em>, let alone who wears <em>hijaab</em>, to use the makeup of the disbeliever, the make-up of the rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah). </strong>When were you aware of some women’s adornment called by a name for which Allaah did not send down an authority: ‘make-up’? This is a word that we don’t know, not us nor your forefathers from before. Rather, it is a foreign word expressing an adornment for the rebellious and disobedient women of Europe; and our women – except those of them whom Allaah protects – unfortunately imitate decorating themselves with this adornment which the Islamic society is being affected by, namely make-up. So it is not permissible for the woman. And this reality is one of the strange ironies: in the road we see a woman wearing a decent <em>hijaab</em> (but) I don’t say the Islamically legislated <em>hijaab</em>; she ties what they call the ‘<em>ishaarb</em>’ – or <em>khimaar</em> which is the (correct) Arabic word – covering her hair, her neck and so on, but she has face powder and lipstick on. This (wearing the <em>hijaab</em>) is against this (wearing make-up): two contradictory, conflicting matters that do not go together. What is the reason (for this type of occurrence)? It is one of two things: either ignorance and heedlessness of the Islamically legislated ruling or it is due to the women’s following of the temptations of <em>shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we firstly remind the women who suffer from this make-up. Then secondly, we remind the guardians of women such as a father or a husband or a brother, due to the fact that (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Everyone of you is a shepherd and everyone of you is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock-’[1] to the end of the <em>hadeeth</em>. Thus, the Arabic or general proverb states: ‘The horse is from the horseman.’ So you, the husband of the woman, it is not permissible for you to allow her to go out in this manner which puts to trial the middle-aged men, let alone the young men! And you, O man, O father, O brother, are supposed to be very jealous. Why? Because the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to say: ‘<strong>A <em>duyyooth </em>will not enter Paradise</strong>.’[2] Why? Who is a <em>duyyooth</em>? He is the one who does not guard his womenfolk jealously.”</p>
