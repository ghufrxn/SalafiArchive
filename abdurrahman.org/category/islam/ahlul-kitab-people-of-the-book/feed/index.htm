<p><br /><strong>إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلنَّصَـٰرَىٰ وَٱلصَّـٰبِـِٔينَ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَـٰلِحًۭا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve</strong> (Suratul Baqarah 2:62)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">English &#8211; Tafsir Ibn Kathir</h2>



<p>Faith and doing Righteous Deeds equals Salvation in all Times</p>



<p>Allah says;</p>



<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَارَى وَالصَّابِيِينَ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p>



<p>Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians (Sabi&#8217;in), whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>



<p>After Allah described the condition &#8211; and punishment &#8211; of those who defy His commands, fall into His prohibitions and transgress set limits by committing prohibited acts, He stated that the earlier nations who were righteous and obedient received the rewards for their good deeds. This shall be the case, until the Day of Judgment. Therefore, whoever follows the unlettered Messenger and Prophet shall acquire eternal happiness and shall neither fear from what will happen in the future nor become sad for what has been lost in the past.</p>



<p>Similarly, Allah said,</p>



<p>أَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَأءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p>



<p>No doubt! Verily, the Awliya of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. (10:62)</p>



<p>The angels will proclaim to the dying believers, as mentioned,</p>



<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـيِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلَا تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p>



<p>Verily, those who say:&#8221;Our Lord is Allah (alone),&#8221; and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying):&#8221;Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!&#8221; (41:30)<br />The Meaning of Mu&#8217;min, or Believer</p>



<p>Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn Abbas, about,<br /><br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَارَى وَالصَّابِيِينَ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ<br />(Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day) that Allah revealed the following Ayah afterwards,</p>



<p>وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الاِسْلَـمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ</p>



<p><strong>And whoever seeks religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers. </strong>(3:85).</p>



<p><strong>This statement by Ibn Abbas indicates that Allah does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muhammad that is, after Allah sent Muhammad. Before that, every person who followed the guidance of his own Prophet was on the correct path, following the correct guidance and was saved.</strong><br /></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-30806beb3e73bb9debf8cada81e8a833"><strong>Why the Jews were called `Yahud</strong></p>



<p>The Jews are the followers of Prophet Musa, who used to refer to the Tawrah for judgment. Yahud is a word that means,</p>



<p>`repenting&#8217;, just as Musa said,<br />إِنَّا هُدْنَـا إِلَيْكَ<br />(We have Hudna (we repent, go back and return) unto You), (7:156).</p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9bf0f6e8e47c6c89b003334d9c77acf6"><strong>Why the Christians were called Nasara</strong></p>



<p>Allah said;</p>



<p>مَنْ أَنصَارِى إِلَى اللَّهِ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ اللَّهِ</p>



<p>&#8220;Who will be my helpers in Allah&#8217;s cause&#8221; Al-Hawariyyun said:&#8221;We are the helpers of Allah.&#8221; (61:14)</p>



<p>It was said that;</p>



<p>they were called `Nasara&#8217;, because they inhabited a land called An-Nasirah (Nazareth), as Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Abbas were reported to have said, Allah knows best.<br />Nasara is certainly plural for Nasran.</p>



<p>When Allah sent Muhammad as the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger to all of the Children of Adam, mankind was required to believe in him, obey him and refrain from what he prohibited them; those who do this are true believers. The Ummah of Muhammad was called `Mu&#8217;minin&#8217; (believers), because of the depth of their faith and certainty, and because they believe in all of the previous Prophets and matters of the Unseen.<br /></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7d09a938eb2a9ee1c36bd806243e374e"><strong>The Sabi&#8217;un or Sabians</strong></p>



<p>There is a difference of opinion over the identity of the Sabians.</p>



<p>Sufyan Ath-Thawri said that Layth bin Abu Sulaym said that Mujahid said that,</p>



<p>&#8220;The Sabians are between the Majus, the Jews and the Christians. They do not have a specific religion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Similar is reported from Ibn Abi Najih.</p>



<p>Similar statements were attributed to Ata and Sa`id bin Jubayr.</p>



<p>They (others) say that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are a sect among the People of the Book who used to read the Zabur (Psalms), others say that they are a people who worshipped the angels or the stars.</p>



<p>It appears that the closest opinion to the truth, and Allah knows best, is Mujahid&#8217;s statement and those who agree with him like Wahb bin Munabbih, that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are neither Jews nor Christians nor Majus nor polytheists. Rather, they did not have a specific religion that they followed and enforced, because they remained living according to their Fitrah (instinctual nature). This is why the idolators used to call whoever embraced Islam a `Sabi&#8217;, meaning, that he abandoned all religions that existed on the earth.</p>



<p>Some scholars stated that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are those who never received a message by any Prophet.</p>



<p>And Allah knows best</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation of Verse 5 of Sooratul Faatiha</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ihdinā aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;the path&#8221; (aṣ-Ṣirāṭ):</strong></span> Regarding this word, there are two permissible recitations, one with the Arabic letter س (sīn) as in السِّرَاط and another with the letter ص (ṣād) as it is here in the verse: الصِّرَاط . The meaning of <em>aṣ-Ṣirāṭ</em> is the way or path. The meaning of &#8220;<strong>Guide us&#8221;</strong> refers to the guidance of showing and directing to the right path as well as the guidance of granting success. So, by reciting, <strong>&#8220;Guide us to the straight path&#8221;</strong>, you are asking Allah for <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> (which is the guidance of direction) and <strong>righteous action</strong> (which is the guidance of success in following the knowledge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;straight&#8221; (al-Mustaqīm):</strong></span> This means the correct path with no crookedness or deviation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 5:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from this verse is the concept of mankind’s resorting back to Allah. After requesting Allah’s help in fulfilling his worship in the previous verse, mankind now asks Allah to guide them to the straight path. There must be sincerity solely to Allah in worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8221; and help must be sought in fulfilling and strengthening this worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Also, one must follow the Islamic legislation and this is indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; because the straight path is none other than the complete legislation with which the messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has come with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point from this verse is that the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an is shown in that there is no preposition after <strong>&#8220;Guide us&#8221;</strong> in the Arabic text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[TN: The author here refers to the original Arabic text. The verse would literally be translated as “Guide us the straight path” without the added English preposition “to.”]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is made so that the verse would contain both types of seeking guidance: the guidance of knowledge and direction, and the guidance of success and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This first type</strong></span> is only the directing to and showing the straight path, and Allah guides all of mankind with this meaning of guidance as in his statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The month of Ramadan in which the Qur&#8217;an was revealed (as) guidance for mankind</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second type of guidance</span></strong> is the granting of success along with the first type of guidance and the following of the Islamic legislation as Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is the book, wherein there is no doubt, a means of guidance for the <em>Muttaqīn</em> (those who are constantly and fearfully conscious of Allah)</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second type of guidance may not be achieved by some people as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And as for (the people of) Thamūd, we guided them (i.e. showed them the right way), but they preferred blindness over guidance.</span> [Sūrah al-Fuṣṣilat, 41:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here,<strong> &#8220;we guided them&#8221;</strong> means: We made clear to them the truth and directed them to follow it but they chose not to accept the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another benefit we get from this verse is that the “path” is of two types: one straight and all others crooked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever is in accordance with the truth, it is the straight path as Allah tells the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) to say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ هَذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight path so follow it and do not follow (other) paths for they will separate you away from his (Allah’s) path</span>. [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anything that opposes the truth is a crooked path.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation of Verses 6 &amp; 7  of Sooratul Faatiha</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those you bestowed grace upon</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The path of those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna An’amta ‘alayhim)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is connected to the previous verse and provides further clarification of &#8220;the straight path&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the same ones mentioned in the statement of Allah in another part of the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ  وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَئِكَ رَفِيقًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever obeys Allah and the messenger, then they will be with those Allah bestowed grace upon of the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. And what excellent companions they are!</span> [Sūrah an-Nisā, 4:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Not of those who earned anger upon themselves&#8221; (ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim): </strong>Such as the followers of Judaism and anyone else who knows the truth yet refuses to act according to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;nor of those who are astray&#8221; (wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn): </strong>Such as the Christians before the mission of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) began. It also refers to anyone who works contrary to the truth, choosing to remain ignorant of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the word &#8220;upon them&#8221; (‘alayhim), it has two acceptable recitations from the seven forms: one is with a (ḍammah) on the letter هُ (hā) making the reading عَلَيْهُم (‘alayhum) and the other reading is the common one with a (kasrah) on the هِ (hā) which is read as عَلَيْهِم (‘alayhim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to know that any different form of recitation that is not within the copies of the Qur&#8217;an that most people have, this different recitation, even though it is permissible, should not be read among common people who may not be aware of the different ways of reciting. This is due to three reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Even the common people, although unaware of the different forms of recitation, consider this Qur&#8217;an to be something amazing and honorable. Their hearts are filled with its greatness and respect for it. If they began to hear it read sometimes one way and then other times a different way, then this may result in the Qur&#8217;an being lower with them from the high status it was once given. This is only because they are not aware of the various recitations and therefore cannot distinguish between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If someone recites with the different forms of recitation, he may be accused of making mistakes and not knowing how to recite. This is because he recites in a way that is unknown to most people. So, this reader, even though may be correct, is then spoken about in a negative way amongst the majority of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Even if a common person gives someone reciting in a different way the benefit of the doubt and believes that he knows what he recites, then such a person may begin to blindly follow the one reciting in the various ways of reading. So, perhaps he, the common person, may then mistakenly recite a way different from any of the permissible ways believing it to be one of the seven allowable recitations of the Qur&#8217;an. This would then be a form of distortion and corruption. For this reason, ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه), one of the prophet’s companions, said, “<strong>Speak to people according to what they know, (otherwise) would you like that they (unknowingly) deny what Allah and his messenger say (because you confuse them)?”</strong> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī as notes to another ḥadīth (no. 127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه ), another companion of Prophet Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), said, “<strong>You will never speak to any people with something that they cannot comprehend except that it will become a Fitnah (negative trial or tribulation) for some of them</strong>.” [Recorded by Muslim (no. 14)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whenever ‘Umar Ibn al-Khaṭṭāb heard Hishām Ibn Ḥakīm recite a verse that he had never heard recited in that way before, he (‘Umar) dragged him to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and informed him of this. The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Hishām:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اِقْرَأ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Recite</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) told ‘Umar to recite and afterwards again said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was (also) revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 4992) and Muslim (no. 818)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an was revealed in seven different dialects and the people used to recite in all of them until ‘Uthmān gathered the people together upon one common recitation because they were beginning to differ and dispute over each other’s recitations. He feared that the differences would become severe, dividing the people. So, he gathered them all together upon one recitation which was the dialect of the Quraysh tribe because the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), upon whom the Qur&#8217;an was revealed, was sent from and among them. The other forms of recitation were somewhat forgotten by most people. So, if ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) did what he did to another companion, then what about an ordinary person who hears you recite in a way different from the familiar copy of the Qur&#8217;an he has?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thanks to Allah, the scholars have always been in agreement that it is not compulsory for people to recite in all the different permissible ways. If a person remains reciting upon one particular recitation, there is no problem with this. So, avoid problems and what could lead to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verses 6 and 7:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from these two verses is the mentioning of specific descriptive details after a general description. This is from the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; – this is a general description and &#8220;<strong>The path of those you bestowed grace upon</strong>&#8221; is a more specific and detailed description of the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefit in mentioning something general and then afterwards more relevant details is that when a person hears of something general that could benefit him, he might eagerly anticipate more details and a clearer explanation. Then, after becoming aware of the detailed descriptions, he is ready to accept them and anxiously hopes to obtain what is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another benefit is the explanation that the people upon whom Allah has bestowed his favors and grace, they are the same ones who are upon the straight path as a result of this grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point we learn from this verse is that the blessing of guidance, with which some people have been favored, is directly from Allah alone; it is a pure favor from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. From the verse, we understand that all of mankind is of either one of three categories: those upon whom Allah has bestowed his grace, those who have earned anger upon themselves, or those who are astray. Each of these categories has already been explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ways leading away from the straight path are either <strong>ignorance</strong> or <strong>arrogant disobedience</strong>.The ones who were taken away from the straight path due to arrogance and disobedience, they are those who earned anger upon themselves and the head of this group are the followers of Judaism. The other group, those who have deviated from the straight path due to ignorance, they are any people who do not know the truth, the main ones among these being the Christians. However, this was their (the Christian’s) situation before the advent of the last prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Now that the prophet’s mission has been established and completed, they have known the truth but in spite of that, opposed it. So, they and the Jews both have become the same – all of them are those who have earned anger upon themselves (if they do not repent and accept Allah’s religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. These last two verses also illustrate the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an in that the expression used to refer to those who have earned anger upon themselves, مَغْضُوْب (Maghḍūb), is in the Arabic form (according to Arabic morphology) known as the مَفْعُوْل (maf’ūl) – an Arabic conjugal form that indicates that the anger upon them has already begun and is continuously occurring from Allah and from his close allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another point we learn from these verses is that the severest type of misguided group is placed first, then the next in severity. Allah mentioned those who earned anger upon themselves before those who are astray because the first are more severe in opposition to the truth than the ones astray and misguided. Opposing something while being fully aware of it is much harder to return from than opposing something simply because of being ignorant of it.</p>

</div>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[6] Question</strong></span>:</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">How do we combine between the two ayahs:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</strong></span></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever seeks other than Islaam as a Religion, it will never be accepted from him”</strong></span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan 3:85] and</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالصَّابِئُونَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong></span></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, those who have believed and those who were Jews, Sabians, and Christians who believed in Allaah and the Last Day and do righteous deeds – there is no fear upon them nor do they worry.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah 5:69]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[6] Answer by Imam al-Albaani </strong>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction between these two ayahs as the question suggests. And this is because the verse about Islaam (3:85) came after the Message of Islaam was conveyed to those people whom Allah described in the second ayah as: “<strong>There is no fear upon them nor do they worry</strong>.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions amongst them the Sabians. When the word Sabian is mentioned what quickly comes to mind is a reference to those who worship the stars. However, in reality, this term applies to all people that fall into Shirk after having been from among the adherents of Tawheed. So the Sabians were once proponents of pure Monotheism, but then they were subjected to polytheism and worshipping of stars. So the ones mentioned in this verse refer to the believers amongst them, the adherents of Tawheed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Before the Message of Islaam came, these people were like the Jews and Christians, whom were also mentioned in the same list as the Sabians. So this refers to those among them that were practicing their Religion at their time. They were from among the believers of whom: “There is no fear upon them nor do they worry.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Allaah sent Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the Religion of Islaam, the Message of Islaam was conveyed to these three types of people – the Jews, the Christians and the Sabians. And so nothing else but Islaam was accepted from them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah’s statement: “<strong>Whoever seeks other than Islaam as a Religion</strong>” refers to after Islaam was conveyed to him upon the tongue of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and after the Message of Islaam was passed on to him. So at that point, nothing other than Islaam was acceptable</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who died before the advent of the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) or those who are alive today on the face of the earth but yet the Message of Islaam has not reached them or the Message of Islaam has reached them but in a manner that is distorted from its true and original state – as I have mentioned in some occasions about the Qadiyanis, for example, who today have spread throughout Europe and America, claiming Islaam, however this Islaam, which they claim to be upon is not from Islaam at all, since they believe that prophets will come after the final Prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) – then these people, among the Europeans and Americans that have been called to the Qadiyani form of Islam while the true Message of Islaam was not conveyed to them, they fall into two categories:</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category contains those who remained upon their prior (pure) Religion and held steadfast onto it. This is how the ayah: “there is no fear upon them nor do they worry” should be understood.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category consists of those who deviated from this Religion – as is the case with many Muslims today – so the proof is established against them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those whom the Call to Islaam has not been conveyed to at all – whether after Islaam came or before it, such people will get a special treatment in the Hereafter. And it is by Allaah sending them a messenger that will test them, just as the people were tested in the worldly life. So whoever answers the call of this messenger on the Day of Judgement and obeys him will enter Paradise. And whoever disobeys him will enter the Hellfire.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[See Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (2468)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Covenant (<em>al-Meethaaq</em>) is the weighty, emphatic covenant; and Allaah-the Most High-took this Covenant from everyone to whom He gave the Book, and whom He taught knowledge to; that they should clarify to the people whatever they are in need of from that which Allaah taught him, and that they should not hide that, nor be miserly with them regarding it &#8211; particularly if they ask him about it, or when something occurs which necessitates that. So in such a situation it is obligatory upon everyone who possesses knowledge that he clearly explains it to the people, and clarifies the truth from falsehood. So as for those guided to correctness by Allaah, then they carry this out in the most complete manner, and they teach the people that which Allaah has taught them, seeking the Pleasure of their Lord, and out of compassion for the creation, and from fear of the sin of hiding the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who were given the Scripture, from the Jews and the Christians and their like, then they cast this agreement and this covenant behind their backs. They took no notice of it. So they hid the truth and they put forth falsehood. They boldly violated the prohibitions laid down by Allaah; and they neglected the rights of Allaah and the rights of the creation. Through concealing the truth they purchased a paltry gain- which is what they acquire, if they acquire anything, from positions of authority and trivial wealth; from their lowly ones- from those who follow their desires, and who give precedence to their desires over the truth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So evil is that which they bought</strong></span>]]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">since it is the most wretched exchange. They turned away from clarifying the truth, which is something which brings about eternal bliss, and religious and worldly benefits – the most tremendous and exalted goals. So they only chose that which is lowly and despicable over that which is lofty and precious because of their wretchedness and degradation, and because they are not fitting for anything other than that which they were created for.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The second question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">7807</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q 2: Is the call for rapprochement between religions (Islam &#8211; Christianity &#8211; Judaism) a legitimate one? Is it permissible for a Muslim believer to support it? I heard that this is done by some scholars in Al-Az-har and other Islamic institutions. Is the call for rapprochement betweenAhl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and theShiites, Druze, Al-Isma`iliyyah, Al-Nusayriyyah and such sects useful for Muslims? Is reconciliation between them possible, although all of these sects entail Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), offense to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and hostility towards Islam and Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah? Is this rapprochement permissible according to Shari`ah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: <span style="color:#ff0000;">First</span>: </b>the roots of Iman (faith) which Allah has revealed to His Messengers in the Holy Books: Tawrah (Torah), Injil (Gospel), Zabur (Psalms), and the Qur&#8217;an; and which the Messengers Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), &#8216;Isa </span>(<span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Jesus</span></span>),<span class="HarfBody"> and other Messengers (peace be upon them) called to, are all the same. The former ones of them told the latter about them; and the latter confirmed what the former said, even if they differed in the branches, each according to the circumstances of their own era and the benefit of the people at their time. This is the wisdom and mercy of Allah, as He says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>The Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).</em>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">And those who believe in Allâh and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers), We shall give them their rewards; and Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span></em>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 152). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />And (remember) when Allâh took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#ff6600;">Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allâh), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him</span></em>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allâh said: <em><span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?&#8221; They said: &#8220;We agree.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious: those who turn away from Allâh’s Obedience).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism &#8211; worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">After mentioning Ibrahim&#8217;s call for Tawhid (monotheism) and the Messengers who were contemporary with him, Allah says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al-Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) who are not disbelievers therein.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />They are those whom Allâh had guided.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) applied this practically when he concluded a peace treaty with Quraysh in the year of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span>with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah </span>before the Battle of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Khandaq </span>(the Trench) and the Battle of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Khaybar, </span>and with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians of Rome </span>in the Battle of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This had the greatest impact and the most wonderful results; peace spread, lives were saved, the truth prevailed in the world, people embraced Islam in crowds, and everyone began to work for the benefit of this world and the Hereafter. Thus, the result was prosperity, power, and the spread of Islam and peace.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">History and reality are the strongest proof of this for the impartial and sane people who are free from fanaticism and sophistry. Therein is indeed a reminder for those who have a heart or listen heedfully. Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path. He is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs.</span></p>

His evil spread widely; many sects were deceived by him, so they turned to Kufr after having embraced Islam; and controversy spread among Muslims. Thus, the call for rapprochement between such sects and the Muslims is useless and futile, as they resemble<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>in their misguidance, Kufr, envy towards the Muslims and conspiring against them, even if their ways and intentions are different. Thus, they apply the same policy of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>with the Muslims. For some reason, a group of Egyptian Azhari scholars attempted to make this rapprochement with the Iranian, Rafidi scholars of Qum after the Second World War.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Some of the sincere great scholars were deceived by this call, as their hearts were too pure and they were inexperienced in life. So, they issued a magazine called &#8220;Al-Taqrib&#8221;. However, the truth was uncovered soon after, and this call ended in failure. This is not strange, as the inclinations are different, the ideas are distinct, and the &#8216;Aqidahs are contrasting. There is no way to reconcile the contraries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[From &#8220;<em>Saheehus-Seeratin-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp.80-81), Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; verified edition of al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; &#8220;<em>as-Seeratun-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216;.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja`ee, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went off one day, and I was with him, until we entered a synagogue of the Jews (in al-Madeenah, on a festival day of theirs, and they disliked our entering upon them), and he said (to them):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">O assembly of Jews! Show me twelve men who will bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and Allaah will remove from every Jew beneath the sky the Anger which He has upon them</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; He said: So they remained silent; no one responded to him. Then he repeated it, but no one responded to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You have refused, but, by Allaah ! I am indeed ‘al-Haashir’</strong> (the Prophet after whom the people will be gathered), and I am <strong>‘al-`Aaqib’</strong> (the final Prophet), and I am<strong> ‘an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa’</strong> (the chosen Prophet): whether you believe or reject the truth</span>.</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he departed, and I was with him, until (when) we had almost left, a man behind us said: &#8220;Stay as you are, O Muhammad!&#8217; Then that man said: &#8221; What sort of man do you people know me to be amongst you, O company of Jews?&#8217; They said: &#8220;By Allaah! We do not know there to be any man amongst us who knows Allaah&#8217;s Scripture better than you; nor who has better understanding of the religion than you; nor than your father before you; nor than your grandfather before your father.&#8217; He said: &#8220;Then I testify for him, by Allaah, that he is indeed the Prophet of Allaah, whom you find in the Tawraat [Torah].” They said: &#8220;You have lied!&#8217; Then they rebutted his saying, and they said evil things about him, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You people have lied. Your saying will never be accepted. Just now you were praising him with the good that you were praising him with; but when he believed you called him a liar, and said what you have said. Your saying will never be accepted</strong></span>.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So we departed, and we were three: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), myself, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah -the Most High- sent down regarding him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Do you see: if this Qur·aan is from Allaah, and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Israa&#8217;eel testifies to its like, and believes in it; and you haughtily reject it; then Allaah does not guide the wrongdoing Disbelievers&#8221;</span></strong>  [ Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Reported by Ahmad (6/25), and the additions are his; and by al-Haakim (3/415-416), and he said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of the two Shaikhs&#8217;! And adhDhahabee agreed with him! But it is only to the standard of Muslim, since al-Bukhaaree did not report the narrations of Safwaan ibn `Amr except in his &#8220;al-Adabul-Mufrad&#8217;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>IMAAM AL-BUKHAAREE’S -rahimahullaah- NARRATION:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree narrated (no.3329): from Anas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abdullaah ibn Salaam heard of the arrival of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) at AlMadeenah, so he came to him and said: &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which nobody but a Prophet will know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;What is the first of the signs of the Hour? And what will be the first food, which the people of Paradise will eat? And on account of what does a child resemble its father; and on account of what does a child resemble its maternal uncles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «Jibreel has just informed me of them.» He said: `Abdullaah said: &#8220;He is the enemy to the Jews from amongst the Angels.&#8217; Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«As for the first of the signs of the Hour, then it will be a fire, which gathers the people from the east to the west. As for the first food which the people of Paradise will eat, then it will be the extra lobe of the liver of the fish. As for the resemblance of the child, then when the man has intercourse with the woman and his semen outstrips the fluid of the woman, then the child will resemble him; and if her fluid outstrips, then the resemblance will be towards her.» </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Then he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The Jews are a people who are great liars: if they know about my Islaam before you ask them, then they will lie about me to you.&#8217; So the Jews came, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam entered the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What sort of a man is `Abdullaah ibn Salaam amongst you?» They said: &#8220;He is the most knowledgeable one of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable one from amongst us; and he is the best one of us, and the son of the best one of us.&#8217; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What would you think if `Abdullaah were to accept Islaam?» They said: &#8220;May Allaah preserve him from that.&#8217; So `Abdullaah came out to them and said: &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; So they said: &#8220;He is the most evil one of us, and the son of the most evil one of us&#8217;, and they spoke against him&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF `ABDULLAAH IBN SALAAM -radiyallaahu `anhu:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn Salaam ibn al-Haarith, al-Israa·eelee, Aboo Yoosuf. He was previously a confederate of Banoo `Awf ibn al-Khazraj. He accepted Islaam when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came to al-Madeenah. He was present at the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), and the battles after it. He was present with `Umar at the conquest of Jerusalem, and at alJaabiyah. He died in al-Madeenah in 43 H. <span style="color:#999999;">[[ ref. &#8220;Tahdheebut-Tahdheeb&#8217; of al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr]]</span> Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) bore witness that he will be a person of Paradise, as reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3812) and Muslim (no. 2483) from Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; who said: &#8220;I never heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say about anyone who still walked upon the earth that he was a person of Paradise, except `Abdullaah ibn Salaam. He said: And this Aayah came down concerning him:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And a witness from the children of Israa·eel testifies to its like</span>&#8220;</strong> [Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee reported (no. 3804) from Mu`aadh ibn Jabal -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will be the tenth of ten in Paradise</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [ Declared &#8220;Saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;I begin to write:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah. We praise Him, and seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah, Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomever Allaah guides cannot be misguided, and whomever He leads astray cannot be guided. I testify that there is no true God worthy of being worshipped except Allaah, alone, without partner or associate. I further testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).1 May Allaah’s salaah and salaam also be granted to the Prophet’s pure family and to all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allaah [by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He forbade] as He should be feared [obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always] and die not except in a state of Islaam&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:102)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb [2] [Allaah], Who created you from a single person [Adam] and from him [Adam] He created his wife [Eve], and from them both He created many men and women. And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual [rights] and [do not cut the relations of] the wombs [kinship]. Surely, Allaah is ever an All-Watcher over you.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:1)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him, and speak [always] the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great success.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab (33:70-71)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most truthful speech is that of Allaah&#8217;s Book [the Qur’aan] and that the best of guidance is that of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The worst of evils are the muhdathaat (newly-invented matters [in the deen] [3], and every innovated matter (in the deen) is a bid’ah; every bid’ah is a dalaalah (misguidance), and every dalaalah is in the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hear nowadays a strange call by organized groups involving some Christians, Jews, and “Muslim” intellectuals calling for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>wahdatul adyaan</strong></span>. They claim that these three religions stand for the same belief that there is One God and should unite in their call for the implementation of great moral values. Some of those involved call for the establishment of centers containing churches, synagogues, and massaajid side by side, printing the Qur’aan, the Bible, and the Torah in one binding, etc. In the name of defending Islaam against political and media distortions in the West, some organizations are compromising the basics of the Isamic creed through what is called “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bridging the Faiths</strong></span>.”[4] This is a very dangerous call because it mixes the truth with falsehood and thus practically implies the elimination of the truth perfected in the deen of Islaam. The Christians and Jews want the Muslims to be like them. That is why they support this deceptive call for “unity”. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) spoke of their attempts and called the Muslims to be aware of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another).</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:89)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the fundamental beliefs in Islaam is the kufr (unbelief) of the Christians and Jews because they reject the Qur’aan and the message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to them. They have also altered their books in such a way that it permits or even enjoins worship of other than Allaah and (or) the association of partners with Him in worship. <strong><span style="color:#333300;">Any Muslim who doubts their kufr is a kaafir himself.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Mulsims who do not understand certain texts from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah and may be easily deceived by the call for “unity of religions”. It is important to know that if certain texts are not clear to some they are clear to others from those who are firm in the knowledge of the deen.[5] Consequently, nothing stays unclear for those who are seeking the truth and not just following vain desires. For example, some may understand that the following text is evidence that the Jews and Christians are not kufaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily! Those who believe and those Jews and Christians, and Sabians,[6] whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, and work righteousness shall have their reward with their Rabb [Allaah], on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:62)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam bin Taymeeyah said: “The aayah (above) tells about the followers of these four unaltered milal (Paths) before abrogation [by the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s complete message.].” [7] It, therefore, addresses those who believed in tawheed and followed the Path of Allaah as was known to them. Those who continued on this belief and did not alter the Scriptures must follow the Qur’aan and the Message of Islaam as explained by Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Furthermore, the order of the explained, رضي الله عنهما above aayah, as ibn ‘Abbaas was canceled by aayah 3:85, which states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3: 85)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the alterations in their religion, most of the People of the Book turned kufaar and few remained on the original teachings of the Torah and the Gospel. This is clear in the Qur’anic texts where Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And had the People of the Scriptures believed,[8] it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith,[9] but most of them are al-Faasiqoon [Disobedient to Allaah and His Messenger, and rebellious against Allaah&#8217;s Command].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:110)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the above description, Allaah (Azza wa Jal) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Not all of them are alike; a party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the aayaat of Allaah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in Allaah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they hasten in good works; and they are among the righteous</span></em>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:112-114)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This party includes those who held to the original Scriptures before they were abrogated by Qur’aan and sunnah. They were on the right religion enjoining tawheed and forbidding shirk, just as Allaah described the believing followers of Mûsa (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And of the people of Mûsa there is a community who lead [the men] with truth and establish justice [i.e. judge men with truth and justice].</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf (7:159)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever held to these qualities amongst them (i.e. to the true revelations), prior to the advent of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), was a believer. The believers from the People of the Book who accepted the Prophet&#8217;s Message of Islaam will receive a double reward:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And who believe in that which has been sent down [revealed] to you [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]10 and in that which was sent down before you [the Torah and the Gospel, etc.] and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:4)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allaah and in that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allaah. They do not sell the aayaat of Allaah for a little price, for them is a reward with their Rabb [Allaah]. Surely, Allaah is Swift in account.</span></em>[11] [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:199)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those to whom We gave the Scripture [i.e. the Torah and the Injeel etc.] before it,—they believe in it [the Qur&#8217;aan]. And when it is recited to them, they say: “We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Rabb. Indeed even before it we have been from those who submit themselves to Allaah in Islaam as Muslims [like ‘Abdullaah bin Saalam and Salmaan Al-Faarisee, etc.].”These will be given their reward twice over, because they are patient, and repel evil with good, and spend [in charity] out of what we have provided for them.</span> </em>[Qur’aan¸ Soorat Al-Qasas (28:52-54)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Three persons will get their reward twice [i.e. a double reward]. [One is] a person who has a slave girl and he educates her properly and teaches her good manners properly [without violence] and then manumits and marries her. Such a person will get a double reward. [Another is] a believer from the People of the Scriptures who has been a true believer [in his Prophet],* and then he believes in the Prophet [Muhammad-صلى الله عليه و سلم]. Such a person will receive a double reward. [The third is] a slave man who observes Allaah&#8217;s rights and is sincere to his master [and observes the rights of his master]*.”</em></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan also mentions the case of believing monks and priests who followed the true teachings of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) and who believe in the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and would love to be from the ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers [Muslims] the Jews and pagans; and you will find the nearest amongst them in love to the believers those who say: “We are Nassara (Christians).” [13] That is because amongst them there are priests and monks, and they are not proud. And when they [who call themselves Christians] listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger [(صلى الله عليه و سلم)], you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say: “Our Rabb! We believe, so write us down among the witnesses [Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his nation]. And why should we not believe in Allaah and in that which has come to us of the Truth [tawheed]? And we wish that our Rabb will admit us [in al-Jannah on the Day of Resurrection] along with the righteous people [Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his So, Allaah rewarded them .[رضي الله عنهم companions with Gardens under which rivers flow [in al-Jannah], they will abide therein forever, because of what they said. Such is the reward of good-doers.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5: 82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayaat cited above are some of the qualities of the believing Christians, who believed in the true Message of Jesus (a’leihis-salaam). In our times, any “Christian” who holds to similar beliefs and hears of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) must accept him and accept that which he is entrusted with (i.e. Islaam). Then he is a believer. If they know about Islaam, they must declare their acceptance of it unless it will result in their death. They are called then to migrate to daarul-Islaam if they are able to.Otherwise they are called to exert that which they are able to, and Allaah knows best. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in case he never heard of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), then his case rests with Allaah15 in light of Allaah’s saying: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Israa’, 17: 15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some Muslims say: “But Allaah (Azza wa Jal) had mentioned in the Qur’aan that there are churches, synagogues, and monasteries where the Name of Allaah is mentioned. So, how can we understand this in light of the above explanations about the People of the Book?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah. The aayah in the Qur’aan where the above places are mentioned is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid, wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would assuredly have been pulled down.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The masaajid are the places where the Name of Allaah was and still being mentioned. When they were on their original faith, the People of the Book mentioned the Name of Allaah in their places of worship. However, because of the alterations in their religions, shirk in worship was introduced, even though some of them may mention the Name of Allaah. Hence, their places of worship cannot be considered as boyoutullaah (Houses of Allaah), because they committed kufr and their places contain a wide range of blasphemous symbols (pictures, crosses, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam ibnul Qayyim</strong> said: [16] “Had it not been for Allaah&#8217;s checking of one set of people by means of another, these places (mentioned in the aayah) which were beloved to Allaah before Islaam (i.e. in its final and comprehensive form), would have been pulled down. After Islaam, these places are known to Allaah, but hated. Allaah, for example commanded special treatment to the People of the Book under the Islamic Rule, including their protection, yet He (Azza wa Jal) hates them. He commanded the defending of their places of worship, yet He hates them because other than He is being worshipped in such places&#8230;” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Atiyyah said: “He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) checked them when they were on the Truth before the alterations and abrogation [i.e. of their religions].” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Light of the Above, all the present nations of Jews, Christians, Sabians (if any are left), and those who worshipped Allaah based upon their fitrah,[19] must come to the Final Message from Allaah, and submit to Him alone in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The People of the Book as they exist now accepted other than Allaah as deities. No doubt that they are kufaar as Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) refers to them. When they according to ,عليهما السلام followed Mûsa and ‘Eessa the unaltered Torah and the original Gospel, respectively, they were Muslims then. Does a knowledgeable Muslim believe that those who think of ‘Eessa as Savior, a son of God, Three in One, etc. are believers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary!</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5:17)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are those who believe in Trinity believers in tawheed? Allaah says about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].” But there is no True God but One God [Allaah].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5:73)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remain as people of the Book since a Book was revealed to their respective Prophets. Whoever says he is a believer in their Books, even in their altered forms, is from the People of the Book. Any Christian or Jew, who dissociates himself from his respective Book and denies it, cannot be considered as being from the People of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Allaah, the All-Wise and All-Just, legislated certain guidelines that define certain relationships between the Muslims and the People of the Book. Amongst such relations, is marriage to the ‘afeefah (chaste) women of them,[20] eating their lawfully slaughtered meat, etc. Such distinctions do not make them true believers in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah commented on the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians] and al-Mushrikeen,[21] were not to leave [their disbelief] until there came to them clear evidence.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Bayyinah (98:1)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And say to those who were given the Scriptures [Jews and Christians] and to those who are illiterates [Arab pagans]: “Do you [also] submit yourselves [to Allaah in Islaam]?” If they do, they are rightly guided,</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:20)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “And other aayaat like those above address those who exist [i.e. from the Jews, Christians, and mushrikeen]. The Scripture that is referred to is the Book in their hands in which alterations and abrogation were carried out, and does not refer to those who held to the Scriptures before they were altered and abrogated, because they were not kufaar then. Also, they were not [the ones being addressed] by the Qur’aan as “you People of the Book,” because they died before the Qur’aan was revealed. So, all those who believe in the existing Books [altered and abrogated], are from the “People of the Book,” and they are kufaar because they hold to altered and abrogated Books, and they are, like all other kufaar, in Hell forever,[22] although Allaah, the Exalted, commanded that they pay jizyah [23] and made it permissible to eat their food and marry their women.” [24]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">In Conclusion:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The only deen accepted to Allaah is Islaam.<br />
2. Islaam is the last and final message to all mankind (Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, etc.)<br />
3. Islaam abrogated all religions.<br />
4. The Qur’aan is the true Word of Allaah and it abrogated all of the previously-revealed Scriptures.<br />
5. The Torah and al-Injeel as they exist in the hands of the “People of the Book” are altered. Even if their original forms are to be found at any time, then they are still abrogated by the Qur’aan.<br />
6. Had their Prophets been alive they would all follow and abide by the teachings of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). This is the Covenant which Allaah took upon all the Prophets. [25]<br />
7. Every believer should firmly believe that the Jews and Christians are kufaar and enemies of Allaah, His deen, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and the Believers.<br />
8. The kufaar who die on kufr will dwell forever in the Hell of Fire. However we don’t judge that a particular kaafir is in Hell except when their is a specification from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah.[26]<br />
9. The call for “Unity of Religions,” sometimes misleadingly called a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Comity of Religions</strong></span>,” aims at eliminating everything which distinguishes Islaam from kufr.<br />
10. Calling and supporting the concepts of the “Unity of Religion” is considered riddah (apostasy).[27]<br />
11. The above does not mean that the Muslim abandons calling the kufaar to Islaam.<br />
We are ordered to call them to the way of Allaah, and this is in the best of their interest and thus da’wah to Allaah is the best advice given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the great ways of da’wah is to deal with them justly and to call them to Allaah in the best way which is based upon good knowledge.[28] This does not mean that the Muslim compromise the basics of his deen. It also does not mean that Muslims should indulge with the kufaar in an aimless dialogue such as: “Tell us how you pray and we will tell you how we pray,” as done by some people who engage in such dialogue. The most important thing is: Who deserves to be worshipped alone? [29] They worship idols, images, men, etc. We worship the true God of all creation. So we call them with the right knowledge to abandon shirk and to submit to Allaah in tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best methodology (manhaj) of da’wah is that exemplified by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he sent Mu’aath ibn Jabal (radhi Allaahu anhu) to the “People of the Book” in Yemen. The first thing he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded him to do is to call them to tawheed and belief in Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as His Messenger.[30] Then he told him: “If they obey you to do so, then inform them that Allaah has enjoined upon them five salawaat [prayers] in every day and night [in twenty-four hours], and if they obey you and do so, then inform them that Allaah has made it obligatory for them to pay sadaqa [zakaat] from their properties and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to poor among them.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wrote about this matter several years ago when some Muslim brothers started to engage in “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>dialogue</strong></span>” with the People of the Book. I cautioned our brothers to establish that the “dialogue” should transform into a way for da’wah and not “negotiations” because we cannot negotiate on shirk. Now with the call for “Unity of Religion,” I urge all the Muslims to advise each other about the dangers of this concept and to direct their respective communities to disassociate from this Path of kufr. May Allaah Who is the Most High, above everything, guide the misguided and preserve and protect our ummah from all afflictions and innovations in deen. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Muslim disassociates himself from all forms of kufr and shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The believer distinguishes between the natural love he has for his father, mother, wife, husband, son, daughter, etc. from the unbelievers and enmity towards them because of their kufr. The natural love is something recognized by Islaam, otherwise Allaah would not have permitted marriage from chaste women of the People of the Book. This natural love of the kinsfolk and the just and good treatment of the thimmi,[32] non-harbi,[33] mu’aahad,[34] and the musta’min,[35] does not necessitate that we love them the love which obliges friendship and alliance. This kind of love is forbidden by Allaah because they oppose Allaah and His deen. The believer stands in a state of walaa’ (alliance and loyalty) and baraa’ (disassociation): alliance with the Believers who are obedient to Allaah and His Messenger, and enmity and disassociation from the unbelievers and those opposing Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">You will not find a people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, loving [by having friendship and alliance] with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم], even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kinsfolk. For such He has decreed true Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh [proofs, light and true guidance] from Himself. And We will admit them into the gardens of [al-jannah] beneath whose trees rivers flow and they will dwell therein forever. Allaah is pleased with them and they with him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the successful.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Mujaadalah (58:22)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This strengthening mentioned in the aayah applies to everyone who does not love the enemies of the Messengers, even though they may be one’s close relatives. This love is not the same as the natural (jibilli) love, but it is the love of nusrah which entails giving allegiance to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dealing justly with the non-combatant from the unbelievers is commanded by Allaah. Hence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The natural love is created by Allaah. He permitted it to occur.<br />
(b) The enmity towards the unbelievers because of their disbelief and rejection of Allaah is legislated by Allaah.<br />
(c) Dealing justly with the non-combatants from the unbelievers is commanded by Allaah. It is forbidden to harm them, especially if they are under the protection of a Muslims or in a Muslim land permitted by the Muslim ruler as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever killed a mu’aahad shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of fourty years (of traveling).</span></em> [Al-Bukhaari, v. 9, no. 49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this matter is not a “political” affair, rather it is from the Deen of Allaah. And the “evil of these actions, is that it causes the distortion of Islaam, since the enemies of Islam will capitalize on such occurrence in order to distort the reputation of Islam and to turn people away from it, although Islaam is innocent of such acts&#8230;” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why all believers in Allaah who love Islaam should disassociate themselves from these deviant paths even if they raise “attractive” banners, remembering that the early dissidents (al-Khawaarij) were foremost in worship of Allaah, yet they deviated from the true Path. Since the three matters are all from Allaah and since He (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope,</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:286)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the three matters outlined above are within the scope of the believer and they are just and not contradictory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Path of the prophets. Contemplate about Prophet Nooh (alaihis salam) and His son when the just decree of Allaah (the Deluge) [37] came upon the kufaar from the people of Nooh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And Nooh [Noah] called out to his son, who had separated himself [apart], ‘O my son! Embark with us and be not with the unbelievers.’</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:42)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His son chose the way of the unbelievers and thought that he will be saved from the water if he takes himself to a mountain. Nooh (alaihis salam) invoked Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Nooh [Noah] called upon his Rabb [Allaah] and said, ‘O my Rabb! Verily my son is of my family! And certainly, Your Promise is true, and You are the Most Just of judges.’</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:45)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily my son is of my family!” This is the natural relationship, the jibilli one. Allaah, Most High, reminded Nooh (alaihis salam) of His command of Legal disassociation (al-baraa’ ash-shar’i) from the kufaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O Nooh! Surely, he is not of your family [not from the believers of your family]; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.”</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:46)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The immediate submission of Nooh was clear in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Rabb! I seek refuge with You from asking You that which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:47)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a clear distinction between the jibilli and shar’i perspectives in the relationship between Nooh and his son. Contemplate also the relationship with parents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And We have enjoined on man [to be dutiful and good] to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years—give thanks to Me and to your parents—unto Me is the final destination. But if they [both] strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, yet deal with them justly and kindly in this life.</em></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Luqmaan (31:14 &amp; 15)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friendship and alliance and pleasing those who oppose Allaah are an indication of either lack of faith or its weakness in the heart of the believer. It is against reason that a person can have walaa’ for someone who is an enemy of the one he truly loves. You find those who have walaa’ for the unbelievers doing things which will earn the love and friendship of the unbelievers by any means. Those who know the truth regarding this matter must remind them of the command of Allaah that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe do not take as friends and protectors your fathers and your brothers if they choose unbelief to belief and whoever of you takes them as friends and protectors is one of the transgressors.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Sooart At-Tawbah (9:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Mighty and Majestic, set for us the example of Prophet Ibraaheem (alaihis salam) by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There has been for you an example for you to follow in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their unbelieving people: ‘We are free of you and whatever idols you worship besides Allaah, and we deny what you are upon and we reject you; and because of your disbelief in Allaah and your worship of others besides Him, enmity and hatred has arisen between us for ever, unless you believe truly in Allaah, and single Him out, and worship Him alone.’</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Mumtahinah (60:4)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The efforts to gain the friendship of the Jews and Christians are useless, as they will never be pleased with the Muslims until the Muslims follow their religion. Addressing Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), the Imaam of the Muslims, Allaah, the Exalted, warned him that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you [O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)] till you follow their religion.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:120)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the command to abstain from following the paths of the Jews and Christians applies to the entire Ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.</em> </span>[Qur’aan, Sooart Qaaf (50:37)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam of Allaah be upon Muhammad, his family, his companions, and those who follow on their path in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi wa Sallam): The salaah and sa-laam of Allaah be upon His Prophet Muhammad. The salaah of Allaah upon Prophet Muhammad is His Praise of the Prophet before the angels who are close to (but below) Allaah, the Most High, who istawaa (ascended) His ‘arsh (Throne), which is above the seven heavens, in a manner that suits His Majesty. The angels also praise the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The salaam is Allaah’s safeguarding of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from deficiencies and any kind of evil, and the protection of the Message with which he was entrusted. When the Muslim says صلى الله عليه و سلم (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), he invokes Allaah to grant His Praise and Security to Prophet Muhammad and the protection of the Message of Islaam which was revealed to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). [See Ibnul Qayyim’s Jalaa’ul Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati-wa-Salaam ‘alaa Muhammadin Khairil Anaam, [Damascus, Syria: Daar ibn Katheer, and Al-Madeenah, KSA: Daarut-Turaath, 1408/1988], p.128.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Rabb: Allaah is Ar-Rabb. He is the One Who gave all things the power to grow, to move and to change, to Whom belongs the Creation and Commandment; the Master Who has no equal in His Sovereignty, Predominance, and Highness, The One Who Provides for and Sustains all that exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Deen: The practical and doctrinal aspects of deen are more comprehensive than the Western concept of religion. The deen of Islaam is the way of life prescribed by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] So often one hear the following: “We are cousins of Jews and Christians. We worship the same God, follow the teachings of the same Prophets, and believe in the same books. We are all followers of Abraham.” This concept is in direct opposition to the teachings of the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. Those who associate partners with Allaah in worship and (or) worship Prophets are not believers in Allaah. The books of the Jews and Christians contain alterations and are completely abrogated by the Qur’aan. The Jews and Christians are not followers of the faith of tawheed of Ibraaheem (Abraham) for Ibraaheem was neither a Christian nor a Jew, he was a pure Muslim, as Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Haneefan (who worshipped none but Allaah Alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrikeen.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:67)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had they been true followers of their Prophets, the Jews and Christians would believe in the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his message of Islaam. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“By Him (Allaah) in Whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the Message with which I have been sent (i.e. tawheed), but he will be from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.”</span></em> [Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 284].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the attestation with full acceptance and submission, not just mere attestation, that what he brought forth is the truth. That is why Abu Taalib (the uncle of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not become a believer in the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), despite his attestation to what the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought forth and his witness that it is the best of religions.The brother who uttered the aforementioned statement should repent to correct it, and declare the truth in the best ,تعالى Allaah possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If only they had referred it to the Messenger or to ulil-amr [learned scholars and those charged with authority] among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them [directly].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:83)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was the norm for the sahaabah to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in his life of what they did not know. Then after his death they asked the learned amongst them, and so did those who followed their path in righteousness. Asking the learned scholars, therefore, was the way of the salaf especially if something doubtful arose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] A past nation who used to live in al-Mawsil (‘Iraq) and said, “La Ilaaha Illal-laah.” They were neither Jews nor Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Ibn Taymeeyah in Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh Liman Baddala Deenal-Maseeh (The Correct Response for those who Altered the Religion of ‘Eessa) [Riyaadh, KSA: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1414/1993] vol. 2, pp. 212-213. As to whether Jews and Christians of our times are from the People of the Book or not, one first should understand what the term “People of the Book” means. It means that original Books were revealed to their prophets, Mûsa and ‘Eessa, respectively. When they held to the beliefs of ‘Eessa and Mûsa, they were not kufaar. However, when they continued to believe in the altered and abrogated forms of these Books and commit shirk, they became kufaar, even though they are still referred to as “People of the Book.” Allaah knew they would alter the Books and warned them against that. He (Azza wa Jal) still refers to them in the Qur’aan as “People of The Book,” and clearly states that they have committed kufr and deviated from the path of tawheed which their prophets called them to adhere to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Like the belief of Muslims who accepted the Message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Includes those amongst them who had faith before Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was sent to mankind. The believers whom Allaah described:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him [‘Eessa] compassion and Mercy&#8230;So, We gave those among them who believed their [due] reward, but many of them are Fassiqoon [rebellious, disobedient to Allaah]. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hadeed (57:27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]The revelation includes the Qur’aan and the authentic sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Ibn Taymeeyah explained that some of the sahaabah (e.g. Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullaah, ibn ‘Abbaas, and Anas ibn Maalik as well as most of the scholars mentioned that رضي الله عنهم the aayah (Qur’aan 3:199), was revealed concerning the faith of an-Najaashi, the king of Abasseenyah known as “as-hamah” (‘Atiyyah, in Arabic), who knew that the Message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was the truth confirming that of ‘Eessa before him. He accepted Islaam but was unable to migrate to daarul-Islaam (where Islaam is the apparent and practiced deen), nor he was able to declare it amongst his Christian nation. After the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) knew of his death, he called upon the sahaabah and performed the funeral prayers in absentia on an-Najaashi, thus confirming his belief in Islaam. The aayah, therefore, may apply to anyone from the People of the Book or the mushrikeen who lives in daarul-harb (a land in which the kufaar are prevailing, or land of the kufaar between whom and the Muslims there is no peace) and who believes in Allaah and in Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as Allaah&#8217;s Final Messenger, yet unable to declare his faith openly or unable to migrate to any Muslim country. He does what he is able to do from the acts of worship and as he knows them. [See ibn Taymeeyah’s Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh], pp. 202-210.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Collected by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. The text is as reported by al-Bukhaari in his saheeh, vol. 4, no. 255, p.158. The (*) refers to some parts of the text as reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Those who claim to be followers of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) and the true Injeel (Gospel) should have a general love for Islaam and its people, because the teachings of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) were based upon mercy and kindness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and Mercy. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hadeed (57:27)]. In fact they must submit to Allaah and His deen because the in ,عليهما الصلاة والسلام messages of ‘Eessa and Muhammad calling the people to the tawheed, are the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] See Shaykh-ul-Islaam’s Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh, vol. 2, pp. 201-213.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] This is correction of the original statement “in shaa’ Allaah, believers,” and which came in the first print as well as in the first print of “The Message and the Messengers.” And Allaah’s forgiveness is sought in case of any error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] In Badaai’ At-Tafseer (The Unprecedented of Tafseer), which is a collection of explanations of certain aayaat of the Qur’aan, collected by Yusri as-Sayed Ahmad [Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar ibnul Jawzi, 1414/1993], vol. 3, p. 214.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Allaah willed them to exist, yet He hates the shirk practiced by them. He willed and created Iblees (the Devil) and He hates him. This is His Universal Will: al-iraadah al-kawniyyah. Allaah’s Judicial Will: al-iraadah ash-shar’iyyah is to protect their places of worship as long as they do not openly carry out their worship outside such places, and they conform to all of the rules regarding their interactions with Isamic Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Quoted in Fathul-Bayaan fee Maqassidil-Qur’aan (The Eloquent Clarification to the Objectives of the Qur’aan), by Sidique Hassan al-Khanouji al-Bukhaari [Sidon, Beirut, Lebanon: ad-Daar al-’Assriyyah, 1412/1992], vol. 9, p. 57.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Fitrah: natural inclination to worship Allaah alone. Every human is born on this state. That is why if someone reverts to Islam, then he/she returns to his initial state of submission to the only true God, Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Certainly it is advised to marry the Muslim woman even if a chaste woman of the people of the Book offers herself for marriage to a Muslim. There are so many problems associated with marriage to women from the People of the Book in our times. The Muslim must be very careful about such a decision if it deems necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]Mushrikeen: Those who commit shirk including pagans, polytheists, idolaters, and unbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah and in His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] If they die on their beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Head-tax imposed by Islaam on the People of the Book and other people who have a revealed book when they live under Muslim rule, wherein they and their properties and wealth are protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Quoted in Majmoo’ Al-Fataawaa, vol. 35, pp. 227-228.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] Allaah says (what means): And [remember] when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah [understanding of the Laws of Allaah], and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree [to it] and will you make up My Covenant [which I conclude with you]?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses [for this].’ [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:81)]. Furthermore, in the hadeeth reported by Imaam Ahmad and others, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said (what means), “If Mûsa were alive and present among you, it would not be permissible for him to do anything but to follow me.” [Ash-Shaykh Al-Albaani stated that it is reported by Ahmad, Al-Bayhaqi, and Ad-Daarimee, Al-Laalkaa’ee, Al-Harawee and others, and that its degree of authenticity is hasan. See Mishkaatul-Masaabeeh, vol. 1, no. 177].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] Example Abu Taalib is in Hell, and Fir’awn is in Hell, as well as others specified in authentic texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] This ruling has been published as a religious verdict (fatwa) by the Permanent Committee for Islamic and Educational Research in Saudi Arabia on the 25th of Muharram, 1418 (corresponding to 31-5-1997), no. 19402.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] The aayah in Soorat Al-’Ankaboot (29:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(which means), <em><span style="color:#008000;">“And do not argue with the People of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians), unless it be in [a way] that is better, except with such of them as do wrong, and say [to them]: “We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you; our Ilaah [God] and your Ilaah [God] is One [i.e. Allaah], and it is to Him we submit [in Islaam],”</span></em> calls the believers to argue with the People of the Book in a way that is better, i.e.inviting them to Allaah with His aayaat (verses, proofs, evidences, etc.) using the clearest indicative words which proves the objective and to avoid being harsh save with such of them as do wrong. [See Tafseer ibn Jareer At-Tabaree for this aayah as well ibnul Qayyim’s Madaarijus-Saalikeen (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul-Fikr, checked by Muhammad Haamid Al-Fiqee, n.d.], vol. 1, pp. 445-446. It is not a call for interfaith dialogue. It is a call for a common word between them and us. This word has been defined by Allaah, Most High, in the following Aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[which means]: <em><span style="color:#008000;">O People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians]: Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslims.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-‘Imraan (3:64)]. Certainly it is not a call for “comity” or “unity of religions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] In the year 1415 (1995), I wrote a book as well as a short article entitled, “<strong>Who Deserves to be Worshipped Alone?</strong>” In shaa’ Allaah (Allaah Willing) it is helpful to address people from all religions. The article is available on the site: understand-islam.net.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30] Not just the so-called “recognition” given by some theologians from the People of the Book in our times!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31]The text is in Saheeh Al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 2, no. 478. It is also reported by Muslim.<br />
[32] Thimmi: A non-Muslim living in a Muslim country and upon whom the jizyah applies. Those non-Muslims are under the protection of the Muslims.<br />
[33] The non-combatants from the unbelievers.<br />
[34] An unbeliever between whom and the Muslims a term of peace has been made for a definite time.<br />
[35] The unbeliever who is permitted into the Muslim land by the approval of the Muslim governor, e.g. visiting, business, etc.<br />
[36] From the fatwa of or Shayekh, Muhammad bin Salih al-‘Uthaimeen (may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him), concerning the bombings that took place in al-Khubar (Saudi Araia) in the year 1419. See al-Fataawaa ash-Shar’iyyah fil Qadaayaa al-Mua’aasirah (Legal Verdicts Regarding Current Issues), pp. 80-87, collected by Muhammad bin Fahd al-Husayyin, with an introductory by Shayekh Salih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him). Shayekh bin ‘Uthaimeen enumerated many other evil consequences of such actions, including spreading ciaos in the land, destruction of humans and their wealths, and more.<br />
[37] The great flood in the time of Nooh (alaihis salam).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: We have read a verdict from you published in “al-Da’wah” magazine that one should not pray for the overall destruction of Jews and Christians. Hearing this, we were confused by the seemingly contrasting supplication of prophet Nūh (alaihissalam). We hope you will explain this verdict of yours with the evidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As sallamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago (13<sup>th</sup> Ramadaan), in the masjid of the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi  wa sallam</i>) in Medina, in his explanation of Usool-us-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad, Sheikh Saaleh bin Sa’d as-Suhaymee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“My brothers, do not forget your brothers in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and in every place in your supplications because of these well-known conspiracies which have been agreed upon by all from amongst the disbelievers from the Jews and the Christians, the hizb-ul-Iblees (the party of Iblees), the Raafidah and other than them. They are agreed upon in concocting these conspiracies to divert the Muslims away from Tawheed and to put them to trial and so that they can reach their goals of completely eradicating the Muslims of Ahlus-Sunnah. </b><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <b>However, they will bring in loss (upon themselves) – by the permission of Allah – whether it is the Jews and the Christians of the west and the east, or the party of Iblees, or the Raafidah or those who conspire with them against Ahlus-Sunnah, or the Khawaarij or other than them. All of these (groups) will come to an end – by the permission of Allah. Every time a tentacle from amongst them appears, it will be cut off, and Allah will cut off their tentacles – by the permission of Allah, The Most High&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then stressed the importance of the Muslims returning back to Allah and to have reliance upon Him alone. He mentioned how the day before someone in Gaza had even called upon Salaah-ud-Deen al-Ayubee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) to help them and that this is the very essence of Shirk. The Sheikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“How do you expect to be rescued (from these trials) whilst you are calling upon other than Allah?”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then advised the Muslims to call upon Allah alone and not upon anyone else, including the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi wa sallam</i>). He then supplicated for the destruction of all these groups, whether it is the ‘devils’ of the Khawaarij and The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, or the ‘devils’ of the Jews and the Christians in the east and the west or the ‘devils’ of the Raafidah or the hizb of Iblees. He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“&#8230;By Allah, the Jews and the Christians and the west and the east are not the enemies of the Raafidah. They are not the enemies of the Khawaarij. They are the ones who brought them in, they are the ones who armed them and they are the ones who sold weapons to them. This is because the goal which they have in mind is to completely eradicate Ahlus-Sunnah, the Salafees, Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jammah. However, they will bring in loss, failure and disappointment (upon themselves) by the permission of Allah, The Most Merciful&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transcription of the Sheikh’s words can be found at:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah save the Muslims from the conspiracies of the Jews and Christians, the Raafidah and the Khawaarij. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Some people understood from your answer to the first question in the interview about concluding treaties with the Jews that signing a peace treaty or truce with the Jews who captured the lands and committed transgressions is unconditionally permissible. They also understood that they have to support and befriend the Jews. Making peace with them requires the Muslims not to stir hatred and disavowal of the Jews in the educational curriculum or mass media in the Muslim countries. The world is now witnessing a phase of international reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. It is not allowed to arouse feelings of religious hatred among people. Would you please explain this issue.</span></p>
<p>A 1: <strong>Making peace with the Jews or other disbelievers does not necessitate support and friendship</strong>. It ensures that both sides enjoy safety and peace and may engage in other dealings such as sale, purchase, and exchange of ambassadors. These actions do not require the Muslims to support or befriend the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) concluded <strong>peace treaties with the people of Makkah</strong>. This act did not force the Muslims to befriend or support the pagans, but the feelings of hatred remain until the Opening of Makkah and people entered into the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) in multitudes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, he (peace be upon him) <strong>made peace with the Jews of Al-Madinah</strong> for an unlimited period when he emigrated to Al-Madinah. He (peace be upon him) used to buy things from them, talk to them and call them to Islam but it was not necessary to befriend or support them. Furthermore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) died while his armor was in pawn with a Jew in return for food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Banu Al-Nadir, a Jewish tribe, committed high treason, they were expelled from Al-Madinah. When Qurayzhah breached the covenant and joined a besieging army of the enemy that came from Makkah to fight the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the Day of Ahzab, the Prophet (peace be upon him) fought them killing their leaders and taking their women and offspring captives. When Sa`d Ibn Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) judged them, he judged that the men must be killed and the women and children taken captives. So, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he judged according to the judgment of Allah (Exalted be He) from above the seven heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims among the Sahabh and their followers often declared a <strong>truce with the Christians and other non-Muslims</strong> without having to support or befriend them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are Al-Mushrikûn</span>. <span style="color:#525253;"> [Sooratul-Maa‘idah 5:82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221; <span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Mumtahinah 60:4]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says, <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Maa‘idah 5:51]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people)</span>.<span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Mujaadilah 58:22]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs that convey the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is another situation showing that making peace with the Jews or other disbelievers, when necessary, does not necessitate supporting and befriending them. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) conquered <strong>Khaybar</strong>, <strong>he made peace with the Jews</strong> and agreed that they take care of the palms and fields and the harvest was to be halved between them and the Muslims. This agreement was unlimited and they stayed in Khaybar under this agreement as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, We will let you stay on this (condition), as long as we will.<strong>[1]</strong> According to another narration, “We will let you stay, as long as Allah will let you stay.” <strong>[2]</strong> They stayed there until `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) evacuated them. It is narrated that when `Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with him) estimated the value due on the fruits of the palm trees one year, they alleged that the value was unjust. He (may Allah be pleased with them) told them, &#8220;By Allah! My hatred for you and my love for the Muslims will never make me treat you unjustly. If you will, accept my bulk assessment of the outcome that I made for you; otherwise we accept it all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, these situations indicate that making peace treaties and truce with the enemies of Allah does not require us to support or befriend them, as some of those who are not aware of the rulings of the purified Shari`ah believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It should be clear that making peace treaties with the Jews or other disbelievers does not require us to change the educational curriculum or other dealings based on support and befriending</strong>. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Two Episodes of Jewish Mischief [From Tafsir Soorah al-`Isra]<br />
Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Volume 5<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 17. Al-Isra&#8217; (4-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed you would do mischief in the land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. So, when the promise came for the first of the two, We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was a promise (completely) fulfilled. 6. <i>Then We gave you a return of victory over them. And We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>7. (And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221; Then, when the second promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces and to enter the Masjid as they had entered it before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell in their hands.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>8. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you, but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment). And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.</i></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned in the Tawrah that the Jews would spread Mischief twice</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He made a declaration to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, meaning that He had already told them in the Book which He revealed to them, that they would cause mischief on the earth twice, and would become tyrants and extremely arrogant, meaning they would become shameless oppressors of people, Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We made known this decree to him, that the root of those (sinners) was to be cut off in the early morning. </strong>(15:66),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, We already told him about that and informed him of it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The First Episode of Mischief caused by the Jews, and their Punishment for it</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, when the promise came for the first of the two</strong>, meaning the first of the two episodes of mischief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means, &#8216;We unleashed soldiers against you from among Our creatures who were given to terrible warfare,&#8217; i.e., they had great strength and weapons and power. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes, meaning they took possession of your land and invaded the very innermost parts of your homes, going between and through your houses, coming and going freely with no fear of anyone. This was the promise (completely) fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The earlier and later commentators differed over the identity of these invaders. Many <i>Isra`iliyyat</i> (reports from Jewish sources) were narrated about this, but I did not want to make this book too long by mentioning them, because some of them are fabricated, concocted by their heretics, and others may be true, but we have no need of them, praise be to Allah. What Allah has told us in His Book (the Qur&#8217;an) is sufficient and we have no need of what is in the other books that came before. Neither Allah nor His Messenger required us to refer to them. Allah told His Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that when (the Jews) committed transgression and aggression, Allah gave their enemies power over them to destroy their country and enter the innermost parts of their homes. Their humiliation and subjugation was a befitting punishment, and your Lord is never unfair or unjust to His servants. They had rebelled and killed many of the Prophets and scholars. Ibn Jarir recorded that Yahya bin Satd said: &#8220;I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Al-Musayyib saying: &#8216;Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ash-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine), destroying Jerusalem and killing them, then he came to Damascus and found blood boiling in a censer. He asked them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this blood? They said: We found our forefathers doing this. Because of that blood, he killed seventy thousand of the believers and others, then the blood stoppedboiling.&#8221;[At-Tabari 17:369.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is <i>Sahih</i> from Said bin Al-Musayyib, and this event is well-known, as he (Nebuchadnezzar) killed their nobles and scholars, and did not leave alive anyone who knew the Tawrah by heart. He took many prisoners from the sons of the Prophets and others, and did many other things that would take too long to mention here. If we had found anything that was correct or close enough, we could have written it and reported it here. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says elsewhere:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself. </strong>[45:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Episode of Mischief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then, when the second promise came to pass</strong>, meaning, the second episode of mischief, when your enemies came again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces</strong>, meaning, to humiliate you and subdue you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and to enter the Masjid</strong>, meaning, Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as they had entered it before</strong>, when they entered the very innermost parts of your homes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and to destroy wrecking and inflicting ruin upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>all that fell in their hands</strong>, everything they could get their hands on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with utter destruction. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you</strong> , meaning that He may rid you of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment)</strong>,  meaning, if you return to causing mischief,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We shall return </strong>means We will once again punish you in this world, along with the punishment and torment We save for you in the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We have made Hell a prison [Hasir] for the disbelievers</strong>, meaning, a place of permanent detention, a prison which cannot be avoided or escaped. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;<i>Hasiir </i>here means a jail.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be detained in it.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Others said likewise. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;<i>Hasir </i>means a bed of Fire.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Qatadah said: &#8220;The Children of Israel returned to aggression, so Allah sent this group against them, Muhammad sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam and his companions, who made them pay the <i>Jizyah</i>, [a tax levied from People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who are under the protection of a Muslim government] with willing submission, and feeling themselves subdued.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:389]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(64. The Jews say: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221; Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends as He wills. Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa, We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(66. And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur&#8217;an), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Jews say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221;) &#8220;They do not mean that Allah&#8217;s Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.) In this Ayah, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. Allah describes stinginess by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck. ) Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah&#8217;s curses be on them. `Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. We mentioned before that Finhas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!&#8221;) and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered.) What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Or have they a share in the dominion Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.) and, n</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indignity is put over them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Hands are Widely Outstretched</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills.) Allah&#8217;s favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate.) There are many other Ayat on this subject. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that `Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, &#8220;This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah&#8217;s Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers.) He also said, قُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Spend and I will spend on you.&#8217;)&#8221; This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged)<br />
Ale Imraan Verses 3.65 and 3.67 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. O people of the Scripture! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim, while the Tawrah and the Injil were not revealed till after him Have you then no sense) (66. Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.) (67. Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa and he was not of the Mushrikin ) (68. Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.&#8217; The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.&#8217; So Allah sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time&#8221; This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you then no sense)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa), shunning Shirk and living in Iman,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and he was not of the Mushrikin.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah is similar to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided&#8230;&#8221;) 2:135</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means, &#8220;The people who have the most right to be followers of Ibrahim are those who followed his religion and this Prophet, Muhammad , and his Companions from the Muhajirin, Ansar and those who followed their lead.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every Prophet had a Wali (supporter, best friend) from among the Prophets. My Wali among them is my father Ibrahim, the Khalil (intimate friend) of my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.) means, Allah is the Protector of all those who believe in His Messengers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then refutes the Christians&#8217; and Jews&#8217; false claims and lies,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the Jews and the Christians say, &#8220;We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.&#8221;) They claim: &#8220;We are the followers of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, who are His children, whom He takes care of. He also loves us.&#8221; The People of the Book claim in their Book that Allah said to His servant Isra&#8217;il, &#8220;You are my firstborn.&#8221; But they explained this statement in an improper manner and altered its meaning. Some of the People of the Book who later became Muslims refuted this false statement saying, &#8220;This statement only indicates honor and respect, as is common in their speech at that time.&#8221; The Christians claim that `Isa said to them, &#8220;I will go back to my father and your father,&#8221; meaning, my Lord and your Lord. It is a fact that the Christians did not claim that they too are Allah&#8217;s sons as they claimed about `Isa. Rather this statement by `Isa only meant to indicate a closeness with Allah. This is why when they said that they are Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, Allah refuted their claim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Why then does He punish you for your sins&#8221;) meaning, if you were truly as you claim, Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, then why did He prepare the Fire because of your disbelief, lies and false claims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, you are but human beings, of those He has created,) Allah states: you are just like the rest of the children of Adam, and Allah is the Lord of all His creation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.) Allah does what He wills, there is none who can escape His judgement, and He is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them;) Therefore, everything is Allah&#8217;s property and under His power and control,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and to Him is the return.) In the end, the return will be to Allah and He will judge between His servants as He will, and He is the Most Just Who is never wrong in His judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>Question</strong>: One of the preachers in one of the mosques in Europe claimed that it is not allowed to consider Jews and Christians disbelievers. You know &#8211; may Allaah preserve you &#8211; that most of the people who attend the mosques in Europe have very little knowledge. We fear that statements like this one will become widespread. Therefore, we request from you a complete and clear answer to this question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say: The statement that came from that man is misguidance. In fact, it can be blasphemy. This is because Allaah has declared that Jews and Christians are disbelievers (kuffaar) in His Book. Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allaah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allaah.’ This is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allaah’s curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth. They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allaah and [they also took as Lord] the Messiah, son of Mary. But they were commanded only to worship none but One God. Praise and Glory be to Him, [far above is He] from having the partners they associate with Him.&#8221;</span> [at-Taubah 9:30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That shows that they are polytheists who associate partners with Allaah. In other verses, Allaah has made it clear that they are disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:17 and 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely, disbelievers are those who said, ‘Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book and the idolaters will abide in the Fire of Hell.&#8221;</span> [al-Bayyinah 98:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many verses and hadith express the same meaning. The one who rejects the idea that the Jews and the Christians who do not believe in Muhammad [peace be upon him] and deny him are disbelievers is, in fact, denying what Allaah has said. Denying what Allaah has said is blasphemy. <strong>If anyone has any doubt concerning them being disbelievers, then he himself is also a disbeliever.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Glory be to Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could that man be pleased to say that it is not allowed to say that they are disbelievers when they themselves say that Allaah is one of a Trinity? Their Creator Himself has declared that they are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers when they actually say, &#8220;Jesus is the son of God&#8221; or &#8220;the hand of Allaah is tied,&#8221; and &#8220;Allaah is poor and we are rich&#8221;?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers and apply the word of disbelief (kufr) to them in general when they describe their Lord in such ways that are nothing but cursing and abusing Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call upon that man to repent to Allaah and to read Allaah’s words, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so that they (too) would compromise with you.&#8221;</span> [al-Qalam (68):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should make it clear to everyone that they are disbelievers and that they are the inhabitants of the Hell-fire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;By the One in whose hand my soul is, no Jew or Christian of this community hears about me &#8211; that is from the community of people from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) until the Day of Judgment &#8211; and then does not follow me &#8211; or he said does not believe in what I brought &#8211; except that he is from the inhabitants of the Hell-fire.&#8221;</span> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who made such a statement must repent to his Lord because of this great falsehood he has stated. He must make a clear announcement that they are disbelievers and that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire. He must also announce that it is obligatory upon them to follow the unlettered Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). he is the one that the Jews and the Christians know and they know him like they know their own sons. Allaah has stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:157]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the one of whom Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him) gave glad tidings. Jesus said, as His Lord states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Israel, I am the Messenger of Allaah for you confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad [one of the names of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him]. But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is clear magic.’&#8221;</span> [as-Saff 61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the one, Ahmad, who was promised came to them with clear signs, they said that it was nothing but magic. By this, we can refute those Christians who say that the one Jesus promised was named Ahmad and not Muhammad. We say to that that Allaah said, &#8220;When he came with clear proofs,&#8221; and none has come to you after Jesus except Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muhammad is Ahmad and Allaah inspired Jesus to call Muhammad Ahmad. This is because Ahmad is a name from the root meaning, &#8220;to praise,&#8221; and the name itself means, &#8220;One who praises Allaah more than others.&#8221; Therefore, [Muhammad (peace be upon him)] is the most praiseworthy of Allaah among all peoples&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further say: If anyone claims that there is a religion on earth other than Islam that is acceptable to Allaah, then the person who made that claim is a disbeliever and there is no doubt about his disbelief. This is because Allaah has said in His Book, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:85]. Allaah has also said, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Truly, the religion in the sight of Allaah is Islam&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:19]. Another verse states, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8221;</span> [al-Maida 5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on that &#8211; and I repeat it for a third time &#8211; the person who made that statement [mentioned in the question] must repent to Allaah, Most High. And he must also make it clear to all the people that those Jews and Christians are disbelievers. This is so because the proof has been established against them, they have received the message but they have refused to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews have been described as those who have earned Allaah’s wrath. That is because they knew the truth and chose to go against it. The Christians have been described as those who have gone astray. This is because they sought the truth but were misled from it. Now, all of them have knowledge of the truth and recognize it. However, they go against it. Therefore, they all deserve to have the wrath of Allaah upon them. I call all those Jews and Christians to believe in Allaah and all of His Messengers. I call upon them to follow the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This is what they have been ordered to do in their own books. Allaah states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Mercy embraces all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are God-fearing and give zakat, and those who believe in Our revelations. Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful. Say (O Muhammad): O Mankind! Verily, I am sent to all of you as the Messenger of Allaah, to whom belongs the heavens and the earth. There is no true God but He. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered, who believes in Allaah and His Words. And follow him so that you may be guided.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:156-158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[By having such faith, those converts from Judaism and Christianity] shall receive their reward twice. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are three people who will receive their rewards twice: A person from the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] who believed in his prophet and believed in Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have also found in the law book al-Iqna`, in the section on apostasy, where the author has stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;One who does not consider as a disbeliever one who follows a religion other than Islam, such as the Christians, or who has doubt about their disbelief or who approves of their way himself is a disbeliever.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he quotes Ibn Taimiya as saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;[The following is] a disbeliever: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever believes that churches are the houses of Allaah in which he He is worshipped or who thinks that what the Jews and Christians do are valid acts of worship of Allaah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, or loves or approves of what they do, or aids them in having such places and establishing their religion, and he does so thinking that is a way of getting closer to Allaah or worshipping Allaah.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He also stated, </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If someone believes that visiting the Jews and the Christians in their places of worship is an act that brings him closer to Allaah, then he is an apostate.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statements support what was stated in the text of the answer. This is a matter concerning which there is no room for doubt. And help is sought only with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This question was responded by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Fatawa Islamiya, vol. 1, p. 87, Darussalam publishers</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21079</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: On 12/8/1420 A.H. notices were placed on the roads of Riyadh conveying congratulations from the Banque Saudi Fransi on the <span id="ContentParagraph" style="font-family:tahoma;">New Year</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Employees of the Banque Saudi Fransi wish the Saudi people a merry year. Respected shaykh, it undoubtedly hurts every Muslim to find things like this common in the land of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques, the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I hope that Your Honor will clarify the ruling of Islam on this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Muslim is prohibited to congratulate the disbelievers, Christians, Jews or whomever, on their distinctive occasions. This involves a sort of agreeing with them on their falsehood and being loyal to them. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Similarly, a Muslim is prohibited to congratulate his Muslim brother on the feasts and celebrations of the disbelievers. By doing so, a Muslim imitates them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims must resent disbelievers, dissociate themselves from them and hate their disbelief and disobedience to Allah, as Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><strong>Anyone who imitates a people becomes one of them</strong>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah </span>commented on this Hadith saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>This Hadith at least implies that it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers though it apparently signifies the disbelief of the imitator</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow' id=" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <span style="color:#ff0000;">Muslims are not permitted to express joy or congratulate disbelievers on their festive occasions, whether by word of mouth, posters, newspapers, magazines, cards or the like</span>. The legal authorities must remove these notices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success . May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sahih Bukhari , Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</span></p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <em>Surat-al-Baqara</em> and <em>Al-Imran,</em> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>
