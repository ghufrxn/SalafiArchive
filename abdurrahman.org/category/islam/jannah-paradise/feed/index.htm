<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 69</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise and they return to shelter to lamps beneath the Throne. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are in the well of <em>Barahoot</em> and are in <em>Sijjeen</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F380574881&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-souls-of-the-martyrs-are-within-the-bellies-of-green-birds-in-paradise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise,” </strong></span>for the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (soul) by means of which a person lives and moves and grasps things by his senses, it is a secret matter from the secrets of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. No-one knows it except Allaah, meaning no-one knows its true reality except Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ ۖ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they ask you about <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em> (the soul). Say, the soul is from the private affairs of my Lord and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>:</strong> Upon the basis that what is meant by the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> here is that by which a person lives; a person and an animal and the rest of the things possessing souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>: </strong>It is otherwise said that what is meant by <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em>; a type of the angels and Allaah knows best.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> in the Arabic language is a term, which is used to refer to that by means of which the possessors of souls will live because <strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaat</em> (life)</strong> is of two categories:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-<u>H</u>arakah:</em></strong> (Moving Life) &#8211; a life which involves movement; animate life and this occurs with those things possessing souls.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-Numoo: </em></strong>(Developing Life)<strong><em> &#8211; </em></strong>life that merely involves something growing and growing, this is what occurs in trees and plants.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them (types of life) is the life of the embryo in the womb of its mother before the soul is breathed into it. But when the soul is breathed into it then it becomes animate life, the life of movement. As for before that then it is just the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (spirit), which is the life of growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the rhetorical theologians and the philosophers are in confusion about the true reality of the soul and they are unable to comprehend it and they stumble and make many mistakes and were unable to comprehend it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> We find the like of that in:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The day when the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> and the angels will stand in rows.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa· (78), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to different types of life, you can refer to <em>Zaad ul-Ma`aad</em> of Imaam ibn ul-Qayyim volume 5 page 755.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said on this point<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“You should know that the souls of the martyrs are in the bellies of green birds that roam around freely in Paradise and they return to lamps beneath the Throne,” </strong></span>this occurs within a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (1,887) and it is the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying though that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are within the well of <em>Barahoot</em> and they are in <em>Sijjeen.</em>”</strong></span> Then I say, as for the well of <em>Barahoot</em> then it is a well to the East of `<em>Adan</em>; Aden of this place in Southern Yemen, between it and between <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt.</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are gathered within it,”</strong></span> there is no authentic proof for this. However, it occurs in a narration whose chain of narration contains a <em>majhool</em> (a person who’s unknown); being reported from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> as was mentioned by the one in the footnotes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad said, “I say what is correct is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, informed of:</p>
<p><strong>كَلَّا إِنَّ كِتَابَ الْفُجَّارِ لَفِي سِجِّينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The book of the wicked, they (the wicked), their souls will be in <em>Sijjeen</em>.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>As-Sijjeen</em> is an intensive form from <em>As-Sijn</em> (restriction) and it is a tight or restricted place and it (<em>Sijjeen</em>) is in the lowest depth of the earth as was said by the People of Knowledge. We ask Allah for safety and security from it, Aameen. And we seek Allaah’s refuge from His anger and from His painful punishment and Allaah grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise, the souls of the believers in general, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that the soul of the believer will be a bird, which will come and go in Paradise. The souls of the martyrs, it occurs that they will be in the belly of green birds, which come and go in Paradise and the souls of the believers in general, it is established also in the <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> that they will be birds that come and go in Paradise and this is from the proofs from the bliss of the grave for the soul enjoys bliss just as the body enjoys bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the matter of the souls of the disbelievers that they will be in the well of <em>Barahoot</em>, this is not authentic and it is a well in <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt</em>. And it occurs in some reports, which are brought by the scholars of <em>Tafseer</em> and perhaps they are reports from the <em>Banu Israa`eel</em> (People of the Book), which we do not affirm and we do not deny but however, nothing is established on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The soul of the believer will be a bird, which will eat from the trees of Paradise until Allaah resurrects it returning it to its body on the day when He resurrects it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> al-Jaami` as-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> no. 995 being reported by Imaam Maalik in his <em>Muwa<u>tt</u>a</em>, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, An-Nasaa`ee, Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ka`b ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 41 : Point 65</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah. And that Allaah will not punish anyone except according to the degree of his sins. And if He were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth; the righteous and the wicked amongst them, then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them. And it is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust since the unjust is the one who takes something that is not his to take, whereas creation and decree is for Allaah. The creation is His creation and the world is His world. He is not to be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned. And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah,” </strong><em>Al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) is expensive and exalted and it cannot be reached through deeds, no matter how much a person works and even if he does all the acts of obedience then his deeds will not meet up to the favours that have been bestowed upon him. So, if he were to be brought to account for those favours then no deed would remain for him. This is from one aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second aspect</strong> is that Paradise is expensive and it does not have a price that can be assessed in terms of deeds or wealth or other than that, no-one knows how tremendous it is except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, Allaah enters the believers into Paradise by His <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) by means of their deeds. So, deeds are just a <em>sabab</em> (means) towards entry into Paradise but they do not necessitate entry into Paradise nor are they the price for Paradise. And therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one from amongst you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in order that a person should not become amazed and complacent at his own deeds. It is not stated so that he should abandon performing deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong> ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Enter into Paradise on account of that which you used to do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah</em> 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Baa here does not show compensation or the price. Rather, the Baa here, <strong>“Bimaa Kuntum Ta’maloon”</strong> is to show a cause or a means, meaning by means of that which he used to do as is shown by the <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“None of you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.” So, they said, “Not even you Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So, he said, “Nor even me unless Allaah covers me with His mercy.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a person should not become amazed at his own deeds. However, a person will not enter into Paradise except by means of deeds. So, if a person did not perform any deeds, he will not enter Paradise because he has not carried out the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah does not punish anyone except in accordance with the degree of his sins,” </strong>Paradise is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (a favour) from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and is through the mercy of Allaah and deeds are a means for entry into it and the People of the Fire will not be punished except in accordance with their sins. They will not be punished because of the sins of other people and they will not be punished whilst not having any sins. So, this is from `<em>adl</em> (justice). So, Paradise is from <em>al-fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and the Fire is from <em>al-`adl</em> (justice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if He were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, the righteous ones of them and the wicked ones of them then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them.” </strong>This is just as has preceded that a person no matter how many deeds he performs then his deeds will not match up to even a part of the favours of Allaah upon him. If Allaah were to punish him that would be justice because of his falling short in giving thanks for the favours of Allaah upon him. And this speech which he mentioned is the text of a <u>h</u>adeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the people of His earth then He would punish them and He would not be unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better than their deeds deserved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because He would punish the evildoer on account of his evil acts and He would be punishing the righteous person because of the fact that his deeds did not qualify him for entry into Paradise because he did not match the favours of Allaah upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust,” </strong>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has declared Himself free of <em><u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression, injustice).</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Fu<u>ss</u>illat (41), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p><strong>لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There will be no injustice on this day. Allaah is quick in reckoning.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah</em> 17)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not wrong anyone.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We did not oppress them. However, they were the wrongdoers.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not oppress them but rather they oppressed their own souls.</span> </strong>(Soorah Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>118)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> reported the words of his Lord, He the Most High that He said: (Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O My servants I have made oppression forbidden for Myself and I have made it forbidden for you to oppress one another so do not commit oppression.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is a just judge and oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm</em>) does not befit Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And oppression is only one taking that which is not His to take whereas creation and decree is for Allaah.” </strong><em>A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression) is to wrongfully take the right of the people. And do the people have any right over Allaah? They have no right upon Allaah and no-one can make anything binding upon Allaah. Rather, the right of the servants with Allaah is that He should not punish one who does not associate anything with Him. <span style="color:#800080;">This is a right which He, the Perfect, has given as a favour</span>. And oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> is to put something in other than its due place. So, Allaah does not put punishment upon those who deserve bliss and He does not give bliss to those who deserve punishment. Rather, He gives bliss to those who deserve it and He gives punishment to those who deserve it and this is <em>al-`adl</em> (justice) but as for the opposite then that would be oppression. If He were to punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour to the people of disbelief, this would be oppression and Allaah is free of that. It is not possible that He will punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour upon the people of disbelief and that He will enter the disbelievers into Paradise and enter the believers into the Fire. This does not befit Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah; creation and decree are for Him and the creation is His creation and the world is His world.” </strong>Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not creating and commanding His? Exalted is Allaah, the Lord and nurturer of the whole of creation.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Alaa lahul- khalq,” </strong>Is creating not His?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is to bring things into existence from non-existence. So, all the created being were created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one can create along with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who they claim create with the like of His creation such that the creation is confused for them? Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer. </span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation such that the creation would be confused for them?”</strong> Such that that created by the servant resembles that created by Allaah, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, “Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer.”’</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see that which you call upon besides Allaah? Show me what they have created upon the earth.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<em>al-khalq</em>,” creating is for Allaah alone, <em>w`al-amar,</em>” and the decree and the command is for Him,” </strong><em>al-amar</em> (command/decree) is legislating and sending down legislation. So, the Creator, He is the one who commands and forbids and legislates for His servants whatever is beneficial for them and He it is Who forbids whatever is harmful for them and it is not for anyone to command or forbid or to obligate an act of worship or to prohibit anything without a proof.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they have partners who legislate things from the religion for them that Allaah has not given permission for.</span> </strong>(Soorah ash-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>amar</em> (decree/command) is for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, the command relating to what occurs in creation and relating to what is pre-decreed, <em>w’al amrush-shar`ee</em> (and the command relating to what is legislated), He commands and He prohibits, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not the creating and the command for Him?</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made a distinction between <em>khalq</em> (creating) and <em>al-amar</em> (commanding). So, this shows the command is not something created and this contains a refutation of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who said that the Qur·aan is created and that the speech of Allaah is created. So, Allaah had made a distinction between the creating and between the command. The command is from His speech and His legislation and Allaah has made a distinction between the creation and between the command. So, this proves that the speech of Allaah is not created.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the world is His world, He, the Majestic and Most High.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the abodes are three;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>daarud-duniya</em> (the abode of this world),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second,</strong> <em>wa daarul-barzakh</em> (intermediate period in the grave),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the third one,</strong> <em>wa daarul-qaraar wahiyaa al-aakhirah</em> (the abode of permanent residence and it is the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of them belong to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will not be asked about what He does but they will be asked,” </strong>He cannot be asked about what He does, He, the Perfect and Most High because His actions contain no deficiency and there is no shortcoming in them. So, they are perfect and precise and they never suffer from any deficiency or any shortcoming and questions are only to be asked about one who has deficiencies or shortcomings in his actions. So, Allaah cannot be asked about what He does because His actions are perfect and complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second reason;</strong> it is not just on account of His overpowering and His Lordship as is said by those who say it that He cannot be asked because of His tremendousness, He, the Perfect and Most High and because of His Majesty. However, it is not this alone, rather, He is not to be asked also because His actions are perfect and precise. They do not suffer from any deficiency at all or any flaws, contrary to the created being for he will be asked about his actions because he commits errors and his deeds are deficient and observations are to be made concerning him. So, he will be questioned because he is deficient from every aspect except for those who are rendered complete and aided and supported by Allaah. And therefore, he said, <strong>“But rather they will be questioned.”</strong> This is the difference between the Creator and the created being that Allah is not to be questioned whereas, the created being will be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“</strong><strong>And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation.</strong><strong>” </strong>No objection is to be raised about Allaah such that it is said, “Why did Allaah create such and such and How did Allaah create these things?” This is not permissible with respect to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Rather, it is upon us to submit and to comply and to believe that the actions of Allaah are perfect and complete and do not suffer any deficiency or shortcoming. So, even if some of the points of wisdom or the underlying reasons remain hidden to us then still we do not ask about them, rather, we submit. So, if we understand the wisdom and the underlying reason then this is fine but if we do not understand it then we submit and we do not raise objections to Allaah or withhold from action until we know the wisdom or the underlying reason.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[Listen to 32 (Part A) </strong></span><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/15/there-is-to-be-no-obedience-to-any-human-in-disobedience-to-allaah/">Here</a></strong><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And know, that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And whoever is from the people of Islaam then do not bear witness (of Paradise or the Fire) for him on account of his having done a deed, whether good or bad, since you do not know what his deeds will be concluded with at the point of death. You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">[only highlighted portion of the above point is covered in this post]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/bearing-witness-of-paradise-or-of-the-fire-for-a-specific-individual-without-a-proof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And witness (meaning regarding Paradise or the Fire) may not be given against anyone nor for him based upon his having done a good or bad deed.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter of bearing witness of Paradise or of the Fire for a specific individual, this is that matter. So witness is not given for a specific individual that he will be in Paradise nor is witness given that he will be in the Fire, except with a proof from the Book and the Sunnah. As for one who there is no proof to state that he is from the people of Paradise, even if he is a righteous person, a believer, we do not do so because we do not know what his concluding action will be. And likewise, a sinful person or a disbeliever, we do not state for certain that the individual that he is from the people of the Fire because he might repent and we do not know. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“One of you may perform the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit (forearm); but then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it. And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a forearm (a cubit) and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span> </strong>[06 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the concluding actions are not known except to Allaah, the Knower of all hidden things, He, the Perfect and Most High. But as for us, then we have fear for the people of sins and we have hope for the people of acts of obedience but we do not state with certainty. Rather, we have hope for those who are obedient but we do not state with certainty, and we have fear for the sinful ones but we do not state with certainty. This is with regard to specific individuals. As for in general, then we state with certainty that the people of eemaan (true belief) are the people of Paradise and we state with certainty that the disbelievers are the people of the Fire. Allaah, the Most High, said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for the disbelievers.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for those who have taqwaa (those who are fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him).</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is with regard to in general. As for specific individuals and specific people, then this is entrusted to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, we behave and deal with them on the basis of what is apparent. We deal with the people of obedience in accordance with what appears from them and we deal with the people of sins in accordance to what is apparent from them. We pass judgement in accordance with what is apparent only, not stating the final destination and the final outcome, for that lies in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [07]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6594) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 2643) from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the famous hadeeth of as-Saadiq al-Masdooq, the fourth hadeeth in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the wording of a hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> dealt with a point, which wasn’t dealt with here directly: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And there is no sin except that the servant can repent from it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “At-Towbah (repentance) is acceptable from every sin with regard to the rulings relating to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Translator’s note:</strong> meaning, in the Hereafter that would be wiped away from him. When `Amr ibn al-`Aas came to accept Islaam and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> told him to put out his hand to give his pledge &#8211; that’s when he withheld it for a moment. He said, “Because I want to make a condition.” So the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> asked him what condition he wanted to make. He said, “What I did before should be forgiven.” So therefore the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said the hadeeth the shaykh quotes here.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet s<em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu `anhu,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Do you not know that Islaam demolishes what came before it and that performing Hijrah demolishes what came before it and that the Hajj demolishes what came before it.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Muslim (121) in the Book of Eemaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And his saying with regard to the man who killed ninety-nine men, ‘And who can come between him and between repentance?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The hadeeth reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the ahaadeeth in this regard are very clear. And the disagreement is with regard to a person who spoke with words of abuse against the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or against the Qur·aan &#8211; is his repentance accepted with regard to this world or is judgement passed that he is to be executed, even if he makes clear his repentance? Then this has been clarified by Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah in his book As-Saarimul-Maslool `alaa Shaatimir-Rasool <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 16 : Point 14</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have Eemaan in seeing Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads. And He will bring them to account without any mediator </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> or any interpreter.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F364407587&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection-openly-with-their-eyes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the tremendous and important matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> is: <span style="font-size:1rem;">Affirmation of the fact that the true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes, just as they see the Moon on the night of the full Moon and just as they see the Sun clearly, not obscured by any clouds, as occurs in the authentic </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">ahaadith</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> which are </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;"><em>mutawaatir</em> </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission, so many that it is impossible to could have got together upon lie) affirming the believers seeing their Lord.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim brought in Haadiyul-Arwah (ilaa Bilaadil-Afraah) the hadeeth occurring about this. And he did so at great length, quoting their chains of narration; and they are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission) affirming that the believers will indeed see their Lord openly with their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance from the deviant sects, such as the Mu`tazilah and those who took their position, they opposed this and they denied ar-ru&#8217;yah (the Seeing, that the believers will indeed see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection). And it is something mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, will be al-husnaa</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the finest reward of Paradise)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and <em>ziyaadah</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(an increase)</span> [02] (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in Saheeh Muslim that the ziyaadah, the increase, is looking at the Face of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They shall have whatever they (the believers in Paradise) wish therein and with Us there is something extra.</span></strong>(Soorah Qaaf (50), aayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em><strong>al-mazeed</strong></em>, that which is extra, is looking at the Face of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there occurs in Sooratul-Qiyaamah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Some faces on that day (Day of Resurrection) will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Qiyamah(75), aayahs 22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Naadirah</em> with a <em>daad</em> from <em>an-nudrah</em>, radiance, which means that which is shining and beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will recognise upon their faces <em>nadrah</em> (the radiance) of bliss</strong></span> (Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;looking at their Lord</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With a <em>zaa</em>· (<em>naazirah</em>) meaning with their eyes. They will be looking at Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, feeling more joy at that than the joy which they experience on account of the bliss in Paradise. This occurs in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan. In Sooratul-Mutaffifeen He said with regard to the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But no, on that Day, the disbelievers will be screened away and prevented from seeing their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning screened and blocked from seeing Allaah. So if the disbelievers are blocked from seeing Allaah, then this is a proof that the believers will see their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. [04] And that is because the believers believed in Him in this world, yet they did not see Him. Rather they relied upon the evidences and therefore believed in Him. And they believed in His Messengers. So they believed in Him even though they did not see Him in this world. So therefore Allaah will honour them in Paradise that He will show Himself to them, so that they will see Him openly because they believed in Him in this world and did not see Him. But as for the disbelievers, because of the fact that they disbelieved in Him in this world, therefore Allaah will block them from seeing Him on the Day of Resurrection as a recompense (punishment) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">as a fully appropriate recompense.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naba· (78), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the false doubts which the Mu`tazilah rely upon, and those who held their saying, is that Allaah said to Moosaa: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">You shall not see Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Moosaa came to Our appointed place and His Lord spoke to Him, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moosaa)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> said O My Lord show Yourself to Me, so that I may look upon You. So He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah the Most High) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said You will not see Me. However look at the mountain. So if it remains settled in its place, then You will see Me</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, “And this is a proof that Allaah cannot be seen.” We say: Yes this is with regard to this world, because the event occurred in this world. We agree that Allaah cannot be seen in this world. So Moosaa asked to see Him in this world, so Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">He said You will not see Me </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211;</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> </span></strong>Meaning in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-nafee, negation, with <strong><em>Lan</em> </strong>(in Arabic it is negation of something that is occurring in the future) does not necessitate <em>ta&#8217;beed</em> (its being something forever). Rather it is a negation for a certain time. So (His saying) : <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said You will not see Me &#8211; </strong></span>Meaning, ‘You will not see Me in this world.’ And there occurs in the Arabic language that negating something with <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate its being forever (a negation forever). And therefore Ibnu Maalik [05] said in al-Kaafiyatush-Shaafiyah in nahw (Arabic grammar):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Whoever holds the opinion that negating something with Lan means forever, Then reject his saying and support other than it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate a negation that is forever. And the proof is also that Allaah said with regard to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then wish for death if you are truthful. But they will never wish for it</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 94-95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet it occurs that in the Hereafter they will indeed wish for death in order to be relieved from the torment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They will call out ‘O Maalik! Let Your Lord put an end to us’</span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), aayah 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will request death. So this proves that <em>Lan</em> does not mean negation without end. This is what is necessitated by the Arabic language and it is what is necessitated by what is indicated in the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say also that what proves that Allaah cannot be seen is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot encompass Him (Allaah) but He encompasses Sight</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say to them: this does not contain a negation of Seeing (ru·yah), rather it only negates totally encompassing (idraak). He did not say, “Sight will not see Him.” He said, &#8220;it will not encompass Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And denying <strong>encompassing</strong> is something different to denying <strong>seeing</strong>. So sight will see Him, however it will not encompass Him. So idraak means encompassing Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So Even though they will see Him in Paradise, they will not fully encompass Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So what is negated here is encompassing him. [06] So they will see Him but they will not fully encompass Him. They will see Him as is proven by the evidences. And harmonizing the texts is what is obligatory. If there are differences between texts, then as far as it is possible to harmonize between them, this must be done. And this is clear; and all Praise is for Allaah. And the Speech of Allaah can never contradict itself. Rather some parts of it explain other parts. As for the person who takes one aayah and abandons a different ayaah, then this is from the people of deviation. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So as for those people in whose hearts is deviation, then they follow that which is unclear, seeking discord and seeking to falsely interpret it</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So evidence is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan in totality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All of it is from our Lord</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the <em>raasikhoon</em> (those firmly grounded in knowledge) say. So the Qur&#8217;aan, some parts of it explain the rest. And there can never be any contradiction in it because Allaah has negated from it any contradiction. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not ponder/reflect upon the Qur&#8217;aan. If it had been from other than Allaah, they would certainly would have found in it many contradictions</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you have a problem in understanding an aayah, then you look into the Qur&#8217;aan for that which will explain it. And if you do not find that, then you go to the Sunnah to find that which will explain it in the Sunnah. And if you do not find its explanation in the Sunnah, then you go to the sayings of the Companions, those who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam, to find in their sayings that which will explain the aayah which you have a problem in understanding. The Qur&#8217;aan, and all Praise is for Allaah, is preserved in its wording and in its meaning. It neither opposes nor contradicts itself, rather contradictions only occur in the understandings of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise those false claimants to knowledge, those who did not truly study knowledge and did not take the principles of deriving evidence and of how to reach conclusions, they derive proof without understanding (fiqh). And they affirm things which no-one before them affirmed from the people of knowledge because of jahl, ignorance, and because of ta`aalum, pseudo-knowledge/false knowledge. So these are tremendous matters which require learning and require precision and require careful consideration and require verification, because the `aqeedah (creed and belief) is the foundation. And if there are deficiencies in it, this will be a deficiency in the foundation (of your religion). So in summary, this is the disagreement of the people with regard to seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic on the Day of Resurrection. So Allaah cannot be seen in this world. He will only be seen by the believers in the Hereafter. And He will be screened away from the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And having Eemaan in ar-ru&#8217;yah (seeing Him) on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong> Why did he say on the Day of Resurrection? Because He, the Majestic and Most High, cannot be seen in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads.”</strong> He said with the eyes of their heads to negate ta&#8217;weel, false interpretation/ misinterpretation, of those who say the meaning of ‘they will see their Lord’ means: with their hearts, not with their sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will bring them to account without any mediator and without any interpreter.”</strong> Meaning, on the Day of Resurrection at the <em>hisaab</em>, Reckoning, the servant will be in private with his Lord. And Allaah will call him to account for his deeds in his language which the servant will understand. There will be no interpreter between him and Him. The interpreter is one who conveys the meaning from one language to another language, like the one who conveys the meaning from the English language to the Arabic language or vice versa because the languages are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> ‘without any screen’ in some editions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Muhammad ibn Jareer At-Tabaree, the famous mufassir of the Qur&#8217;aan, explained this part of the aayah by saying, “For those from His creation who performed the worship of Allaah well in this world, such that they obeyed Him with regard to what He commanded them and forbade them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 181) (in the Book of Eemaan) (Hadeeth of) Suhayb radiAllaahu `anh, from the Prophet sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, will say, ‘Do you wish for Me to give you any increase?’ So they will say, ‘Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire.’ He said: So then He will uncover the screen and they will not have been given anything which is more beloved to them than looking at their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">And then he recited this aayah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the best reward (of Paradise) and an increase (looking upon their Lord).</span></strong> (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee also said, that this is mentioned as being a punishment for the disbelievers that they will blocked, not able to see their Lord. So therefore the believers who will not be punished, this is affirmation that they will indeed see their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the people of knowledge mention a point that a person for example from a distance may see the walls of a town, but not see what is beyond the walls, he may see the town but he doesn’t see what is beyond the town, what is inside the town and all the details, all around the town from every aspect. He does not encompass the town he can just see the town. So there is a clear difference between idraak, totally encompassing something, and between seeing it.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> &amp; That They are Both Created</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] Ahl us-Sunnah testify and believe that Paradise and Hell are both created. They will remain eternally and the people of Paradise will never leave it. Also the inhabitants of Hell, who were created for it, will never come out of it. Death will be sacrificed on the wall between Paradise and Hell, then a call will be made that day:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..O people of Paradise, there is eternity and no death. O people of Hell, there is eternity and no death.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Believers Will See Their Lord In The Hereafter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] <em>Ahl us-Sunnah</em> believe and testify that the Believers will see their Lord, The Most Blessed and The Most High, on the Day of judgement with their eyes. They will look at Him, as it is reported in the authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> from the Messenger of Allaah, (صلى الله عليه وسلم). He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, you will see your Lord like you see the full Moon. ”</span> </em>[105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comparison (like) mentioned in this hadeeth is between the two (seeing’s) not between that which is seen in each case.[106] The <em>ahaadeeth</em> of the vision are related in the book <em>al-Intisaar</em> with all the <em>asaaneed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[105] Related by Ibn Khuzaimah in <em>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</em> [ 1:407-411 ]. See also al-Bukhaaree [554], Muslim [183l and Aboo Dawood [ 4729 ]. The Prophet, (صلى الله عليه وسلم ), said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Most Mighty and the Most Majestic, will say: ‘<strong>Do you wish for anything extra that I may give you</strong>?’ They will say: Have you not brightened our faces? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the fire? So He will remove the screen and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them, than looking at their Lord, the Most Mighty and the Most Majestic.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Related by Muslim [181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[106] i.e The similarity between seeing the full moon and seeing Allaah is in the seeing, not between the full moon and Allaah. This fine point is a refutation on those who claim that Ahl us Sunnah here have made a comparison between Allaah and His creation ( i.e. the full moon).</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Hawd &amp; The Kawthar (The Pool &amp; The River)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] They believe in the Hawd [102] and the Kawthar. Also in the entering of a group of Ahl ut-Tawheed into Paradise without account. There will also be a group from them who will have an easy reckoning, without any harm befalling them, or any punishment overtaking them. A group from them who had sinned will enter the Fire, then they will be freed and led out of it and joined up with their brothers who preceded them in entering Paradise. [103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They ( i.e. Ahl Hadeeth ) know with certainty and truth that the sinful from amongst the Ahl ut Tawlieed will not remain in the Fire eternally, and will not be left there forever. [104] As for the unbelievers, they shall abide in Hell forever and never come out of it nor shall they ever be reprieved. Allaah will never leave in the Fire anyone, who was disobedient from Ahl ul-Eemaan.</p>

<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 20: The Outcome of the Slaves is Unknown</strong></span></p>
<p>[115] The People of <em>Hadeeth</em> believe and testify that the end of the slave is unknown. No one knows what his end shall be. They (People of <em>Hadeeth</em>) do not pass judgement on a specific person that he will be from the people of Paradise or from the people of Hell, because that is something which is hidden from them. They do not know in which state a person will die, whether it is upon <em>Islaam</em> or unbelief, so due to this fact they say:</p>
<p>“Indeed we are Believers, if Allaah wills.”</p>
<p>That is, from those Believers who will have a good end, if Allaah wills [134]</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[134] TRANSLATORS NOTE ~ The Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم), said:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not be delighted by the actions of anyone until you see how he ends up&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">Related by Ahmad [ 3:120,223 ] and lbn Abee ‘Aasim [ 393-395 ]. The isnaad is Saheeh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 21: The Ruling Upon On One Who Died Upon Belief Or Unbelief</strong></span></p>
<p>[l16] And the People of <em>Hadeeth</em> witness for the one who dies upon <em>Islaam</em> that his end will be Paradise even if their fate was written by Allaah that they will be punished with the Fire for a period, as a result of their sins which they committed and did not repent from. They will eventually enter Paradise and no one from amongst the Muslims will remain in Hell eternally. This is a great blessing and favour from Allaah. If one dies upon unbelief, and Allaah’s protection is sought from this, he will be thrown into the Fire and he will not be saved from it, and he will stay there forever.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Chapter 26 : You Will Not Enter Paradise By Your Deeds Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[131] The People of Hadeeth believe and testify that no one is entitled to Paradise, even if he had performed good deeds and his worship was the most sincere, or his obedience was the purest obedience and his way was a pleasing one, unless Allaah favours him, thereby granting it to him, through His Blessings and Graciousness. Since the good deeds which the person performed was not made easy for him except by the facilitation of Allaah, Mighty is His Name. So if He had not facilitated it for him, the person would not have been able to accomplish this deed and (similarly) if He did not guide him to it he would never have accomplished it out of his own effort and exhoflation. Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَدًا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And had it not been for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.&#8221;</span> (An-Nur 24:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلَا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And they will say, &#8220;Praise to Allah , who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.&#8221;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf 7:43)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>20 &#8211; Exiting from the Fire for those who Worshipped Allaah Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">225 – When the believers will have finished from the fire on the Day of Judgment and become secure. Then one of you arguing for the truth, in the Duniya for his companion will not be more intense than the debating of the believers with their Lord, regarding their brothers whom had been entered into the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: they will say:<strong> Our Lord! These are our brothers they used to pray along with us, and fast along with us, and perform the Hajj along with us, and you have entered them into the fire</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: that Allaah will say: &#8220;go and take out those whom you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will come to them, and they will know them by their faces. The fire would not have eaten their faces. From amongst them there will be, he whom the fire has reached half way up his shins, and he whom the fire has reached to his ankles, and they will take them out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will say: &#8220;We took out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: &#8220;Take out he who has the weight of a dirham of Emaan in his heart. Then the one who has the weight of half a dirham,&#8217; until He says: He who has an atom’s weight in his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;eed said: whoever does not believe this, then let him read this Ayaah : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allaah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from him a great reward</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: The Believers will say: &#8220;O our Lord! Indeed we have taken out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8217; Then there will not remain anyone in the fire who has good in himself.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Then Allaah will say: the Angels have interceded, and the Prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded and The Most Merciful of those who shows mercy remains.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said : Then Allaah will grab a handful from the fire &#8211; or He said : two handfuls &#8211; of people who never did any good for Allaah at all, indeed they will be burnt so much that they will have become charcoal.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: they will be brought to water, which is said to be called the water of life. It will be poured on them they will sprout out like the seed sprouts after what is left over by the torrential floods, they will come out of their bodies like pearls, and they will have a stamp on their necks, saying: those freed by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: it will be said to them: Enter into Paradise, whatever you wish for or anything you see then it is for you, and I have something with Me which is better than that. He said: They will say: Our Lord! What can be better than this?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Allaah will say: My being pleased with you, I will never be angry with you.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1661- &#8220;Indeed Allaah Azza wa Jal will take out a people from the fire after nothing remains of them except for their faces and Allaah will enter them into Paradise.&#8221; The hadeeth is in saheeh al-Bukhari (4/463-464) by a different narration on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed in a narration ascribed to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and he mentions the whole of the hadeeth of the intercession; and in it, is stated: &#8220;Allaah Ta&#8217;aala will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Go to those whom you find in their hearts the equivalent to a dinar of Emaan and take them out of the fire, Allaah prohibits the fire from their faces…</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1450 &#8211; &#8220;Take out of the fire whoever has in his heart the equivalent of an atom worth of Emaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1451- &#8220;Some people from the people of Tawheed will be punished in the fire, until they will be like charcoal, then mercy will reach them. They will be taken out and thrown at the doors of Paradise. He said: then the people of Paradise will sprinkle water upon them, they will sprout like seeds left over, sprouts after the torrential floods, then they will enter paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Certainly the most excellent favor and the most complete blessing for the people of paradise is seeing their Lord, The Most Greatest, The One Who Possesses, honor and beauty. This is the delight of their hearts and the comfort of their eyes, the greatest bliss and pleasure in the abode of delight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was narrated by Muslim in his saheeh on the authority of Suhayb, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">When the people of paradise enter the paradise Allaah the Blessed and Most High will say: &#8220;Do you desire an increase in anything?&#8221; The people will say: &#8220;Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into the paradise and saved us from the fire?!&#8221; He (the Prophet) said: ‘He (Allaah) will then remove the covering and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.’ </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a connection between seeing Allaah and the prayer. Whoever is from the people who establish prayer, then he is much deserving of this favor. And the one who is neglectful (of the prayer) then he is worthy of being deprived (of this favor) and will be from the people of loss. Certainly, this connection is substantiated by the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, Allaah says:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">“Faces that Day will radiant (22) Looking towards their Lord, (23) And many faces, that day, will be gloomy, (24) Realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them. (25) Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles, (26) And it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)” (27) And he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,) (28) And one shank is intertwined with the other shank, (29) Then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven. (30) So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed, (31) But rejected the truth and turned away (from it)(32)”</span> (75:22-32)</p>



<p>So His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Faces that day will be radiant&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:22)<br />Meaning; from the beauty, meaning a beautiful radiance; brightly pleased. And His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Looking at their Lord&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:23)<br />Meaning: by seeing Him with their eyes, by their vision.</p>



<p>Hasan al-Basri said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8216;They have the right to be radiant while they are looking at the Creator. Then Exalted is He, mentioned another category (of people) the people whose faces will be contorted, completely gloomy. He mentioned from among their actions was abandonment of the prayer. This shows that the people of the first category are the people of radiance and are those who will see Allaah. These are from the people who establish the prayer.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>As for (evidence from) the Sunnah</strong>, then in the two Saheeh&#8217;s, on the authority of Jareer ibn Abdillaah, who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he looked towards the moon on a full-moon night and said afterwards: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him. So if you are able to not be occupied and overcome by things which will distract you from the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets then do so!&#8217;</span> Meaning the Asr prayer and the Fajr. Then Jareer recited (the verse) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And praise your Lord before the sun rise and before the sunset&#8221;</span> (20:130)</p>



<p>In this hadeeth is an indication to the connection between the prayer and seeing (Allaah).</p>



<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;It is said as it relates to the command with preserving these two prayers coming immediately after mention of the seeing (of Allaah) that the greatest (loftiest) thing in paradise is seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and the most noble of actions in the life of this world are these two prayers. Therefore in guarding them it is hoped that the person will enter Paradise and will see Allaah there.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there is no doubt that the companions when they heard the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him&#8217;</span>, a great yearning filled their souls and a wondering about the actions which will be the cause of obtaining this greatly sought pursuit. And from the excellence of the Prophet&#8217;s advice and completeness of his clarification, he answered it without being asked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this is an indication from him (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) that, seeing Allaah on the Day of Judgment will not be obtained by merely wishing. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is not a matter of your merely wishing or the wishing of the People of the Book&#8221;</span> (4:123) Rather it is a must to perform actions, be upright, strive hard and have full commitment to Allaah. For this reason the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained the means which will allow the servant to obtain seeing Allaah. Therefore he directed to two great prayers, namely Fajr and Asr. Many texts have been narrated in relation to the matter of these two (prayers) which point to their virtues. They are mentioned specifically for what is contained in them of great virtues and from the weightiness (of them) upon many people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Therefore whoever elevates his concern and Allaah assists him and gives him success in preserving these two prayers then he must be much more preserving of the other prayers (as well) rather the Fajr prayer specifically, (as it ) is the commencement of the day. Whoever Allaah honors with getting up to perform this prayer and giving importance to it will be aided for the remaining prayers of that day. For how the servant acts in relation to the Fajr prayer applies (to his actions) for the rest of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As some of the Salaf would say: <strong>&#8220;Your day is like your camel; if you take hold of the beginning of it then the later part of it will follow you&#8221; </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the Prophet&#8217;s statement:<strong> &#8220;Do not become occupied…&#8221;</strong> Is an indication that in this life are many affairs that will distract and divert man from guarding these two prayers. And how much more are the things that divert in these days of ours! There are people whom drinking tea overcomes and diverts from these prayers which is the beauty of this worldly life. Some are distracted by petty conversation, immoral night chat, useless entertainment and evil viewings. And also from people are those whom sleep overcomes, and so on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this Hadeeth also is evidence that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>correct sound belief</strong> </span>affects the actions of the slave and his ways. So the more his faith increases and his certainty strengthens, the more he increases in uprightness, diligence, (righteous) work, and observing the obedience of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And because of this connection between the prayer and seeing Allaah our Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of his prayer before tasleem for this great delight and wealthy reward. Narrated by an-Nasai in his sunan on the authority of Ataa ibn as-Saaib from his father who said: &#8220;Ammaar bin Yaasir led us in prayer and he shorted it. So some of the people said to him:&#8217;you have made the prayer light or shorted it! He said: &#8216;As for that, I was supplicating with some supplications I heard from the Messenger of Allaah. So he when he stood a man from the people followed him, he was Ubay though he didn&#8217;t reveal his name and asked him about the supplication then the man came (back) and informed the people of it. (The supplication was)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah, by Your Knowledge of the unseen and by Your Power over the creation , let me live if You know that life is good for me , and let me die if You know that death is good for me . O Allaah , I ask You to grant me fear of You in private and in the open . I ask you for the word of truth in times of contentment and anger. I ask You for moderation in wealth and in poverty. I ask you for blessings never ceasing and the coolness of my eye (i.e. pleasure) that never ends. I ask You for pleasure after Your Judgment and I ask You for a life of coolness after death. I ask You for the delight of looking at Your Face and the earning of meeting You without any harmful distress and misleading trials befalling me. O Allah, dress us with the beauty of Faith, and make us guides who are upon (correct) guidance. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah favor us all with guarding the prayer. We ask Allaah for the delight of looking at His Face and the yearning to meet Him without any harmful distress or misleading trial.</p>



<p>We ask Allaah to make this a benefit for us and for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In what language will the people be spoken to on the Day of Resurrection? Will Allaah Ta’ala speak to the people in Arabic? Is it true that the language of the people of Hell-fire will be Persian and the language of the people of Paradise will be Arabic?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the worlds, it is not known in what language the people will be spoken to on that day, nor in which language they will hear the address of the Lord <em>–Jala wa Ula’-</em>because Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> did not inform us of anything about this, nor did His Messenger<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not authentic that Persian is the language of the people of the Hell-fire <strong><em>or</em></strong> that Arabic is the language of the people who will be in eternal blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know of a dispute between the Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em>, rather all of them refrained from this, because speaking about these types of things is from futile speech . . . However, there occurred a dispute between the people who came later so some of them said that: the people will converse in Arabic. Others said: ‘No, the people of Hell-fire will reply in Persian and it is their language in Hell-fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others said: ‘They will converse with Syriac<em> (</em>an Eastern Aramaic language) because it is the language of Adam and from it all other languages branched off.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others said: ‘No, the people of Paradise will speak Arabic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no basis any of these opinions by those who hold them, neither intellectual nor transmitted, rather it is a claim devoid of evidence and Allaah <em>– Subhana wa Ta’ala –</em> is most Knowledgeable and most Just.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 4/300-301</p>

Chapter 372<br />
Some of the Bounties which Allah has prepared for the Believers in Paradise</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Truly, the Muttaqun (the pious and righteous persons) will be amidst Gardens and water-springs (Jannah). (It will be said to them): `Enter therein (Jannah), in peace and security.&#8217; And We shall remove from their breasts any deep feeling of bitterness (that they may have). (So they will be like) brothers facing each other on thrones. No sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it</b></span><b>.&#8221; (15:45-48)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>(It will be said to the believers of Islamic Monotheism): `My slaves! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve. (You) who believed in Our Ayat (proofs, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and were Muslims (i.e., who submit totally to Allah&#8217;s Will, and believe in the Oneness of Allah). Enter Jannah, you and your wives, in happiness.&#8217; Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them; (there will be) therein all that inner-selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever. This is the Jannah which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world). Therein for you will be fruits in plenty, of which you will eat (as you desire).</b></span><b>&#8221; (43:68-73)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, the Muttaqun (the pious), will be in place of security (Jannah). Among Gardens and springs. Dressed in fine silk and (also) in thick silk, facing each other. So (it will be). And We shall marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes. They will call therein for every kind of fruit in peace and security. They will never taste death therein except the first death (of this world), and He will save them from the torment of the blazing Fire. As a bounty from your Rubb! That will be the supreme success!</b></span><b>&#8221; (44:51-57)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Verily, Al-Abrar (the pious and righteous) will be in Delight (Jannah). On thrones, looking (at all things). You will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight. They will be given to drink of pure sealed wine. The last thereof (that wine) will be the smell of musk, and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive (i.e., hasten earnestly to the obedience of Allah). It (that wine) will be mixed with Tasnim. A spring whereof drink those nearest to Allah</b></span><b>.&#8221; (83:22-28)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic Ayat on the subject are many and well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1880.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The inhabitants of Jannah will eat and drink therein, but they will not have to pass excrement, to blow their noses or to urinate. Their food will be digested producing belch which will give out a smell like that of musk. They will be inspired to declare the freedom of Allah from imperfection and proclaim His Greatness as easily as you breathe</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1881.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Exalted, has said: `I have prepared for my righteous slaves what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and the mind of no man has conceived.&#8217; If you wish, recite</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`<span style="color:#ff0000;">No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do</span>.&#8221;&#8217; (32:17)<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1882.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The first group (of people) to enter Jannah will be shining like the moon on a full-moon night. Then will come those who follow them who will be like the most shining planet in the sky. They will not stand in need of urinating or relieving of nature or of spitting or blowing their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat will smell like musk; in their censers the aloes-wood will be used. Their wives will be large eyed maidens. All men will be alike in the form of their father `Adam, sixty cubits tall</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Their utensils will be of gold, their perspiration will smell like musk; everyone of them will have two wives; the marrow of the bones of the wives&#8217; legs will be seen through the flesh out of excessive beauty. They (i.e., the people of Jannah) will neither have difference, nor enmity (hatred) amongst themselves; their hearts will be as if one heart, and they will be glorifying Allah in the morning and in the afternoon</span>.&#8221;<br />

It will be said to him: Enter Jannah. But he will say: O my Rubb! How should I enter while the people have settled in their apartments and taken their shares? It will be said to him: Will you be satisfied and pleased if you have a kingdom like that of a monarch of the world? He will say: I will be content, my Rubb. Allah will say: For you is that, and like that and like that and like that and like that. He will say at the fifth time: I am well-pleased, my Rubb. Allah will say: It is for you and ten times more like it. You will have whatever your soul desires and whatever your eyes could delight in. He will say: I am well-pleased, my Rubb.&#8217; Musa (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: `Who will be of the highest rank in Jannah.&#8217; Allah said: `They are those whom I chose and I established their honour with My Own Hand.

It would be a feast arranged in the honour of the people of Paradise. He (the narrator) further narrated that a person from among the Jews came and he said: Abu al-Qasim, may the Compassionate Lord be pleased with you! May I inform you about the feast arranged in honour of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection? He said: Do it, of course. He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became visible. He then again said: May I inform you about that with which they would season it? He said: Do it, of course. He said: Their seasoning would be balim and fish. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: What is this balam? He said: Ox and fish from whose excessive livers seventy thousand people would be able to eat.</p>

Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:&#8221; I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble,&#8221; and when Allah&#8217;s Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent&#8221; up to the words:&#8221; you are going to return to (evil).&#8221; (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur&#8217;an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution&#8221; (xliv. 16)?

This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone.

Munabbih reported that Abu Huraira narrated to them some ahadith of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and one of them is this that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Paradise and the Hell fell into dispute and the Hell said: 1 have been distinguished for accommodating (the haughty and proud in me), and the Paradise said: What is the matter that the meek and the humble and the downtrodden and simple would find an abode in me? Thereupon Allah said to Paradise: You are a (means) of My Mercy. 1 shall show mercy through you to one whom I will from amongst My servants. And lie said to the Hell: You are a (sign) of My chastisement and I shall chastise through you anyone whom I will from amongst My servants and both of you, would be full. And as regards the Hell it would not be full until Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, places His foot therein, and it would say: Enough, enough, enough, and it would be then full and the one part would draw very close to the other one and Allah would not treat unjustly anyone amongst His creation and He would create another creation for the Paradise (to accommodate it).</p>

(He has instructed thus): The property which I have conferred upon them is lawful for them. I have created My servants as one having a natural inclination to the worship of Allah but it is Satan who turns them away from the right religion and he makes unlawful what has been declared lawful for them and he commands them to ascribe partnership with Re, although he has no justification for that. And verily, Allah looked towards the people of the world and He showed hatred for the Arabs and the non-Arabs, but with the exception of some remnants from the People of the Book. And He (further) said: I have sent thee (the Holy Prophet) in order to put you to test and put (those to test) through you. And I sent the Book to you which cannot be washed away by water, so that you may recite it while in the state of wakefulness or sleep. Verily, Allah commanded me to burn (kill) the Quraish. I said: My Lord, they would break my head (like the tearing) of bread, and Allah said: You turn them out as they turned you out, you fight against them and We shall help you in this, you should spend and you would be conferred upon. You send an army and I would send an army five times greater than that. Fight against those who disobey you along with those who obey you. The inmates of Paradise are three: One who wields authority and is just and fair, one who Is truthful and has been endowed with power to do good deeds. And the person who is merciful and kind hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and one who does not stretch his hand in spite of having a large family to support. And He said: The inmates of Hell are five: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil), the (carefree) who pursue (everything irrespective of the fact that it is good or evil) and who do not have any care for their family or for their wealth. And those dishonest whose greed cannot be concealed even in the case of minor things. And the third. who betray you. morning and evening, in regard to your family and your property. He also made a mention of the miser and the liar and those who are in the habit of abusing people and using obscene and foul language. Abu Ghassan in his narration did not make mention of&#8221; Spend and there would be spent for you.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;" align="center">By the <i>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </i>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
<span lang="EN-GB">Translated by </span>Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><strong> The questioner:</strong> &#8216;Regarding the Hadeeth &#8216;What is between my house and my <i>Mimber</i> is a garden from the gardens of Paradise&#8217;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Is the intent a multiplication of reward or is it for blessings?&#8217;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani </strong><i><span lang="EN-GB">-Rahimullaah- </span></i> answered:<i></i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The intent of this Hadeeth is not for the people to pounce and attack this place as they do nowadays and that they crowd around for the prayer in this place which the Messenger <i>-alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam-</i> described that it is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, this Hadeeth is information of the unseen which is obligatory to believe in, that this place is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, how? I swear by Allaah I do not know how.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Many of the scholars say that it will be in Paradise on the Day of Judgement, that is why it is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, it is possible that this is the case and it is possible that the case is something else, we do not comprehend this Hadeeth, just like other Ahadeeth, for example:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" dir="RTL" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span lang="AR-SA" style="color:#545454;">جبل أحد يحبنا</span><span dir="LTR" style="color:#545454;"> </span><span lang="AR-SA" style="color:#545454;">ونحبه</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Mount Uhud is a mountain which loves us and we love it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">This does not mean that you intend that place in itself and seek blessings from it,  and pray there, no, this is just information we believe in, Mount Uhud loves us and we love it, similarly for example:</p>
<p dir="RTL" align="center"><span lang="AR-SA">أحد</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">ركن</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">من</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">أركان</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">الجنة</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Mount Uhud is a pillar from the pillars of Paradise.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">This also does not have the same meaning which we have mentioned,i.e. that you intend that place in itself, seeking blessings from it and to pray there, no, this is information of the unseen. It was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>so we believe in this, and we do not carry this meaning to be a legislated action in the Sharia&#8217; so that we worship Allaah by that, since our righteous Salaf did not explain this, not by their speech or by their actions.&#8217;<i></i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">[Taken from: &#8216;Silsilah Huda wa Noor&#8217; tape 93 at <span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">00:45:06</span>]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Gardens of perpetual bliss &#8211; they shall enter them, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses and their offspring. And angels shall enter upon them every gate.&#8221; [ar-Ra`d, 13:23 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is a reminder. Verily, for the righteous is a beautiful place of [final] return &#8211; gardens of eternity, whose doors will [always] be open to them.&#8221; [Saad, 38:49-50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds, until behold, they arrive there. Its gates will be opened, and its keepers will say, &#8216;Peace be upon you!&#8217; Well have you done, do enter it, abiding [in it] eternally.&#8221; [Az-Zumar, 39:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa`d reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8221; Paradise has eight gates, and one of them is called ar-Rayyaan, through which none will enter but those who observe fasting.&#8221; [al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever spends two things in the way of Allah will be called from the gates of Paradise and will be addressed, &#8216;Oh slave of Allah, here is prosperity!&#8217; So whoever was among the people who used to offer their prayers will be called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever was among the people who used to participate in jihad will be called from the gate of jihad; and whoever was among those who used to observer fasts will be called from the gate of ar-Rayyaan;<br />
and whoever was among those who used to give charity will be called from the gate of charity.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you, oh Allah&#8217;s Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will be called from those gates. Will there be anyone who will be called from all these gates?&#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be one of them.&#8221; [al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqba ibn `Aamir said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were entrusted with the task of tending the camels. On my turn, when I came back in the evening after grazing them in the pastures, I found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) stand and address the people. I heard these words of his, &#8216;If any Muslim performs ablution well, then stands and prays two rak`ahs, setting about them with his heart as well as his face, Paradise will be guaranteed to him.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What a fine thing this is!&#8217; A narrator who was before me said, &#8216;The first was even better than this.&#8217; When I cast a glance, I saw that it was `Umar who said, &#8216;I see that you have just come and observed. If anyone among you performs the ablution, completes the ablution well and says, &#8220;I testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the servant of Allah and His Messenger,&#8221; then the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he may enter by whichever of them he wishes.&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The gates of Paradise will be opened on Monday and on Thursdays, and every servant [of Allah] who associates nothing with Allah will be forgiven, except for the man who has a grudge against his brother. [About them] it will be said, &#8216;Delay these two until they are reconciled. Delay these two until they are reconciled. Delay these two until they are reconciled.'&#8221; [Muslim, Maalik, Abu Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everlasting Life in Paradise</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Descriptions of Paradise from the Qur&#8217;aan and Hadeeth<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden, abiding in it eternally.&#8221; [2:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There, no sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shay they [ever] be evicted.&#8221; [15:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They will not taste death therein, except the first death, and He will preserve them from the penalty of the Blazing Fire. [It will be] a bounty from your Lord. That will be the supreme achievement!&#8221; [44:56-57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for those who believe and work righteous deeds, they will have the gardens of Paradise as hospitality. Eternally therein, they will not desire any other [place].&#8221; [18:107-108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Their Lord gives them glad tidings of a mercy from Himself and good pleasure and of gardens for them wherein is lasting enjoyment.&#8221; [9:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah reported that Allah’s Apostle (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who gets into Paradise [will be made to enjoy such an everlasting] bliss that he will neither become destitute nor will his clothes wear out nor will his youthfulness decline.&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa`eed al-Khudree and Abu Hurayrah both narrated that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There will be an announcer [in Paradise] who will make this announcement, ‘Verily, there is in store for you [everlasting] health. You will never fall ill, and you will live [forever] and never die. You will remain young and never grow old. You will always live in affluent circumstances and never become destitute.’ [This is explained in] the words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, ‘And it will be announced to them, ‘This is the Paradise you have been made to inherit for what you used to do.’’[7:43]&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa`eed reported that Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Death will be brought on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a white-colored ram.&#8221; [Abu Kuraib made the addition, &#8220;Then it will be made to stand between Paradise and Hell.&#8221; So far as the rest of the hadeeth is concerned, there is perfect agreement between narrators.] &#8220;It will be said to the people of Paradise, ‘Do you recognize this?’ They will raise up their necks, look towards it and say, ‘Yes, it is death.’ Then a command will be given to slaughter it, and it will be said, ‘O people of Paradise, there is everlasting life for you and no death.’ Then [addressing] the people of Hellfire, it will be said, ‘O people of Hellfire, there is everlasting life for you and no death.’&#8221; Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) then recited the following verse pointing wit his hand to this [material] world: &#8220;Warn them of the day of regret, when their affairs will be decided. They are unmindful, and they do not believe.&#8221; [19:39] [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It will be said to the people of Paradise, ‘O people of Paradise, eternity [for you] and no death!’ To the people of the Fire [it will be said], ‘O people of the Fire, eternity [for you] and no death!’&#8221; [Al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Road to Paradise<br />
Dr. `Abdullah al-Shimemeri</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Descriptions of Paradise from the Qur&#8217;aan and Hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly the ultimate goal of every Muslim is Paradise. As with all aspects of the Unseen, it can be only imagined through analogy, yet its realities are far beyond description in any human language. Allah (subhaanahu wa ta`aala) has prepared for His servants, &#8220;what no eye has seen and no ear has heard and has never occurred to a human heart.&#8221; [al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others] This eternal home is not limited to what is described here of material and spiritual enjoyments, for it includes &#8220;all the soul has longed for&#8221; and finally, the greatest and most complete pleasure beyond all imagination &#8211; the presence and nearness of the Creator Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who are the inheritors of such blessing? Who are the souls worthy of such reward?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is common belief among Muslims today that anyone who professes &#8220;La Ilaha ill-Allah&#8221; and &#8220;Muhammadun Rasoolullah&#8221; will enter Paradise. Yet this testimony is more than a statement of the tongue. It is an oath, a commitment that must be fulfilled. It has conditions and requirements which affect all aspects of life. It concerns authority &#8211; what actually governs our behavior and deeds. The Arabs of Quraish who refused to pronounce this kalimah did so because they fully understood its implications. Yet Muslims repeat it today without a second thought, their actions and lifestyles bearing witness to something totally different. And they expect Paradise!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Qur&#8217;aan, Allah (swt) has warned against complacency in religion like that of the Jews and Christians who mistakenly claim that God has favored them over others and that Paradise is theirs alone: &#8220;It is not by your wishes, nor the wishes of the People of the Scriptures. Whoever does a wrong shall be punished for it, and he will not find other than Allah as a protector or helper.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet many of today&#8217;s Muslims consider themselves a chosen people, while neglecting the commands of their Lord, turning their backs on the sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him) and insisting on a secular life far from the blessings of divine law&#8230; perhaps even going so far as to deny certain aspects of that law. Customs and traditions, materialism, man-made social systems, national leaders and even their own inclinations are now sharing the authority which rightfully belongs exclusively to our Creator, Owner of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward of Paradise is too great not to have a price. That price is true faith which is proven by obedience to Allah and His Messenger. The Qur&#8217;aan states, &#8220;And whoever desires the Hereafter and exerts the effor due to it while being a believer &#8211; those are the ones whose effort is appreciated [by Allah].&#8221; [17:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must return to the Qur&#8217;aan, not simply in an emotional or academic manner, but with a sense of instruction for obedience and action. We must find out what kind of people Allah has asked us to be and then become as such. This is the road to Paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-10 Verses of Al-Momin Surah<br />
</strong><strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is Jannat ul Firdaus?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who shall inherit Firdaws? (1-10 Verses of Al-Monin Surah)</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Successful indeed are the believers.</li>
<li>Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un (with fear and with tranquillity).</li>
<li>And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.</li>
<li>And those who pay the Zakah.</li>
<li>And those who guard their private parts.</li>
<li>Except from their wives or their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame.</li>
<li>But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.</li>
<li>Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants are Ra`un.</li>
<li>And those who strictly guard their Salawat.</li>
<li>These are indeed the heirs.</li>
<li>Who shall inherit <strong>Firdaws</strong>. They shall dwell therein forever.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Success is for the believers whose qualities are described here</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Successful indeed are the believers) means, they have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">***These are the believers who have the following characteristics ***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said: &#8220;(Khashi`un) means those with<strong> fear and with tranquillity</strong>.&#8221; This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the <strong>Khushu` of the heart.</strong> This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &#8220;Their Khushu` was in their hearts.&#8221; So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasai from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says: (<em><strong>And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity</strong></em>)[25:72].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: &#8220;By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who pay the Zakah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah: (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) [91:9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one&#8217;s wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: (they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that) meaning, other than a wife or slave girl, (then those are the transgressors.) meaning , aggressors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah said: (The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;I asked the Messenger of Allah , `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah&#8217; He said, (Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Kindness to one&#8217;s parents. ) I said, `Then what&#8217; He said,(Jihad in the way of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: &#8220;At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said: (Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu&#8217; except the believer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said: (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:(These are indeed the heirs.) &#8220;The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said: (Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said: (When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, &#8220;This is your ransom from the Fire.&#8221;) `</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah&#8217;s saying: (Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) [19:63] (This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) [43:72]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah News Letter<br />
Safar 1417H / July 1996 , Issue No.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing Paradise, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah will enter those who believe and do righteous and correct actions into Paradise, beneath which rivers flow. Wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments will be made of silk.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hajj 24:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the pious and obedient ones will be in Paradise, amongst gardens and water-springs. It will be said to them: Enter! In peace and safety. And We shall remove from their hearts any ill-feeling, so they will be like brothers, facing each other on thrones. No sense of hardship shall touch them, and they will be of those who never leave.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hijr 15:45-46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Paradise</b>, that precious sanctity to which, throughout the ages, the Believers run towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Paradise</b>, a burning flame that was in the hearts of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors), a flame that spurred them to aim for the highest examples of velour in <i>jihaad</i> and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Paradise</b>, that noble goal which aspiring eyes are fixed towards and which yearning souls long for, in all times and in all places. They find worldly afflictions agreeable to them for the sake of achieving Paradise. Indeed, to enter into it and remain in it is considered the greatest goal for the Believers, and it is a hope which is kept in view throughout life&#8217;s journey. How often has Paradise been the incentive and a motivation for goodness and truth, despite the dangers, afflictions and thorns that lie along the path &#8211; even if it involves certain death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the case in the days of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, as Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> related: Once Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions proceeded towards Badr and arrived there before the disbelievers of Makkah. When the disbelievers arrived Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;None of you should proceed ahead of me in anything.&#8221;</i> The disbelievers then advanced towards us and Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Rise-up to enter Paradise, whose width is equal to the heavens and the earth.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umayr ibn al-Humaam al-Ansaaree <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: O Messenger of Allaah ! Is Paradise equal in width to the heavens and the earth? He said: <i>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</i> Umayr then exclaimed words of astonishment and excitement, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked him: <i>&#8220;What made you say these words of astonishment and excitement?&#8221;</i> He replied: O Messenger of Allaah ! Nothing but the desire to be amongst its inhabitants. Allaah&#8217;s Messeneger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> then said, <i>&#8220;Indeed, you are surely from amongst its inhabitants.&#8221;</i> So &#8216;Umayr then took some dates from his bag and began to eat them. Then he said: If I were to live until I have eaten all the dates, then indeed this life would be too long. He threw away the remaining dates which were with him and he fought until he was killed. 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the stance taken in later times:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, whilst in the presence of his enemy, narrated: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Indeed, the gates of Paradise are beneath the shade of swords.&#8221;</i> A man who was in a shabby condition got up and said: Abu Moosaa! did you hear this from the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>? So he said: Yes! He returned to his friend and said: I bid you salaam (a farewell greeting of peace). Then he broke the sheath of his sword, threw it away, then rushed into the thick of the enemy and fought them until he was slain. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;O my soul! It is not, except a few days of patience;<br />
As if the extent were but a few dreams.<br />
O my soul! Pass quickly on through this world;<br />
And leave it, for indeed life lies ahead of it.&#8221;</i> 4</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah<br />
Source:Majmoo‘-ul Fataawaa (vol. 7, pg. 677-679)<br />
Produced by:al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Prophet’s statement: <b>“Anyone who possesses a speck of pride (kibr) in his heart will not enter Paradise”</b> – Is this hadeeth specific only to the believers or (is it specific only to the) unbelievers? If we were to say that it is specific for the Believers then (is not) our statement trivial considering (the fact that) the believers shall enter Paradise due to their Eemaan. If, on the other hand, we were to say that the hadeeth is specific for the unbelievers then what is the relevance of the statement (since it is already known that the unbelievers shall not gain admission to Paradise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Another) authentically reported wording of (this particular version of the) hadeeth is, <b>“Anyone who possesses half a mustard seed of Pride (kibr) in his heart will not be granted admission to Paradise. And anyone who possesses half a mustard seed of Eemaan will not enter the (Eternal) Fire.”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kibr that openly opposes and negates Eemaan results in the banishment of the one who holds it from entering al-Jannah as is found in Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And your Lord said: &#8220;Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn (yastakbiroon – Have kibr) My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221;</b> [Surah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Kibr of Iblees (the Devil), Pharaoh and all the others who possessed the Kibr, which invalidated Eemaan. This is also the Kibr that the Jews possess and those whom Allaah has described to us by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some, you disbelieved and some, you killed.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Kibr, in its entirety, openly opposes the essentials of al-Eemaan. As such he who has an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart will not act upon that which Allaah has prescribed, nor will he abstain from that which Allaah has prohibited. Instead his Kibr shall result in his disavowal and rejection of the truth and instill in him contempt of others. This, precisely, is the explanatory definition of al-Kibr provide by the Prophet as is found in the complete version of the initial Hadeeth [<b>“The one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Paradise.”</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was asked: “[But] O Messenger of Allaah! A man likes to have fine clothing and footwear. Is this included in Kibr?” He responded, “No. Allaah is Beauty and loves Beauty. Kibr is the rejection of truth (<i>Batrul-Haqq</i>) and condescension of others (<i>waa ghaamtun-naas</i>).” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement “<i>Batarul-Haqq</i>” denotes distain and rejection of the Truth, while “<i>ghaamtun-naas</i>” implies contempt and condescension of others from amongst mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the one who possesses half a mustard seed of it (Kibr) rejects the Truth that he was ordered to accept and act upon. At the same time, the Kibr instills in him a sense of condescension that inculcates in the individual an oppressive demeanor producing transgression over the rights of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who neglects his obligations (due to his rejection of them) and is oppressive to others from amongst the creation is not to be amongst the people of Jannah (while in this state), or deserving of it. On the contrary, such an individual is to be counted amongst the people who are threatened with punishment!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b> “Anyone who possesses a speck of Kibr in his heart will not be granted admission to Paradise”</b> implies that the individual is not from the people of Jannah and is not deserving of it. But if he repents, or he possesses <i>Hasaanaat</i> (righteous deeds) that expiate his sins, or Allaah has given him <i>Ibtillaah</i> (trials and tests) in the form of calamities that have expunged his sins, or similar things; then for that individual the recompense of Kibr – which originally was a barrier for him to enter Jannah – is eliminated and he gains admission (to it). Similarly Allaah, due to Divine Grace, may forgive the individual (the sin of) Kibr. [3] None shall gain admission (to Paradise) while possessing an atom’s weight of Kibr. As a result, those (scholars) discussing this Hadeeth, and other Hadeeth that have a similar theme, have stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Unconditional admission (to Paradise) – that is not in conjunction with punishment (for the sin of Kibr) – is what is being negated in this Hadeeth; not the admission to Jannah that is granted to those who have entered the Fire (to be purified and cleansed) and then are allowed admission to Paradise thereafter. (On the other hand) if a hadeeth explicitly declares that a particular person is in Jannah or that a particular person is from the People of Jannah, it would then be understood that he would enter the Jannah and not enter the fire (beforehand).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clarification we come to understand the true meaning of these narrations as being that the one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart is not from the people of Paradise (up to that point) and shall not gain admission into it without punishment (for his sin). Surely he deserves punishment – due to the enormity of the sin – similar to those who perform the Major (<i>Kabaa’ir</i>) sins. Allaah may punish him in the Fire as long as He wishes, but none from amongst the people of Tawheed shall remain in the Fire eternally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to be the way we understand all the Hadeeth that have a similar meaning. This understanding is to be used when seeking the meaning of his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b>“The one who severs the ties of the womb shall not enter Jannah”</b>[4] or <b>“You shall not enter Jannah until you believe. And you shall not believe until you love one another. Shall I inform you of something that if you do you shall (truly) love each other? Spread the greetings of Salaam amongst yourselves.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the understanding that we are to have when pondering over the ahaadeeth that contain threats of Punishment. In this way we understand that the hadeeth is general and can be attributed to both the unbelievers and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one was to say: “All the Muslims enter Jannah due to their Islaam.” The response is that not all Muslims enter Jannah without punishment. Surely the people who have been threatened (with punishment in the Hereafter due to their sins) shall enter into the Fire to remain in it for the period that Allaah so wills even though they are not unbelievers. The individual who has some Eemaan coinciding with major sins may enter into the Fire and exit from it as a result of the <i>Shafaa‘ah</i> (Intercession) of the Prophet or by other reported means as articulated by the Prophet when he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“My Shafaa‘ah is for the people who commit Majors Sins from amongst my Ummah.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said as is reported in the Saheeh: <b>“I shall bring out of the Fire the one who possesses half a mustard seed of Eemaan.”</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way we understand what is in store for those whom Allaah has threatened with punishment – the murderer, fornicator/adulterer, the one who consumes intoxicants, and the one who misappropriates the wealth of the orphans, the one who witnesses falsehood and others who perform the deeds of the people of major sins. They – even if they are not unbelievers – are not deserving of the Jannah that they are promised (as Muslims) without first being (cleansed and purged through) punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab (way and belief) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah is that the <i>Foosaaq</i> (deviant sinners) from amongst the general body of Muslims are not going to be eternally punished in the Fire as held by the Khawaarij[7] and the Mu‘tazilah.[8] They are not complete in their religion (Deen), Eemaan and obedience to Allaah.[9] They have good and bad deeds that necessitate a measure of punishment and reward. This is a concise dissertation regarding the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><br />
Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imaam Muslim, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ood. See <i>Islaah al-Masaajid</i>, checked by Shaykh Al-Albaanee <i>rahimahullaah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imam Muslim (54), Ibn Khuzaymah, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Sa‘d on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ood. At-Tabaraanee reports it on the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Salaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: Allaah the Most High says in Surah an-Nisaa’ (4:48): <b>“Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives what is besides that to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imaam Muslim (1765 – Abridged) al-Haakim, al-Bayhaqee, Abu Dawood, and at-Tirmidhee on the authority of Jubayr bin Mut‘aam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Note: Turn to the Chapter <b> “Shafaa‘ah for the People of Major Sins”</b> (Pg. 61-108) in the highly beneficial book of the world-renowned Muhaddith, Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi‘ee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) titled: “Ash-Shafaa‘ah.” In the chapter the Shaykh reports seventy-six (76) ahaadeeth showing that those who perform Major sins are not excluded from the <i>Shafaa‘ah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). This particular hadeeth can be found in the book on page 85, hadeeth number 56. Shaikh Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee reports that the Hadeeth is collected by at-Tirmidhee (v. 4, pg. 45) on the authority of Anas and Jaabir. He then states: “And this hadeeth is Hasan Saheeh Ghareeb (good and authentic yet scarce in this mode). The Hadeeth is reported by Ibn Khuzaymah (pg. 270), Ibn Hibbaan as is stated in the Mawrid (pg. 640), and al-Haakim (vol. 1, pg. 69) said: ‘This hadeeth is authentic and meets the requirements set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim even though they did not narrate it.’” Later on Shaykh Muqbil wrote: “Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (vol. 1, pg. 487) that its chain of narration is Saheeh and meets the requirements set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.” The Shaykh then takes us step by step through the chain of narration and proves convincingly that the hadeeth does not meet the requirements of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim due to the presence of Mu‘aamar reporting from Thaabit. For further detailed analysis turn to pg. 85-88. In Shaykh al-Albaani’s Saheeh al-Jaami‘, he declares the hadeeth Saheeh on the authority of Jaabir, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn ‘Umar, Ka‘b bin ‘Ajrah and Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Note: This is a segment of the famous Hadeeth of Shafaa‘ah collected by Al-Bukhaaree (vol. 13, pg. 472)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Translator’s Note: Khawaarij is the plural of Kharijee – They are those who declared that a Muslim becomes a disbeliever due to committing a major sin alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Translator’s Note: The Mu‘tazilah deem the one who does not agree with their understanding of Tawheed (7 false principles) is deemed a Mushrik. They believe that the sinners who are Muslim shall be in a place between Jannah and the Fire. Their beliefs are built on false logical deductions that led them to negate many of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. They were the deviant group who opposed the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal by falsely claiming that the Qur’aan is created and not the Speech of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator’s Note: The Murji’ah believe that sins, major or minor, do not affect faith and that Eemaan neither increases nor decreases. They claim that actions are not part of faith and that people do not vary in faith.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Nations were displayed before me; one or two prophets would pass by along with a few followers. A prophet would pass by accompanied by nobody. Then a big crowd of people passed in front of me and I asked, Who are they Are they my followers?&#8221; It was said, &#8216;No. It is Moses and his followers It was said to me, &#8216;Look at the horizon.&#8221; Behold! There was a multitude of people filling the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#8216;Look there and there about the stretching sky! Behold! There was a multitude filling the horizon,&#8217; It was said to me, &#8216;This is your nation out of whom seventy thousand shall enter Paradise without reckoning.&#8217; &#8220;Then the Prophet entered his house without telling his companions who they (the 70,000) were. So the people started talking about the issue and said, &#8220;It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&#8221; When the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Those people are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord &#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin said. &#8220;Am I one of them, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notes</strong> :<br />
1. Allaah says:<br />
&#8220;Some faces that Day shall be shining and radiant. Looking at their Lord&#8221;. (Soorah al-Qiyaamah 75:22-23) Shuaib reports that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Peace be upon him) said, &#8220;When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, will say &#8216;Do you wish for anything extra that I may give you?&#8217; They will say &#8216;Have You not brightened our faces? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire?&#8217; So He will remove the screen and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them as looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.&#8221; Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 1/114/no. 347) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hanbal said: I spoke to Abu &#8216;Abdullaah, meaning Ahmad (ibn Hanbal) about seeing Allaah (ar-Ru&#8217;yah). He said, &#8220;They are authentic ahaadeeth. We have Faith (Eemaan) in them and affirm it. We have Faith in and affirm everything reported from the Prophet (Peace be upon him) with good chains of narration.&#8221; Reported by al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in Sharh Usool I&#8217;tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah (no.889).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. &#8216;Adiyy ibn Haatim reports that the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, &#8220;There is not one of you except that Allaah will speak to him on the Day of Resurrection, there being no interpreter between Him and him.&#8221; Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 8/358/no.547), Ahmad and at-Tirmidhee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Merit of memorizing the Magnificent Names of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names; anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah (Paradise). Does this mean that anyone who memorizes the Names of Allah will enter Jannah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is one of the Hadiths that promise Jannah and speaks of virtues and good deeds. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Anyone who learns them will enter Jannah. According to another narration: Anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith urges us to consider carefully, ponder over, memorize and learn the Names of Allah, so that we can benefit from their great meanings, gain Khushu` (the heart being submissively attuned to the act of worship), obey Allah and fulfill our duty towards Him(Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who memorizes the Names of Allah, fulfills their duties towards Him, and shuns the major sins will be admitted to Jannah while those who commit major sins subject themselves to Allah&#8217;s Wrath and their fate is left to His Will: He may punish them or admit them to Jannah. Memorizing and learning the Names of Allah is one means to enter Jannah if a person does not commit major sins. Attaining Jannah has certain conditions that must be fulfilled and certain obstacles that must be avoided. Committing sins is one of the obstacles which prevent one from entering Jannah with those who will enter first. A Muslim who commits sins and does not repent before death will eventually enter Jannah after being punished and purified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah may forgive and admit them to Jannah without punishment. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The Fve (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided. Major sins include those prohibited acts for which a warning of severe punishment is given. These include all those which incur Allah&#8217;s Wrath, and are cursed by our Prophet (peace be upon him) such as Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), consuming Khamr (intoxicant), undutifulness to parents, involvement in Riba (usury/interest), Ghibah (backbiting), Namimah (tale-bearing), etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some major sins whose committers will be left to Allah&#8217;s Will: He may forgive and admit them to Jannah due to their belief in His Oneness and their Islam or punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and eventually bring them out of the Fire and into Jannah after purifying them of their sins. There are various Hadiths Mutawatir (Hadiths reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that indicate that many disobedient Muslimswill enter the Fire because of their sins and will be punished in a manner commensurate with these sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, the disobedient will be taken out of the Fire due to the Shafa`ah (intercession) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), angels, other prophets, and the children who died before they reached the age of puberty while others will be granted forgiveness due to Allah&#8217;s Mercy. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those disobedient Muslims are subject to Allah&#8217;s Will: He may forgive them and admit them to Jannah, or punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and then take them out of the Fire as they will not stay therein forever. None will abide eternally in the Fire except the Kafir (disbeliever) and Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) who will not be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, disobedient Muslims will not remain eternally in the Fire, according to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) unlike the Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief) and Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) who believe that the disobedient will stay eternally in the Fire. However, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah hold the view that the disobedient who have died as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah, but have not repented of their sins shall be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will. May Allah grant us all success!</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Will the one who memorize the Magnificent Names of Allah be admitted to Jannah (Paradise)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is reported in a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Anyone who learns them will enter Jannah. According to another narration: Anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah. These ninety-nine Names were not reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in any Hadith Sahih. However, the Muslim who is guided to learning them, by heart and put into action &#8211; and they are ninety-nine Names, is promised that goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above is one of the Hadiths which speak of the virtues of memorizing the ninety-nine Names of Allah, provided that one does not die while insisting on committing major sins because they are one of the causes that deprive a person from entering Jannah and cause him to be thrown into the Fire, unless one attains Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic principle is that unrestricted Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths should be interpreted in light of restricted ones, because neither the Ayah nor the Hadith contradicts each other. They rather confirm one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). Therefore, Allah indicates that avoiding major sins is a condition for expiating sins and entering Jannah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who memorize the ninety-nine Magnificent Names of Allah but commit Zina or consume Khamr are subject to Allah&#8217;s punishment and will be thrown into the Fire unless they repent and Allah forgives them.Contrary to the belief of Khawarij and Mu`tazilah, Muslims who believe in the Oneness of Allah will not abide eternally in the Fire for committing major sins. Those sinful people will be punished in a manner commensurate with their sins and then Allah will take them out of the Fire due to His Grace and Kindness. None will abide forever in the Fire except those whom the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith rule as Kafir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A disobedient person such as a fornicator, a thief, and those who are undutiful to their parents etc., will not abide eternally in the Fire. The disobedient, who did not repent of their sins before death, will not abide in the Fire forever. They are threatened to suffer the torment of the Fire. If Allah forgives them, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is the Source of Generosity and Benevolence; otherwise He will punish them to a degree commensurate with their sins and will eventually take them out of the Fire after being purified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us in many concurrent Hadiths that the disobedient will be taken out of the Fire and he (peace be upon him) will intercede several times for them as will the angels, the believers, and the children who died before reaching the age of puberty. This is the truth which Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah follow and which differs from the view of Khawarij and Mu`tazilah. The view of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is supported by Allah&#8217;s statement in His Noble Book: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states that if one commits sins, the matter is subject to His Will but He will not forgive whoever dies as a Mushrik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who dies as Mushrik will not be forgiven and will reside eternally in the Fire. A Mushrik is not considered to be one of Ahl-ul-Fatrah (people having no access to Divine Messages) or those who come under the same ruling as them, we seek refuge with Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies before repenting of their sins shall be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will; if He wills, He can pardon themout of His Grace, and if He wills He can punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and then take them out of the Fire by His immense Bounty and Mercy after they have been purified. Khawarij and Mu`tazilah hold a different view, as they believe that the disobedient will remain eternally in the Fire but according to the followers of the Truth, this is false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Your Eminence, it was reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one. Anyone who &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; will enter Jannah. Does the word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; mentioned in the Hadith mean memorizing or just reading them? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This Hadith was related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It was reported in two different wordings: first, &#8220;ahsaha&#8221; and second, anyone who memorizes them, will enter Jannah. The word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; means to memorize by heart and to act according to them. Thus, whoever learns the Names of Allah by heart and acts accordingly will be admitted to Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if one memorizes the Names of Allah by heart, but does not act or believe in them, they will be of no avail. The word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; means to memorize and act upon them. Therefore, it is Wajib upon whoever memorizes Allah&#8217;s Names to act accordingly. For example, a person should be &#8216;Rahim&#8217;, i.e. show mercy to others and should also believe that Allah is Al-`Aziz (the Ever-Mighty), Al-Hakim (the Most Wise), Al-Ra&#8217;uf (the Most Compassionate), Al-Rahim (the Most Beneficent), Al-Qadir (the All Powerful) Who has unlimited knowledge of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a person should fear Allah and remember that He is watching them and should not persist in committing sins of which HisLord knows. They should avoid sins and all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should exert all his efforts to memorize and act upon the Names of Allah, believe in Him and His Messenger, affirm the Names and the Attributes which Allah has affirmed for Himself in a manner befitting His majesty without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (negation of the meaning or function of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), or Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) and believe that Allah is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds, with no peer, equal or rival. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book: Say (O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One. &#8220;Allâh-us-Samad  [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]. &#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten. &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must believe that Allah is the Self-Sufficient, Who is similar to nothing and nothing is comparable to Him; Whom all creatures need, Who is Perfect in His Essence, Who neither begets nor was He begotten, and Whom none is co-equal or is similar to Him. Allah (Exalted be He) says: There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. And: Do you know of any who is similar to Him? And: So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing equal, comparable, or that can rival Allah (Exalted be He). He is Perfect in all things; His Knowledge, His Essence, His Wisdom, His Mercy, His Honor, His Power, and in all His Names which if one memorizes and acts accordingly, will allow them admission to Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the disobedient memorize and enumerate the Names of Allah, they will be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will; if He wills, He may forgive them, and if He wills He may punish them and eventually admit them to Jannah after they are taken out of the Fire and are purified provided that they have died as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major sins include all forms of Shirk, Kufr (disbelief), and the sins that were forbidden by Allah and their doers cursed, and warned of a severe punishment and Allah&#8217;s Wrath. The servant to Allah, male and female, must shun them for Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins i.e., the minor sins and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided. According to another narration: &#8230;so long as major sins are not committed. Major sins include Zina, theft, undutifulness to parents, severing the ties of kinship, consuming Riba, Ghibah, Namimah, fleeing during battle, and magic, in addition to other sins which Allah forbids.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, memorizing the Magnificent Names of Allah is one means of true happiness and being admitted into Jannah provided that one acts according to them, remains steadfast in obeying Allah and His Messenger, and does not persist in committing major sins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>alkhawf wa rrajaa</em> – fear and hope (of Allaah) – tape no. 1 <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Abu Huraira </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) said that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Whoever fears (Allaah) sets out at nightfall,[1] and whoever sets out at nightfall will reach the goal. Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive; indeed, the goods of Allaah is Paradise.”[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The meaning of this is that there is a price for entering Paradise and that entering it does not happen by feeling safe (from the plan of Allaah) and <em>at-tawaakul</em> (not taking any means and saying ‘Allaah will provide for me’), but rather it happens by (doing) righteous deeds and <em>at-tawakkul</em> (taking the means and putting one’s trust) in Allaah, the Blessed and Most High; as Allaah, the Might and Majestic, said: ‘And say (O Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>)) ‘Do deeds! Allaah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>].’’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in this <em>hadeeth</em>, there is an indication of the noble <em>aayah</em> that says: ‘<strong>This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world)</strong>,’[4] and in the other <em>aayah</em>: ‘<strong>Enter you Paradise because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)</strong>.’[5] And here, it occurs to many students who have some participation in studying the<em>Sunnah</em>, as they read or at least hear the statement of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) which is established in the <em>saheehayn</em>[6] that he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] said:  “‘<strong>None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds, but rather by the Favor of Allaah and His Mercy</strong>.’ They said, ‘Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Not even myself, unless Allaah encompasses me with His Favor and His Mercy.’”[7] So it seems that there is a contradiction between this <em>hadeeth</em> and the previous<em>aayah</em> along with our <em>hadeeth </em>in this book of ours where (the Prophet) <em>(‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive; indeed, the goods of Allaah is Paradise.’ Hence, there is a price (that one must pay) for Paradise and the two previous <em>aayaat</em> indicate that the price of Paradise is righteous deeds, and there is no doubt that good deeds do not benefit the one who does them at all except if he is truly a believer in Allaah and His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>]. So therefore, the price of Paradise is <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. Then how does one reconcile between these three texts – this reality that we learned from our <em>hadeeth</em> tonight, ‘Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive’ and from the two previous <em>aayaat</em> – and between this <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds, but rather by the Favor of Allaah and His Mercy’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reconciliation between (these two) is that… that which is negated in the last<em>hadeeth</em> ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds’ is one thing and that which is confirmed in the <em>aayah</em> ‘Enter you Paradise because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)’ is something else.<strong> That which is established in the <em>aayah</em> and the like is merely the entrance (into Paradise)</strong>, i.e., the key to Paradise, as mentioned in some narrations from <em>Wahb bin Munabbih</em> in <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>: ‘…the key to Paradise is <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah).’[8]<strong> So the key to Paradise is this <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. But, if this Muslim enters Paradise and he enjoys in it, </strong>as mentioned in some authentic narrations, that which ‘no eye has seen, no ear has heard and (that which) has not come to the mind of a human being,’[9] <strong>then this type of enjoyment is not by means of a price that this enjoyer presented, but rather (it is) by the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the price of merely entering (into Paradise) is<em> eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. As for, part of the specific nature of enjoyment in Paradise which we pointed to previously – there is in it what ‘no eye has seen, no ear has heard and (what) has not come to the mind of a human being’ – then there is no price for this; it is impossible for a price to be determined for it. Why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> from the <em>hadeeth</em> of <em>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:[10] ‘Indeed, I know the last man to come out from the Fire and the last man to enter Paradise. A man will come out of the Fire crawling.’ The meaning of this is that he comes out of the Fire being the most punished in it from the Muslims,and he comes out destroyed, exhausted (and) fatigued. Therefore, he is not able to walk straight as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, created him. But rather, he crawls until his life returns to him and his limbs are energetic and active. So he walks in this manner until Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, shows him a very great tree from far such that he is captivated by its beauty and splendor. And he wished for the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy after He saved him from the His severe punishment. Thus, he says: ‘O my Lord! Bring me to this tree so that I may be shaded by its shade, eat from its fruit[11] and drink from its water.’ Then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, while having more knowledge of His slave: ‘Would you ask me for other than it?’ (The man) says: ‘No O Lord, I will not ask you for other than it.’ So Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, brings him to that tree such that he is shaded by its shade, eats from its fruit and drinks from its water. Then, he continues on his way toward Paradise. Meanwhile, another tree appears to him which is more radiant, more beautiful and greater than the first one. So he hopes again and wishes more and more for the Favor of Allaah, so he asks Him and says: ‘O my Lord! Bring me to this tree’- and repeats the previous saying, then he is shaded by its shade and so on. Then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: ‘Would you ask me for other than it?’ (The man) says: ‘I will not ask you for other than it,’ while (Allaah) is more knowledgeable of him; our Lord knows that he will wish and wish until he enters Paradise. So He brings him to that tree such that he is shaded by its shade, eats from its fruit[12] and drinks from its water. Then, he continues on his way until he comes near the door of Paradise such that part of its refreshment, scent and joy come to him and he hears the voices of the people of Paradise. Thus, he says: ‘O my Lord! Let me enter Paradise,’ and maybe he says ‘Let me enter past the door of Paradise.’ So Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, says: ‘Enter Paradise, and there is for you the like of the world and ten times as much.’ So, the slave – almost not believing in the like of this divine favor when (Allaah) says to him ‘there is for you in Paradise the like of the world and ten times as much’ – says: ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord?’ And here, the narrator of the <em>hadeeth</em> laughed, who was <em>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood</em> as we mentioned. So he was asked by the one to whom he was narrating this <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘Why did you laugh?’ He said: ‘Because when the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) narrated the statement of the slave to His Lord ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord,’ he <em>(‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) had also laughed.’ They had asked the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) himself (about his reason for laughing), so he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] said: ‘Because Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, laughed at His slave when he said ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is clear from the <em>hadeeth</em> is that this person is the last to come out from the Fire and the last to enter Paradise, and he will have the like of the world and ten times as much. So does this destroyed person, who was the last to come out of the Fire, deserve this vast dominion in Paradise for his (good) deeds? No, this is by the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if we regard this detailed explanation, the contradiction disappears between this <em>hadeeth</em> and the two <em>aayaat</em>. And this is one of the many examples in which some contradiction appears to some people, even the sincere ones amongst them, between some texts, whether from the <em>Qur’aan </em>and <em>Sunnah </em>or from each of them individually. So, the Muslim must not be hasty and he must reflect on both texts, and if the way for reconciling between the two is not possible for him, he (should) ask the one who is above him, as our Lord, the Blessed and Most High, said: ‘So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know.’”[13]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir : 56. Al-Waqi&#8217;ah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(7. And you (all) will be in three groups. )</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(8. So those on the right &#8212; how (fortunate) will be those on the right!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(9. And those on the left &#8212; how (unfortunate) will be those on the left!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(10. And those foremost will be foremost.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And you (all) will be in three groups.) This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some will on the right of Allah&#8217;s Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam&#8217;s right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah&#8217;s Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam&#8217;s left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(So those on the right &#8212; how will be those on the right! And those on the left &#8212; how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.)</span> Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah&#8217;s leave, foremost in good deeds.)</span>(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And those foremost will be foremost.)</span> is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)</span>(3:133) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)</span>(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad from Anas, radi Allahu anhu, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were sitting in the presence of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam one day and he said, &#8216;A person is about to arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person from the Ansar arrived, his beard dripping with water from wudoo and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave us the salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then next day the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said words of similar import and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam again said words of similar import and again this person appeared in the same condition, so when Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam left, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-Aas followed this person and said, &#8216;Indeed I have abused my father and I swear that I would not go to him for three days so if you would let me stay with you until those three days expire, I would do so.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas continued saying, &#8220;So &#8216;Abdullah told us that he spent three nights with this person yet he did not see him stand for the night prayer at all. All he did was <strong>when he turned sides on his bed he would mention Allah and make takbeer and would do this until he stood for fajr prayer</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;<strong>Except that I never hear him speak except good</strong>&#8216;. So when the three days were over I was eager to make little of his actions. I said, &#8216;O servant of Allah there was no hatred or disassociation between my father and me but I heard Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam saying on three occasions, &#8220;A person is about to arrive who is from the people of Paradise,&#8221; and you arrived on those three occasions, so I wished to stay with you so that I may look at your actions and emulate them. But I have not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so what is it that has reached you to make Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam say what he said?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;It is nothing more than what you have seen, except that <strong>I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;This is that which has reached you and is something that we cannot endure.'&#8221;</p>
