<p><span style="color: #993300">The following has been taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir (Darussalam English Publication) :</span></p>



<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah said to Ubayy bin Ka`b,</p>



<p>(Verily, Allah has commanded me to recite to you (<span style="color: #003300"><strong>Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture</strong></span>.)) Ubayy said, &#8220;He (Allah) mentioned me by name to you&#8221; The Prophet replied,</p>



<p>(Yes.) So he (Ubayy) cried. Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa&#8217;i all recorded this Hadith from Shu`bah.</p>



<p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">لَمْ يَكُنِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَالْمُشْرِكِينَ مُنفَكِّينَ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</span></strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">رَسُولٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ يَتْلُو صُحُفًا مُّطَهَّرَةً</span></strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">فِيهَا كُتُبٌ قَيِّمَةٌ</span></strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</span></strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ حُنَفَاءَ وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ الْقَيِّمَةِ</span></strong></h2>



<p><span style="color: #003300"><strong>(1. Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and the idolators, were not going to leave until there came to them the Bayyinah.) (2. A Messenger from Allah reciting purified pages.) (3. Wherein are upright Books.) (4. And the People of the Scripture differed not until after there came to them the Bayyinah.) (5. And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, making religion purely for Him alone, Hunafa&#8217;, and that they perform Salah and give Zakah, and that is the right religion.)</strong></span></p>



<p>As for the People of the Scripture, they are the Jews and the Christians, and the idolators are the worshippers of idols and fire among the Arabs and the non-Arabs. Mujahid said, they are not going</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(to leave)</span></strong> &#8220;Meaning, they will not be finished until the truth becomes clear to them.&#8221; Qatadah also said the same thing.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(until there came to them the Bayyinah.)</span> </strong>meaning, this Qur&#8217;an. This is why Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and idolators, were not going to leave until there came to them the Bayyinah.)</span></strong> Then He explains what the Bayyinah is by His saying,</p>



<p><span style="color: #003300"><strong>(A Messenger from Allah, reciting purified pages.)</strong></span> meaning, Muhammad and the Magnificent Qur&#8217;an he recites, which is written down among the most high gathering in purified pages. This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>



<p>(<span style="color: #008000">In Records held in honor. Exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels). Honorable and obedient.</span>) (80:13-16) Then Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(Wherein are upright Books.)</span></strong> Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;Meaning in the purified pages are Books from Allah that are upright, just and straight. They have no mistakes in them because they are from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.&#8221;</p>



<p>Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(And the People of the Scripture differed not until after there came to them the Bayyinah.)</span> </strong>This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>



<p>(<span style="color: #008000">And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the Bayyinat came to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment</span>.) (3:105) This refers to the people of those divinely revealed Scriptures that were sent down to the nations that were before us. After Allah established the proofs and evidences against them, they divided and differed concerning that which Allah had intended in their Scriptures, and they had many differences. This is like what has been reported in a Hadith that has many routes of transmission,</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000">(Verily, the Jews differed until they became seventy-one sects. And verily, the Christians differed until they became seventy-two sects. And this Ummah will divide into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in the Fire except one.)</span> They said, &#8220;Who are they, O Messenger of Allah&#8221; He replied,</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000">((Those who are upon) what I and my Companions are upon.)</span></p>



<p>Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, making religion purely for Him alone,)</span> </strong>This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>



<p>(<span style="color: #008000">And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him: La ilaha illa Ana</span>.) (21:25) Thus, Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(Hunafa&#8217;)</span> </strong>meaning, avoiding Shirk and being truly devout to Tawhid. This is like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>



<p>(<span style="color: #008000">And Verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allah, and avoid the Taghut (false deities).</span>&#8221;) (16:36) A discussion of the word Hanif has already been mentioned previously and in Surat Al-An`am, so there is no need to repeat it here.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(and perform Salah)</span> </strong>And this is the best of the physical forms of worship.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(and give Zakah,)</span></strong> This is doing good to the poor and the needy.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(and that is the right religion.)</span></strong> meaning, the upright and just religion, or the nation that is straight and balanced.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>إِ<span style="color: #000000">نَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَالْمُشْرِكِينَ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ شَرُّ الْبَرِيَّةِ</span></strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ</span></strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span style="color: #000000">جَزَاؤُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۖ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ رَبَّهُ&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(6. Verily, those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and idolators, will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.) (7. Verily, those who believe and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures.) (8. Their reward with their Lord is Eternal Gardens, underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever, Allah will be pleased with them, and they well-pleased with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.)</span></strong></p>



<p>Allah informs of what will happen to the wicked disbelievers among the People of the Scripture and the idolators who oppose the Allah&#8217;s divinely revealed Books and the Prophets whom He sent. He says that they will be in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement and they will abide therein forever. This means that they will remain in it and they will have no way out of it and they will not cease being in it.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(They are the worst of creatures.)</span></strong> meaning, they are the worst creation that Allah has fashioned and created. Then Allah informs about the situation of the righteous people who believed in their hearts and performed righteous deeds with their bodies. He says that they are the best of creation. Abu Hurayrah and a group of the scholars have used this Ayah as a proof that the believers have a status among the creatures that is better than the angels. This is because Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(They are the best of creatures.)</span> </strong>Then Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(Their reward with their Lord)</span> </strong>meaning, on the Day of Judgement.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(is Eternal Gardens underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever,)</span> </strong>meaning, having no end, no break and no conclusion.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(Allah will be pleased with them, and they well-pleased with Him.)</span></strong> The condition of Him being pleased with them is more illustrious than all of the everlasting delights that they will be given.</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(and they well-pleased with Him.)</span></strong> Due to the comprehensive favors He has given them. Then Allah says,</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #003300">(That is for him who fears his Lord.)</span></strong> meaning, this is the reward that will be attained by those who revere Allah and fear Him as He deserves to be feared. This is the person who worships Allah as if he sees Him, and he knows that even though he does not see Him, indeed Allah sees him.</p>



<p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000">(Shall I not inform you of the best of creation)</span> They said, &#8220;Of course, O Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He said,</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000">(A man who takes the reins of his horse in the way of Allah, and whenever there is a fearful cry from the enemy, he climbs upon it. Shall I not inform you of the best of creation)</span> They said, &#8220;Of course, O Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He said,</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000">(A man who has a flock of sheep and he establishes the prayer and gives the obligatory charity. Shall I not inform you of the worst of creation)</span> They said, &#8220;Of course.&#8221; He said,</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000">(The person who is asked by Allah and he does not give by Him.)</span></p>



<p>This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Lam Yakun (Al-Bayyinah), and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation of Verse 5 of Sooratul Faatiha</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ihdinā aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;the path&#8221; (aṣ-Ṣirāṭ):</strong></span> Regarding this word, there are two permissible recitations, one with the Arabic letter س (sīn) as in السِّرَاط and another with the letter ص (ṣād) as it is here in the verse: الصِّرَاط . The meaning of <em>aṣ-Ṣirāṭ</em> is the way or path. The meaning of &#8220;<strong>Guide us&#8221;</strong> refers to the guidance of showing and directing to the right path as well as the guidance of granting success. So, by reciting, <strong>&#8220;Guide us to the straight path&#8221;</strong>, you are asking Allah for <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> (which is the guidance of direction) and <strong>righteous action</strong> (which is the guidance of success in following the knowledge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;straight&#8221; (al-Mustaqīm):</strong></span> This means the correct path with no crookedness or deviation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 5:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from this verse is the concept of mankind’s resorting back to Allah. After requesting Allah’s help in fulfilling his worship in the previous verse, mankind now asks Allah to guide them to the straight path. There must be sincerity solely to Allah in worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8221; and help must be sought in fulfilling and strengthening this worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Also, one must follow the Islamic legislation and this is indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; because the straight path is none other than the complete legislation with which the messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has come with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point from this verse is that the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an is shown in that there is no preposition after <strong>&#8220;Guide us&#8221;</strong> in the Arabic text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[TN: The author here refers to the original Arabic text. The verse would literally be translated as “Guide us the straight path” without the added English preposition “to.”]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is made so that the verse would contain both types of seeking guidance: the guidance of knowledge and direction, and the guidance of success and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This first type</strong></span> is only the directing to and showing the straight path, and Allah guides all of mankind with this meaning of guidance as in his statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The month of Ramadan in which the Qur&#8217;an was revealed (as) guidance for mankind</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second type of guidance</span></strong> is the granting of success along with the first type of guidance and the following of the Islamic legislation as Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is the book, wherein there is no doubt, a means of guidance for the <em>Muttaqīn</em> (those who are constantly and fearfully conscious of Allah)</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second type of guidance may not be achieved by some people as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And as for (the people of) Thamūd, we guided them (i.e. showed them the right way), but they preferred blindness over guidance.</span> [Sūrah al-Fuṣṣilat, 41:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here,<strong> &#8220;we guided them&#8221;</strong> means: We made clear to them the truth and directed them to follow it but they chose not to accept the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another benefit we get from this verse is that the “path” is of two types: one straight and all others crooked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever is in accordance with the truth, it is the straight path as Allah tells the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) to say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ هَذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight path so follow it and do not follow (other) paths for they will separate you away from his (Allah’s) path</span>. [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anything that opposes the truth is a crooked path.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation of Verses 6 &amp; 7  of Sooratul Faatiha</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those you bestowed grace upon</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The path of those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna An’amta ‘alayhim)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is connected to the previous verse and provides further clarification of &#8220;the straight path&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the same ones mentioned in the statement of Allah in another part of the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ  وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَئِكَ رَفِيقًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever obeys Allah and the messenger, then they will be with those Allah bestowed grace upon of the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. And what excellent companions they are!</span> [Sūrah an-Nisā, 4:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Not of those who earned anger upon themselves&#8221; (ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim): </strong>Such as the followers of Judaism and anyone else who knows the truth yet refuses to act according to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;nor of those who are astray&#8221; (wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn): </strong>Such as the Christians before the mission of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) began. It also refers to anyone who works contrary to the truth, choosing to remain ignorant of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the word &#8220;upon them&#8221; (‘alayhim), it has two acceptable recitations from the seven forms: one is with a (ḍammah) on the letter هُ (hā) making the reading عَلَيْهُم (‘alayhum) and the other reading is the common one with a (kasrah) on the هِ (hā) which is read as عَلَيْهِم (‘alayhim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to know that any different form of recitation that is not within the copies of the Qur&#8217;an that most people have, this different recitation, even though it is permissible, should not be read among common people who may not be aware of the different ways of reciting. This is due to three reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Even the common people, although unaware of the different forms of recitation, consider this Qur&#8217;an to be something amazing and honorable. Their hearts are filled with its greatness and respect for it. If they began to hear it read sometimes one way and then other times a different way, then this may result in the Qur&#8217;an being lower with them from the high status it was once given. This is only because they are not aware of the various recitations and therefore cannot distinguish between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If someone recites with the different forms of recitation, he may be accused of making mistakes and not knowing how to recite. This is because he recites in a way that is unknown to most people. So, this reader, even though may be correct, is then spoken about in a negative way amongst the majority of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Even if a common person gives someone reciting in a different way the benefit of the doubt and believes that he knows what he recites, then such a person may begin to blindly follow the one reciting in the various ways of reading. So, perhaps he, the common person, may then mistakenly recite a way different from any of the permissible ways believing it to be one of the seven allowable recitations of the Qur&#8217;an. This would then be a form of distortion and corruption. For this reason, ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه), one of the prophet’s companions, said, “<strong>Speak to people according to what they know, (otherwise) would you like that they (unknowingly) deny what Allah and his messenger say (because you confuse them)?”</strong> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī as notes to another ḥadīth (no. 127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه ), another companion of Prophet Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), said, “<strong>You will never speak to any people with something that they cannot comprehend except that it will become a Fitnah (negative trial or tribulation) for some of them</strong>.” [Recorded by Muslim (no. 14)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whenever ‘Umar Ibn al-Khaṭṭāb heard Hishām Ibn Ḥakīm recite a verse that he had never heard recited in that way before, he (‘Umar) dragged him to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and informed him of this. The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Hishām:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اِقْرَأ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Recite</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) told ‘Umar to recite and afterwards again said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was (also) revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 4992) and Muslim (no. 818)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an was revealed in seven different dialects and the people used to recite in all of them until ‘Uthmān gathered the people together upon one common recitation because they were beginning to differ and dispute over each other’s recitations. He feared that the differences would become severe, dividing the people. So, he gathered them all together upon one recitation which was the dialect of the Quraysh tribe because the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), upon whom the Qur&#8217;an was revealed, was sent from and among them. The other forms of recitation were somewhat forgotten by most people. So, if ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) did what he did to another companion, then what about an ordinary person who hears you recite in a way different from the familiar copy of the Qur&#8217;an he has?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thanks to Allah, the scholars have always been in agreement that it is not compulsory for people to recite in all the different permissible ways. If a person remains reciting upon one particular recitation, there is no problem with this. So, avoid problems and what could lead to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verses 6 and 7:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from these two verses is the mentioning of specific descriptive details after a general description. This is from the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; – this is a general description and &#8220;<strong>The path of those you bestowed grace upon</strong>&#8221; is a more specific and detailed description of the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefit in mentioning something general and then afterwards more relevant details is that when a person hears of something general that could benefit him, he might eagerly anticipate more details and a clearer explanation. Then, after becoming aware of the detailed descriptions, he is ready to accept them and anxiously hopes to obtain what is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another benefit is the explanation that the people upon whom Allah has bestowed his favors and grace, they are the same ones who are upon the straight path as a result of this grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point we learn from this verse is that the blessing of guidance, with which some people have been favored, is directly from Allah alone; it is a pure favor from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. From the verse, we understand that all of mankind is of either one of three categories: those upon whom Allah has bestowed his grace, those who have earned anger upon themselves, or those who are astray. Each of these categories has already been explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ways leading away from the straight path are either <strong>ignorance</strong> or <strong>arrogant disobedience</strong>.The ones who were taken away from the straight path due to arrogance and disobedience, they are those who earned anger upon themselves and the head of this group are the followers of Judaism. The other group, those who have deviated from the straight path due to ignorance, they are any people who do not know the truth, the main ones among these being the Christians. However, this was their (the Christian’s) situation before the advent of the last prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Now that the prophet’s mission has been established and completed, they have known the truth but in spite of that, opposed it. So, they and the Jews both have become the same – all of them are those who have earned anger upon themselves (if they do not repent and accept Allah’s religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. These last two verses also illustrate the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an in that the expression used to refer to those who have earned anger upon themselves, مَغْضُوْب (Maghḍūb), is in the Arabic form (according to Arabic morphology) known as the مَفْعُوْل (maf’ūl) – an Arabic conjugal form that indicates that the anger upon them has already begun and is continuously occurring from Allah and from his close allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another point we learn from these verses is that the severest type of misguided group is placed first, then the next in severity. Allah mentioned those who earned anger upon themselves before those who are astray because the first are more severe in opposition to the truth than the ones astray and misguided. Opposing something while being fully aware of it is much harder to return from than opposing something simply because of being ignorant of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 1 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;">al-Ḥamdu lillāhi Rabbil-‘Ālamīn</span>)<br />
<strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah, the lord of all creations.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; (al-Ḥamd):</strong></span> This word الْحَمْدُ (<strong>al-Ḥamd</strong>) is used only to describe someone, out of love and honor, with complete perfection of self, attributes, and actions. So, Allah is perfect in his self, his attributes, and his actions. This praising, however, must be with a condition, it must be made with love and honor. The people of knowledge say that simply describing someone with perfection yet not out of real love and honor for the praised one is not called حَمْدُ (Ḥamd). Rather, in that case it would only be called مَدْح (<strong>Madḥ</strong>) (a lesser degree of praise or admiration). Therefore, this (second) type of praising occurs often from people while they may not really love the one they are praising. Often, they only want to gain something from them. For example, some poets stand before their government leaders and recite poetry of amazing praiseworthy descriptions of them yet void of any real love for them. The poets’ love is for the wealth they are given or they do this out of fear of the leaders. On the contrary, our praise for our lord is a form of praise out of love and honor.<strong> So, &#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; is to praise the one described with total perfection out of love and honor for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ال (al-) in الْحَمْدُ (al-Ḥamd) is inclusive, meaning that it includes all forms of praise and thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;are for Allah&#8221; (lillāhi):</span> </strong>The لِ (li) is to show possession and a sense of deserving. The name “Allah” is the proper name of our lord ( عزّ وجلّ ) and no one else is given this name; it means the one god that is worshipped out of love and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;the lord&#8221; (Rabb):</span></strong> The word “lord” here includes three main descriptions: the creator, the owner, and the controller of all affairs. So, he is the creator of all that exists, the owner of all that exists, and the controller of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;of all creations&#8221; (al-‘Ālamīn):</span> </strong>As for the word “‘Ālamīn”, the scholars say it refers to anything and everything other than Allah. Everything else besides Allah is described with this word because the very existence of everything is a sign or indication (in Arabic: Ālam) that they have a creator (سبحانه وتعالى) In every form of creation there is a sign indicating the existence of its creator, his capability, wisdom, mercy, power, and the rest of his attributes of lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 1:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. One of the beneficial points we gain from this verse is the affirmation of praise of perfection to Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). This is shown by the “al-” in the word “al-Ḥamd” because this definite article in Arabic grammar is inclusive to include all forms or praise and gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It also shows that Allah alone deserves all forms of praise and gratitude. For this reason, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to say whenever something happened he was happy with:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ تُتِمُّ الصَّالِحَات</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah by whose favor righteous deeds are fulfilled.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would say when if something did not please him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah in all situations</strong>.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another point of benefit from the verse is the description of Allah with his sole right to worship first before describing him with his lordship. This is either indicated because the name “Allah” is his proper name, specific to him and the source of all the rest of His names; or it is due to the fact that the people the messengers were sent to used to only deny Allah’s sole right to worship. Most of the people did not deny Allah’s lordship (that he is the creator, owner, and controller of everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. This verse also proves Allah’s complete lordship over all of the creations due to his statement: &#8220;<strong>The lord of all creation</strong>s.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>] Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 3803) and al-Ḥākim in his “Mustadrak” (1/449) and he said, “This ḥadīth has an authentic chain of narrators.” adh-Dhahabī agreed with him. The famous ḥadīth scholar, al-Albānī, said it is “ḥasan” in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3066).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Is the Basmalah (بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ) an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah or Not?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars hold differing opinions about this issue. Some say that it is definitely a verse from al-Fātiḥah and it should be recited aloud in those prayers which are recited out-loud. They believe it is not correct unless the Basmalah is recited since it is part of the entire chapter of al-Fātiḥah. Other scholars say that it is not a verse of al-Fātiḥah, but it is a separate verse from the book of Allah. This latter opinion is the correct one and is proven by other texts as well as the context of the chapter itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual proof, Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه ) narrated a ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant.” When the servant recites, &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah, the lord of all creations&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has praised me.” And when he recites, &#8220;The Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has honored me.” When he recites, &#8220;The owner of the Day of Recompense&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has glorified me.” When he recites, &#8220;You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help&#8221;, Allah replies, “This is two parts between my servant and I.” When he recites, &#8220;Guide us to the straight path…&#8221; until the end of the chapter, Allah replies, “This is for My servant and he will have what he asks for.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 395)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a textual proof that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah (because it was not the first statement the servant says as mentioned in this ḥadīth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic statement of Anas ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim” in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>I prayed behind the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), Abū Bakr, and ‘Umar and none of them used to mention “In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy” at the beginning of their recitations (of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah) nor at the end of it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 399)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is that each of them used not to mention it aloud. The fact that there is a distinction between it not being recited aloud as the rest of al-Fātiḥah is recited indicates that it is not actually a part of the chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the other verses’ meanings, Sūrah al-Fātiḥah consists of seven verses as is unanimously agreed upon. If you wanted to measure out seven verses as they pertain to the topics of the chapter, you will find that the middle verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the same verse about which Allah says, “This is two parts between my servant and I” in the previous ḥadīth. This is because the first verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">All praise and thanks are for Allah, the Lord of all creations</span>. [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The owner of the Day of Recompense.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three previous verses are all about the rights of Allah (his attribute, actions, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span>[Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth verse and the half-way point and it too is even divided into two parts, one part for Allah (“You alone we worship…”) and one part for the servant (“…from you alone we seek help.”).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following verses are:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those upon whom You bestowed Your grace.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And finally, this last verse is also for the servant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, three verses are for Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) and they are the first three. And three verses are for the servant and they are the last three. One verse is between both the servant and his lord and it is the fourth and middle verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the wordings, if we say that the <em>Basmalah</em> is a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, then the seventh verse would be very long – as long as two of the other verses (thus making the last and incomparably long verse, “The path of those upon whom you bestowed your grace, not of those who earned anger, nor of those who are astray.”). But it is known that the principle of the verses being similar to each other is also regarding their length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">So, the correct opinion no doubt is that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah just as it is not a verse (at the beginning) of every other chapter in the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 4 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">iyyāka na’budu wa iyyāka nasta’īn</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You alone&#8221; (iyyāka)</strong>: This is a case in grammar when the direct object comes before the verb, <strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>. In Arabic grammar, when the direct object precedes the verb, it gives a sense of restriction, so the meaning would be, “<strong>We do not worship anyone or anything except you alone</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>: Meaning: We humble ourselves to you in complete humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, you find the believers placing the most honorable part of their bodies (their faces) at the level of their feet in humility to Allah (عزّ وجلّ). They prostrate on the ground, covering their foreheads with dirt. This is from their humbleness before Allah. And if another person were to say, “I will give you the whole world and what it contains, just prostrate to me once,” you will never find true believers accepting this because this type of humility is a form of worship specifically for Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “<strong>worship</strong>” includes doing everything Allah commands and avoiding everything he forbids. Whoever is not in accordance with this, not carrying out what he is commanded to do and avoiding what he is forbidden to do then he is not a true worshipper and servant. A worshipper is someone who obeys the one he worships in whatever he legislates. So, worship requires that mankind carry out everything they are commanded to do and avoid everything they are forbidden from doing. However, it is not possible to fulfill all of these duties without the help and assistance of Allah. Because of this, Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;and from you alone we seek help&#8221; (wa iyyāka nasta’īn)</strong>: Meaning, “We do not seek the help of anyone else in worship or in anything else.” This “seeking of help” is to request the help and assistance, and Allah combines between worship and the seeking of assistance or reliance in many places the noble Qur&#8217;an. This is because worship could not be completely established except with the help of Allah by entrusting one’s affairs to him, and relying on him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 4:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the virtues of this verse is the sincerity in worship that is due to Allah alone as he says, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8220;. It shows that this worship is due only to Allah by the direct object (“<strong>You</strong>”) coming before the verb (“<strong>we worship</strong>”) according to the rules of Arabic grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point is that seeking help is also sincerely and solely for Allah based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Likewise, the direct object precedes the verb indicating a sense of restriction just like in the first part of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those points being said, what if someone asks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">How is it that seeking help is exclusively for Allah alone when there has come in another verse:</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety</span>.[Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, how do we understand the previous statements about seeking help only from Allah when, here in this verse, Allah confirms that seeking help from other than himself is permissible (rather it is a command here)? Also, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> تُعِيْنُ الرَّجُلَ فِي دَابَّتِهِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُ عَلَيْهَا، أَوْ تَرْفَعُ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا مَتَاعَهُ صَدَقَةٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Helping someone onto his riding animal, carrying him on it, or lifting his belongings up to him while he is on it &#8211; all of these are (considered) acts of charity</span>. [Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2891) and Muslim (no. 1009)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this question is that the act of seeking help and assistance is of two types. The first type is to request help while entrusting all affairs to the one you ask from. For example, you rely completely on Allah and you realize that any result you seek will not come from your own power or capability. This type of seeking help is specific for Allah ( تعالى ); he alone deserves this type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type is to request help or cooperation in something you want to accomplish. This type is permissible as long as the one being requested is living and capable of doing what is asked of him. This is not considered a form of worship. This is the type that Allah refers to when saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety.</span> [Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is further asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Is seeking help from the creation permissible at all times and in all situations?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is no. Requesting help from the creation is only allowed when the one being asked is fully capable of what he is being asked for, otherwise seeking his help is not permissible. An example would be asking help from someone dead in his grave; this is prohibited, rather it is major Shirk (the associating of partners with Allah in worship)! This is because the person in his grave does not even have the ability to help himself, so how could he help someone else? Similarly, if someone seeks the help of another person who is not present with him such as a person believing that someone else in the far eastern part of the world could help him with something in his (the one seeking help) land – this is also major Shirk because the person whose help is sought is not capable of helping the seeker while they are in different lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is now asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So, is it permissible to seek help from the creation if these conditions are met?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that it is better not to ask anyone for any help unless it is absolutely necessary or if it is known that the person would be happy to provide help. In this case, one could request his assistance in order to please him. The act that you seek another’s help in fulfilling must also not be something sinful and prohibited.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>And when the graves are turned upside down (and they bring out their contents)</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>عَلِمَتْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ وَأَخَّرَتْ</strong></span></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>(Then) a person will know what he has sent forward and (what he has) left behind (of good or bad deeds).</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>(It will be) the Day when no person shall have power (to do) anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be (wholly) with Allah.</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The below Explanation was taken from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Darusssalam English Publication</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qari`ah is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, like Al-Haqqah, At-Tammah, As-Sakhkhah, Al-Ghashiyah and other names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah intensifies concern and fright for it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what will make you know what Al-Qari`ah is</strong></span>) Then He explains this by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is a Day whereon mankind will be like moths scattered about.</strong></span>) meaning, in their scattering, their dividing, their coming and their going, all due to being bewildered at what is happening to them, they will be like scattered moths. This is like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As if they were locusts spread abroad</strong></span>.) (54:7) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the mountains will be like wool, carded</strong></span>.) meaning, they will become like carded wool that has began to wear out (fade away) and be torn apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi have all said, <strong>(like wool (`Ihn). ) &#8220;Woolen.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah informs about the results received by those who performed the deeds, and the honor and disgrace they will experience based upon their deeds. He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then as for him whose Balance will be heavy</strong></span>.) meaning, his good deeds are more than his bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will live a pleasant life</strong></span>.) meaning, in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#000000;">But as for him whose Balance will be light.</span></strong>) meaning, his bad deeds are more than his good deeds. Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His mother will be Hawiyah</strong></span>.) It has been said that this means he will be falling and tumbling headfirst into the fire of Hell, and the expression `<strong>his mothe</strong>r&#8217; has been used to refer to his <strong>brain</strong> (as it is the mother of his head). A statement similar to this has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih and Qatadah. Qatadah said, &#8220;<strong>He will fall into the Hellfire on his head</strong>.&#8221; Abu Salih made a similar statement when he said, &#8220;They will fall into the Fire on their heads.&#8221; It has also been said that it means his mother that he will return to and end up with in the Hereafter will be Hawiyah, which is one of the names of the Hellfire. Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;Al-Hawiyah is only called his mother because he will have no other abode except for it.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;Al-Hawiyah is the Fire, and it will be his mother and his abode to which he will return, and where he will be settled.&#8221; Then he recited the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Their abode will be the Fire.</strong></span>) (3:151) Ibn Abi Hatim said that it has been narrated from Qatadah that he said, &#8220;It is the Fire, and it is their abode.&#8221; Thus, Allah says in explaining the meaning of Al-Hawiyah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what will make you know what it is</strong></span>). Allah&#8217;s statement</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#000000;">A fire Hamiyah!</span></strong>) meaning, extreme heat. It is a heat that is accompanied by a strong flame and fire. It is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The fire of the Children of Adam that you all kindle is one part of the seventy parts of the fire of Hell</strong>.) They (the Companions) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Isn&#8217;t it sufficient&#8221; He replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>It is more than it by sixty-nine times</strong>.) This has been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. In some of the wordings he stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is more than it by sixty-nine times, each of them is like the heat of it</strong>.) It has been narrated in a Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Verily, the person who will receive the lightest torment of the people of the Hellfire will be a man who will have two sandals that will cause his brain to boil.</strong> )&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The Hellfire complained to its Lord and said, &#8220;O Lord! Some parts of me devour other parts of me.&#8221; So He (Allah) permitted it to take two breaths: one breath in the winter and one breath in the summer. Thus, the most severe cold that you experience in the winter is from its cold, and the most severe heat that you experience in the summer is from its heat.</strong> )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>When the heat becomes intense pray the prayer when it cools down, for indeed the intense heat is from the breath of Hell</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qari`ah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَاتَّخِذُوا مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ۖ وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</strong></span></h2>

<hr />
<p><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Virtue of Allah&#8217;s House</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">125. And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (or the stone on which Ibrahim as a place)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They do not remain in the House, they only visit it and return to their homes, and then visit it again.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Abu Jafar Ar-Razi narrated from Ar-Rabi bin Anas from Abu Al-Aliyah who said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Safe from enemies and armed conflict. During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people were often victims of raids and kidnapping, while the people in the area surrounding it (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) were safe and not subject to kidnapping.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Mujahid, Ata&#8217;, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas were reported to have said that the Ayah (2:125) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever enters it shall be safe.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that Allah honored the Sacred House, which Allah made as a safe refuge and safe haven. Therefore, the souls are eager, but never bored, to conduct short visits to the House, even every year. This is because Allah accepted the supplication of His Khalil, Ibrahim, when he asked Allah to make the hearts of people eager to visit the House. Ibrahim said (14:40),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ</strong><br />
(Our Lord! And accept my invocation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah described the House as a safe resort and refuge, for those who visit it are safe, even if they had committed acts of evil. This honor comes from the honor of the person who built it first, Khalil Ar-Rahman, just as Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لإِبْرَهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْئاً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim the site of the (Sacred) House (the Kabah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me&#8230;&#8221;) (22:26) and,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-Alamin (mankind and Jinn). In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:96-97).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last honorable Ayah emphasized the honor of Ibrahim&#8217;s Maqam, and the instruction to pray next to it,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer). The Maqam of Ibrahim Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Said bin Jubayr commented on the Ayah,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer) &#8220;The stone (Maqam) is the standing place of Ibrahim, Allah&#8217;s Prophet, and a mercy from Allah. Ibrahim stood on the stone, while Ismail was handing him the stones (constructing the Kabah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Maqam of Ibrahim is a stone which Ismail&#8217;s wife put under Ibrahim&#8217;s feet when washing his head.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi mentioned this, but he considered it unauthentic, although others gave it prefrence, Ar-Razi reported it in his Tafsir from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi bin Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Jabir, describing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet said, &#8220;When the Prophet performed Tawaf, Umar asked him, Is this the Maqam of our father&#8217; He said, Yes.&#8217; Umar said, Should we take it a place of prayer&#8217; So Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Chapter: Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer) meaning, they return to it repeatedly.&#8221; He then narrated that Anas bin Malik said that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;I agreed with my Lord, or my Lord agreed with me, regarding three matters. I said, O Messenger of Allah! I wish you take the Maqam of Ibrahim a place for prayer.&#8217; The Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham)) was revealed. I also said, O Messenger of Allah! The righteous and the wicked enter your house. I wish you would command the Mothers of the believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) to wear Hijab. Allah sent down the Ayah that required the Hijab. And when I knew that the Prophet was angry with some of his wives, I came to them and said, Either you stop what you are doing, or Allah will endow His Messenger with better women than you are.&#8217; I advised one of his wives and she said to me, O Umar! Does the Messenger of Allah not know how to advise his wives, so that you have to do the job instead of him&#8217; Allah then revealed,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَـتٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;">It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you, ـ Muslims (who submit to Allah)</span>).&#8221; (66:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Jabir said, &#8220;After the Messenger of Allah kissed the Black Stone, he went around the house three times in a fast pace and four times in a slow pace. He then went to Maqam of Ibrahim, with it between him and the House, and prayed two Rakahs.&#8221; This is part of the long Hadith that Muslim recorded in Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that Amr bin Dinar said that he heard Ibn Umar say, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf around the House seven times and then prayed two Rakahs behind the Maqam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these texts indicate that the Maqam is the stone that Ibrahim was standing on while building the House. As the House&#8217;s walls became higher, Ismail brought his father a stone, so that he could stand on it, while Ismail handed him the stones. Ibrahim would place the stones on the wall, and whenever he finished one side, he would move to the next side, to complete the building all around. Ibrahim kept repeating this until he finished building the House, as we will describe when we explain the story of Ibrahim and Ismail and how they built the House, as narrated from Ibn Abbas and collected by Al-Bukhari. Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints were still visible in the stone, and the Arabs knew this fact during the time of Jahiliyyah. This is why Abu Talib said in his poem known as Al-Lamiyyah&#8217;, &#8220;And Ibrahim&#8217;s footprint with his bare feet on the stone is still visible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims also saw Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints on the stone, as Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;I saw the Maqam with the print of Ibrahim&#8217;s toes and feet still visible in it, but the footprints dissipated because of the people rubbing the stone with their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier, the Maqam was placed close to the Kabah&#8217;s wall. In the present time, the Maqam is placed next to Al-Hijr on the right side of those entering through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibrahim finished building the House, he placed the stone next to the wall of Al-Kabah. Or, when the House was finished being built, Ibrahim just left the stone where it was last standing, and he was commanded to pray next to the stone when he finished the Tawaf (circumambulating). It is understandable that the Maqam of Ibrahim would stand where the building of the House ended. The Leader of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab, one of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs whom we were commanded to emulate, moved the stone away from the Kabah&#8217;s wall during his reign. Umar is one of the two men, whom the Messenger of Allah described when he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَبِي بَكْرٍ وَعُمَر»</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imitate the two men who will come after me: Abu Bakr and Umar.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar was also the person whom the Qur&#8217;an agreed with regarding praying next to Maqam of Ibrahim. This is why none among the Companions rejected it when he moved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ibn Jurayj from Ata&#8217;, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab moved the Maqam back.&#8221; Also, Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Mujahid said that Umar was the first person who moved the Maqam back to where it is now standing.&#8221; Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr, Ahmad bin Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Bayhaqi recorded A&#8217;ishah saying, &#8220;<strong>During the time of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr, the Maqam was right next to the House. Umar moved the Maqam during his reign</strong>.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration.</p>

<p><strong>Posted from</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/17/tafseer-explanation-surah-al-baqarah-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah Al-Baqarah</strong></a> – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En]. Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allah commanded that He be appreciated, He ordained patience and prayer. It is a fact that the servant is either enjoying a bounty that he should be thankful for, or suffering a calamity that he should meet with patience. A Hadith states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amazing is the believer, for whatever Allah decrees for him, it is better for him! If he is tested with a bounty, he is grateful for it and this is better for him; and if he is afflicted with a hardship, he is patient with it and this is better for him.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has stated that the best tools to help ease the effects of the afflictions are patience and prayer. Earlier we mentioned Allah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And seek help in patience and As-Salah </strong>(the prayer)<strong> and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for <em>Al-Khashiin</em> (</strong>i.e., the true believers in Allah<strong>)</strong></span> (2:45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several types of Sabr ـ patience: one for avoiding the prohibitions and sins, one for acts of worship and obedience. The second type carries more rewards than the first type. There is a third type of patience required in the face of the afflictions and hardships, which is mandatory, like repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sabr has two parts: patience for the sake of Allah concerning what He is pleased with (i.e., acts of worship and obedience), even if it is hard on the heart and the body, and patience when avoiding what He dislikes, even if it is desired. Those who acquire these qualities will be among the patient persons whom Allah shall greet (when they meet Him in the Hereafter; refer to Surat Al-Ahzab 33:44), Allah willing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Introduction to Tafseer – Ibn Taymiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<br />
Taken from Tafseer Soorat-in-Naba’<br />
Compiled and translated by Abu Talhah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah’s refuge from the evils of our selves and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides then none can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner; and I testify that Muhammad is his Slave and His Messenger.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah, by obeying Him and avoiding disobedience to Him, as He deserves to be feared </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Obey Him and do not disobey Him; give thanks to Him and do not show ingratitude; remember Him and do not forget Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and do not die except as Muslims: obediently submitting to Him, and worshipping Him alone</span></strong>.] [Soorah Aali `Imraan (3): 102]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mankind! Fear and be dutiful to your Lord, Who alone created you from a single person</strong> (Aadam)<strong>, and from him He created his mate, and from these two He produced many men and women; and fear and be dutiful to Allaah through Whom you ask each other for your rights, and beware of cutting ties of kinship. Allaah is ever a Watcher over you</strong></span>.]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah and speak with truth and justice, and He will rectify your deeds for you and forgive your sins; and whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has attained tremendous success</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To proceed:</strong></span> Then the truest speech is the Book of Allaah -the Most High, and the best way is the way of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم); and the worst of affairs are those things which are new introductions (into the Religion) and every new introduction is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance will be in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Ummah (the Islamic nation) has a great and pressing need to understand the Qur·aan, which is the strong Rope of Allaah, and the wise Reminder; one who follows it will not be led astray by desires, and it will not become confused upon the tongues. It does not become dull through repetition, its wonders never cease, and the scholars can never have enough of it. Whoever speaks in accordance with it will speak the truth, whoever acts in accordance with it will be rewarded; whoever judges by it has judged justly, and whoever calls to it then he invites to the straight path. Whichever tyrant abandons it then Allaah will break him, and whoever seeks guidance in other than it then Allaah will misguide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ &#8211; وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ &#8211; قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِي أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًا &#8211; قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then if guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance shall not go astray and he shall not be wretched; but whoever turns away from My Reminder then he shall have a bleak and constricted life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind. He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind when I used to have sight in the world?’ He will say: ‘Thus it is: Our signs came to you and you turned away from and abandoned them, and so this Day you shall be abandoned</strong></span>.]] [Soorah TaaHaa (20): 123-126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا كُنتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ ۚ قَدْ جَاءَكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ &#8211;  يَهْدِي بِهِ اللَّهُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَهُ سُبُلَ السَّلَامِ وَيُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, explaining to you much of that which you used to hide from the Scripture, and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allaah a light and a clear Book. By it Allaah guides those who seek His Pleasure to the path which leads to safety and salvation; and He brings them out of darkness into the light, by His Permission, and He guides to the Straight Path</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): 15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الر ۚ كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ &#8211; اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Alif Laam Raa. This is a book which We have sent down to you, in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the One worthy of all praise: Allaah, to Whom belongs everything that is in the heavens and in the earth</strong></span>.]] [Soorah Ibraaheem (14): 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا ۚ مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ وَلَٰكِن جَعَلْنَاهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِي بِهِ مَن نَّشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ أَلَا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَصِيرُ الْأُمُورُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We have revealed this Qur·aan to you, as a mercy, by Our Command. You did not know what the Book is, nor what is Faith. But We have made it a light by which We guide whomever We wish from Our servants. And you certainly guide Our servants towards the Straight Path: the Path of Allaah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Certainly all affairs shall return to Allaah for judgement</strong></span>.]] [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 52-53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; It is binding that a person should know that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) explained the meaning of the Qur·aan to his Companions, just as he made clear to them its Words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </span></h3>
<p>[Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down this Qur·aan to you, O Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, as a reminder to them, so that you should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>][1] includes both this and that [i.e. the Words and the meaning.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan as-Sulamee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Those who taught us the recitation of the Qur·aan, such as `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan, `Abdullah ibn Mas`ood, and others, when they had learned ten Aayahs from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), would not go beyond them until they had learned what they contained from knowledge and action. They said: So we learned the Qur·aan, and knowledge, and action, together.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore they used to remain for a period of time learning a Soorah, and Anas said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>When a man had learned </strong>[Soorah] <strong>al-Baqarah and </strong>[Soorah] <strong>Aali `Imraan he attained stature in our eyes</strong></span>” [3], and Ibn `Umar took some years to learn al-Baqarah, it is said that it was eight years; Maalik mentioned it. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was because Allaah -the Most High- has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This Qur·aan is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may reflect upon its Aayahs</strong></span>.]] { [Soorah Saad (38): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will they not carefully reflect upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not reflected upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23): 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And carefully reflecting upon speech is not possible without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p>[Soorah Yoosuf (12): 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur·aan, in order that you may comprehend its meaning]]</span></strong>, and comprehending speech includes understanding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also known that what is intended from all speech is that its meaning be understood, not just its wording, so the Qur·aan has more right to that; and also the normal behaviour of the people prevents them from reading a book in any field of knowledge, be it medicine or mathematics, and then not seeking necessary explanation of it. So how about the Speech of Allaah, which is their essential safeguard, and through which they are to attain salvation and bliss, and by means of which their Religion and their worldly lives are correctly established?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why disagreement amongst the Companions with regard to the tafseer of the Qur·aan was extremely rare; and even though it occurred more amongst the Taabi`een (the Successors of the Companions) than it did amongst the Companions, then still it was little in comparison to what occurred with those who came after them. So the more excellent a time was, then the greater the unity, the harmony, the knowledge, and the clarity of understanding was in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Taabi`een there were those who learned the whole tafseer from the Companions, just as Mujaahid said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I went through the whole mus-haf with Ibn `Abbaas, stopping him at every Aayah and asking him about it</strong></span>.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore ath-Thawree said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid, then it will suffice you</strong></span>.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree, and others from the people of knowledge; and likewise Imaam Ahmad, and others who wrote works of tafseer, would repeatedly quote chains of narration from Mujaahid, more so than from others besides him. So what is intended is that the Taabi`een took the tafseer from the Companions, just as they took knowledge of the Sunnah from them&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Tafseer, then the people who were most knowledgeable about it were the people of Makkah, since they were the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Mujaahid</strong>, `<strong>Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah</strong>, `<strong>Ikrimah</strong>-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, and others from the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Taawoos</strong>, <strong>AbushSha`thaa</strong>·, <strong>Sa`eed ibn Jubayr</strong>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the people of al-Koofah, from the students of Ibn Mas`ood, and they had distinction in some of that over others; and the scholars of tafseer from the people of al-Madeenah, such as Zayd ibn Aslam &#8211; whom Maalik took tafseer from, and likewise his [i.e. Zayd’s] son `Abdur-Rahmaan took it from him (also), and `Abdullaah ibn Wahb took it from `AbdurRahmaan&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in summary, whoever turns away from the positions of the Companions and the Taabi`een, and their tafseer, in favour of something contrary to that, then he is in error in doing that, indeed he is an innovator; unless if he is performing legitimate ijtihaad, in which case his error is forgiven&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if someone were to say: ‘<strong>What is the best approach with regard to Tafseer?</strong>’ Then the answer is that the most correct approach is to explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan. So what has been left unspecified at one place will be explained at another place, and what is mentioned briefly at one point will be detailed elsewhere&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you become unable to do that, then take hold of the Sunnah, for the Sunnah explains and clarifies the Qur·aan&#8230;, and when we do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, then we refer back for that to the sayings of the Companions, for they knew best about it because of what they actually witnessed relating to the Qur·aan, and because of the circumstances particular to them, and because of their complete understanding, their correct knowledge, and their righteous deeds&#8230; And if you do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, nor do you find it from the Companions, then many of the imaams refer back in that case to the statements of the Taabi`een, such as Mujaahid ibn Jabr&#8230; and such as Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, al-Hasan al-Basree, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Sa`eed ibn alMusayyib, Abul-`Aaliyah, ar-Rabee` ibn Anas, Qataadah, ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, and others from the Taabi`een, and those who succeeded them, and those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their sayings are mentioned with regard to an Aayah, and the wordings which they used may differ, and so one who has no knowledge may think that they are disagreements, when this is not actually the case. So some of them may refer to something by mentioning that which it necessitates, or by mentioning that which corresponds to it, and some of them may state the actual thing itself; and all of these actually have the same meaning, and this occurs in many places, so let the discerning person be alert to this; and Allaah is the One Who guides.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (p. 58): “Ibn Mas`ood said, as reported by Ibn Abee Haatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is nothing except that it has been made clear to us in the Qur·aan, however our understanding falls short of reaching it, so therefore He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ وَالزُّبُرِ ۗ وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So that you, O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>]].’ { [Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (2/437): “at-Tabaree reported it in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/60), and as-Samarqandee in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/71) and Ibn Sa`d in ‘at-Tabaqaat’ (6/172), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’:..6/117, and its chain of narration contains `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib:Sadooq (truthful), whose memory deteriorated; however the narrator from him is Hammaad ibn Zayd, as occurs in ‘as-Siyar’ (4/269), and his narrations from him are good&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Imaam Ahmad (3/120). Shu`ayb al-Arnawoot said in his checking of the ‘Musnad’ (no. 12236): “Its chain of narration is ‘saheeh’ to the standard of the two Shaikhs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Imaam Maalik stated in his ‘Muwatta·’ (1/205) that it had reached him (balaaghan) that `Abdullaah ibn `Umar had remained for eight years learning Sooratul-Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Fawwaaz Ahmad Zumarlee said in his checking of as-Suyootee’s ‘<em>al-Itqaan</em>’ (2/473): “It was reported in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/280)..; and it was reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’(1/65), and Aboo Nu`aym in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/279-280); and its chain of narration contains Muhammad ibn Ishaaq who narrated it with both of them with `an`anah (without stating that he had heard it directly from the narrator before him); however it has another chain of narration which supports it, since it was also reported by al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam in ‘Fadaa·ilul-Qur·aan’ (p. 216), and by Ahmad in ‘al-Fadaa·il’ (no. 1866), and its chain of narration contains Ibn Abee Najeeh, who reported a great amount from Mujaahid; but he would narrate from him things that he had not heard directly from him. Refer to ‘Tabaqaatul-Mudalliseen’ (p. 9).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/65).</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AT-TABAREE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Jareer ibn Yazeed, Aboo Ja`far at-Tabaree: “The imaam, the outstanding scholar, the Mujtahid. The scholar of his time: Aboo Ja`far at-Tabaree, the author of excellent works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was from the people of Aamul in Tabaristaan (a town 80 miles NE of Tehran in Persia). He was born in the year 224 H, and began seeking knowledge after the year 240 H. He travelled greatly and met the preeminent men. He was singular amongst the people of his time in knowledge, intellect and in the great number of his works. It is rare that anyone the like of him is seen&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee said of him: ‘He gathered such branches of knowledge as were not attained by anyone from the people of his time. He had memorised the Book of Allaah; he was knowledgeable of the different modes of recitation; he had insight of the meaning; he was a learned jurist with regard to the rulings contained in the Qur·aan; he was a scholar of the details of the Sunnah and of its chains of narration; the authentic and the unauthentic; he knew the abrogating texts and the abrogated texts; he was knowledgeable of the sayings of the Companions and the Taabi`een; he was well-acquainted with the past events and history of the peoples, and he compiled the famous book: ‘Narratives and history of the nations’; and he compiled his ‘Tafseer’: the like of which has not been written. He also wrote a book entitled ‘Tahdheeb-Aathaar’, and I have not seen a similar work the like of it, but he did not complete it. He also wrote many books about the principles and details of Fiqh, and his preferred sayings from the sayings of the jurists. He had certain verdicts specific to him which were preserved’.” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ of adh-Dhahabee: (14/267-)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his Tafseer (printed in thirty volumes) Aboo Haamid alIsfaraayeenee said: “If a person were to travel to China to obtain the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer it would not be too much.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: “As for the Tafseers that the people have with them, then the most authentic of them is the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, because he mentions the sayings reported from the Salaf with established chains of narration, and it does not contain innovation, and he does not report from those accused of being liars such as Muqtaatil ibn Bukayr and al-Kalbee.” [‘Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa’:13/385]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said, concerning his ‘Tafseer’: “He authored a complete Tafseer which is such that it has no equal,” and concerning him: “He had high standing in worship, zuhd (abstaining from the unnecessary things of this world), piety, and establishing the truth: not being prevented from that by the blame of anyone. He had a fine voice in recitation, along with complete knowledge of the modes of recitation &#8211; upon the finest characteristics. He was one of the major righteous people, and one of the scholars of hadeeth who gathered in Egypt in the time of Ibn Tooloon; and they were: Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah &#8211; the imaam of the imaams, Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazee, Muhammad ibn Haaroon arRuwayaanee, and this one: Muhammad ibn Jareer at-Tabaree…” [‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (11/156-)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Firghaanee said: “Muhammad ibn Jareer was of those who did not care about the blame of anyone for Allaah’s sake, along with the very great harm he suffered and the slanders he received from the ignorant, envious and apostates; but as for the people of knowledge and Religion, then they do not deny his knowledge, his abstinence with regard to this world and how he renounced it. He sufficed himself with a small inheritance left for him by his father in Tabaristaan.” And al-Firghaanee said: “I heard him say: “My father’s inheritance has been delayed, so I had to remove the sleeves of my robe and sell them.” [‘Tabaqaatush-Shaafi`iyyah’: (3/120), quoted in Dr. `Abdullaah at-Turkee’s introduction to ‘Jaami`ul-Bayaan’.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned about him that everyday for forty years he would fill forty pages with his writing; and that he originally proposed dictating his ‘history’ of a length of thirty thousand pages, and his Tafseer of similar length, but was dissuaded by his students and so reduced each of them to a tenth of the intended size, saying: “Indeed we belong to Allaah! Peoples’ eagerness has died!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as-Suyootee said in ‘al-Itqaan’ (2/476): “So if you were to say: ‘Which of the tafseers do you direct us towards, and tell a person to rely upon?’ Then I say: The tafseer of Aboo Ja`far ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, about which the reputable scholars have agreed that its like has not been written in the field of tafseer. an-Nawawee said in his ‘Tahdheeb’: ‘No one has written the like of the book of Ibn Jareer in tafseer’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away at the time of Maghrib on the night of the 28th of Shawwal in the year 310 H, at the age of 86 -rahimahullaah.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AS-SAM`AANEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The imaam, the outstanding scholar, the Muftee of Khuraasaan, Shaikh of the Shaafi`ees; Abul-Muzaffar Mansoor ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Jabbaar ibn Ahmad, at-Tameemee, as-Sam`aanee, al-Marwazee, previously alHanafee, then ash-Shaafi`ee. He was born in the year 426 H…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went out on foot to perform Hajj at a time when riding parties were prevented from travelling, so he and a group of people were captured by brigands. So he bore this with patience until Allaah freed him from these bedouins, and he performed Hajj and accompanied az-Zanjaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to relate: &lt; They took us captive, so I used to tend their camels. So it happened that their chief wanted to marry off his daughter, so they said: we will have to travel to a town to find someone to perform the marriage for us. So one of their men said: ‘The man who tends our camels is the jurist of Khuraasaan.’ So they asked me about some matters, and I answered them, and I spoke to them in correct Arabic, so they became embarrassed and excused themselves. So I performed the marriage for them, and said the (marriage) address, so they were happy and asked me to accept some reward from that, but I refused. So they conveyed me to Makkah in the middle of the year. &gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Ghaafir said in his ‘Taareekh’: “He was the singular scholar of his age in excellence and behaviour, and in zuhd and piety. He came from a household of knowledge and zuhd. He acquired knowledge of Fiqh from his father, and he became one of the foremost amongst the people of speculation. He then studied the books of hadeeth, performed Hajj and returned, and abandoned the way upon which he had debated for thirty years and became a Shaafi`ee. He manifested this in the year 468 H and the people of Marw were thrown into turmoil and the common folk became perplexed. So letters were sent concerning him by the Ameer of Balkh which spoke harshly against him. So he left Marw in the company of DhulMajdayn Abul-Qaasim al-Moosawee and a group of students, and he was attended to by a number of the jurists. So he went to Toos, and proceeded on to Naysaaboor. So he was met by the students with a great reception in the time of Nizaamul-Mulk, and `Ameedul-Hadrah Aboo Sa`d. So they honoured him and gave him a position of great respect, and a gathering for admonition was established for him in the Shaafi`ee school; and he was an ocean with regard to admonition and he was a great memorizer, so he was greatly accepted by the people. He attained firmness and prominence in the Shaafi`ee madhhab and then he returned to Marw and taught there in the Shaafi`ee school, and an-Nizaam gave him precedence over his peers, and his students became apparent. Then he went off to Asbahaan in a state of high standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote the book ‘al-Istilaam,’ and the book ‘al-Burhaan,’ and ‘alAmaalee’ in Hadeeth, and he stood firmly with the people of the Hadeeth, the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah; and he was a thorn in the eyes of the opponents, and a proof for the people of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[His grandson] Aboo Sa`d said: ‘My grandfather wrote a work of Tafseer, and in Fiqh, Usool and Hadeeth. His Tafseer is of three volumes’ … The Imaam Aboo `Alee ibn as-Saffaar said: ‘When I debate with AbulMuzaffar then it is as if I am debating with an imaam from the Taabi`een, because of the signs of the righteous people which I see in him.’ He also said about himself: “I never forgot anything which I had memorized.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; He died in the year 489 H, having lived for sixty-three years &#8211; rahimahullaah.” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (19/114-119)] Ibn al-`Imaad said about him in ‘Shadharaatudh-Dhahab’ (3/393): “The imaam, the eminent scholar, Abul-Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee Mansoor ibn Muhammad, at-Tameemee, al-Marwazee, al-Hanafee, then ash-Shaafi`ee. He learned Fiqh from this father and from others, and he was the imaam of his age in the madhhab of Aboo Haneefah. But when he performed Hajj, that which necessitated his moving to the madhhab of ash-Shaafi`ee became clear to him in al-Hijaaz. So when he returned to Marw he suffered great harm because of his changing over. He wrote many books regarding the Shaafi`ee madhhab and he wrote in refutation of the opponents, and he wrote ‘at-Tabaqaat’ which he excelled in, and he wrote a good and fine Tafseer…” -rahimahullaah.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AL-BAGHAWEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Shaikhul-Islaam, the outstanding exemplary scholar, the Haafiz: ShaikhulIslaam, the reviver of the Sunnah, Aboo Muhammad al-Husayn ibn Mas`ood ibn Muhammad ibn al-Farraa·, al-Baghawee, ash-Shaafi`ee: the scholar of Tafseer; the compiler of works such as ‘Sharhus-Sunnah,’ ‘Ma`aalimut-Tanzeel,’ ‘al-Masaabeeh’ and the book ‘at-Tahdheeb’ upon the madhhab, and ‘al-Jam`u baynas-Saheehayn,’ and ‘al-Arba`eena hadeethan’ and other works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired knowledge of Fiqh from the Shaikh of the Shaafi`ees al-Qaadee Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Marwaroodhee, the author of ‘at-Ta`leeqah,’ before the year 460 H….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee was given the title ‘Muhiyyus-Sunnah’ (the reviver of the Sunnah), and the ‘the pillar of the Religion’, and he was a person of nobility and an Imaam. He was a person of knowledge and outstanding scholar. He abstained from the superfluous things of this world and was satisfied with a little. He used to eat dry bread on its own, but was criticised by people for that, so he began accompanying it with oil. His father used to make and sell fur garments (al-Farraa·). He was granted blessing in his writings, and granted complete acceptance with regard to them: this was on account of his fine resolve, and true and sincere intention. The scholars vied in acquiring his works, and he would not deliver a lesson except in a state of purification. He was moderate in his dress: he wore a crude robe, and a small turban &#8211; upon the way of the Salaf- which he wore and tied as they did. He was firmly established in Tafseer, and fully proficient in Fiqh -may Allaah have mercy upon him…” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ of adh-Dhahabee: (19/439-)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the town of Bagh (30 miles NW of Herat in Afghanistan) in Khuraasaan, and travelled throughout Khuraasaan seeking knowledge, finally settling in Marw ar-Roodh (SE Turkmenistan) where he taught and compiled his works, and died in the year of 516 H at over eighty years of age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: “…He excelled in the branches of knowledge, and he was the foremost scholar of his time in them. He adhered to the Religion, was pious, a ‘zaahid,’ and a righteous worshipper.” -rahimahullaah. [‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah (12/206).’]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">IBN KATHEER:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is Abul-Fidaa·, `Imaadud-Deen, Ismaa`eel ibn (ash-Shaikh Abee Hafs Shihaabud-Deen) `Umar &#8211; who was the ‘khateeb of his village &#8211; ibn Katheer ibn Daw· ibn Katheer ibn Zar’ al-Qurashee, al-Basrawee in origin, adDimashqee with regard to his upbringing, nurturing and education. He was born in the town of Mijdal, in the district of the town of Busraa, to the [north-] east of Damascus, in the year of 701 H, and his father was a khateeb. His father died when he was four years old, so he was brought up by his brother, the Shaikh `Abdul-Wahhaab, and he learned Fiqh from him at the beginning of his affair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he moved to Damascus in the year 706 H, at the age of five. He then acquired knowledge of Fiqh from Shaikh Burhaanuddeen Ibraaheem ibn</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Rahmaan al-Fazaaree, well known as Ibn al-Firkaah &#8211; who died in the year 729 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also heard in Damascus from `Eesaa ibn al-Muta&#8220;im, and from Ahmad ibn Abee Taalib &#8211; who lived more than a hundred years and who was well known as Ibnush-Shihnah, and also known as al-Hajjaar -who died in year 730 H. Also from al-Qaasim ibn `Asaakir, and Ibnush-Sheeraazee, Ishaaq ibn al-Aamidee, and Muhammad ibn Zarraad. He closely accompanied the Shaikh Jamaaluddeen Yoosuf ibn az-Zakiyy al-Mizzee &#8211; the author of ‘Tahdheebul-Kamaal’ and ‘Atraaful-Kutubis-Sittah’ who died in the year 742 H; and he greatly benefited from him and became proficient in knowledge, and he married his daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied a great deal with Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah, who died in the year 728 H. He closely accompanied him, loved him and benefited from his knowledge. He also studied with the Shaikh, the Haafiz, the historian Shamsuddeen adh-Dhahabee Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Qaaymaaz, who died in the year 748 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was granted ‘ijaazah’ (permission to narrate) in Egypt by Aboo Moosaa al-Qaraafee, and al-Husaynee, and `Alee ibn `Umar al-Waanee, Yoosuf alHutanee and others. Al-Haafiz Shamsuddeen adh-Dhahabee said of him in ‘al-Mu`jamulMukhtass’: “The imaam, the muftee, the outstanding muhaddith, the precise jurist, the critical and precise scholar of tafseer. He has a number of beneficial works.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said of him in ‘ad-Durarul-Kaaminah’: “He became occupied with hadeeth, carefully studying its texts and narrators. He could quote a great deal from memory and was delightful in speech. His works spread widely in his lifetime, and people benefited from them after his death. He was not upon the way of those muhadditheen who merely seek briefer chains of narration, and seek to distinguish shorter from longer chains of narration and other such disciplines of theirs; rather he was from the jurists of the muhadditheen.’…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His works included:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ‘Tafseerul-Qur·aanil-Kareem,’ and it was one of the most beneficial books of tafseer based upon narrations. He would explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan, and then with the famous ahaadeeth from the dependable sources of the muhadditheen &#8211; along with their chains of narration. He discussed the chains of narration with the terms of rejection and acceptance, and made clear anything the narrations contained with regard to strangeness, being contrary to what is authentic, or confliction with the reliable reports. Then he would mention the reported sayings from the Companions and the Taabi`een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyootee said: “The like of it, similar in form, has not been written.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) His history entitled ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah,’ in which he mentioned the stories of the Prophets and the previous nations, based upon what occurs in the Noble Qur·aan and the authentic narrations…then he carefully detailed the Prophetic Seerah, and the history of Islaam to his time. Then he went on to mention the tribulations, signs of the Last Hour, the forthcoming battles and the conditions in the Hereafter….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died on Thursday, the 26th of Sha`baan in the year 774 H, at the age of 74; and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: He lost his eyesight at the end of his life &#8211; rahimahullaah wa radiyallaahu `anhu.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the introduction to ‘al-Baa`ithul-Hatheeth’; the biography was compiled by Shaikh Muhammad `Abdur-Razzaaq Hamzah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-`Imaad said in ‘Shadharaatudh-Dhahab’ (6/231/232): “…He had many students; from them was Ibn Hajjee who said about him: ‘He was the greatest memorizer of the texts of hadeeth that we have come across, and the one best acquainted with their defects, and their narrators, and the authentic and the unauthentic from them, and his peers and his Shaikhs acknowledged that for him. I do not think, despite the frequency with which I went to him, that I ever met him except I took benefit from him.’ Others, as Qaadee Shahbah mentioned in his ‘Tabaqaat’ stated that he was a particularly close student of Ibn Taimiyyah, and used to defend him and follow many of his views; and he used to give verdict with his view regarding divorce, and he was put to trial because of it and suffered harm. He died in Sha`baan, and was buried…next to his Shaikh, Ibn Taimiyyah.” -rahimahullaah.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ASH-SHAWKAANEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn `Alee ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdullaah, ash-Shawkaanee, then as-San`aanee [the capital of Yemen]. He was born on Monday the 28th of Dhul-Qa`dah in 1173 H in the town of Hijrah Shawkaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He grew up in the manner of students of legislated knowledge, memorizing the Qur·aan and becoming proficient in it, and he memorized many of the texts before he began serious study by the age of ten. Then he sat with the major Shaikhs, and he greatly occupied himself with studying history in the sciences of the language. His father did not allow him to occupy himself with other than knowledge, nor to leave San`aa. He sat to deliver verdicts at the age of twenty, and he had thirteen lessons each day: some he delivered, and others he studied with his Shaikhs. [‘al-Badrut-Taali`’: (2/215, 218-219)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He authored 278 works, including works of Tafseer, Fiqh, Usoolul-Fiqh, the `Aqeedah of the Salaf, and in refutation of blind-following (taqleed). al-`Allaamah Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Bahkalee said…: (start of quote): “In the year 1250 H, in the month of Jumaadal-Aakhirah, our Shaikh Muhammad ibn `Alee ash-Shawkaanee passed away. He was the judge of the whole community, Shaikhul-Islaam, the verifier, the `Allaamah, the imaam, sultaan of the scholars, imaam of the world….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, he did not see anyone the like of himself; nor did he see anyone who had seen the like of him in knowledge, piety and establishment of the truth with strength of spirit and eloquence of tongue…. He was born on Monday, the 28th of the sacred month of Dhul-Qa`dah in the year 1172 H….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He studied under his father, and studied continuously under the Qaadee, imaam of the details of Fiqh in his time Ahmad ibn Muhammad alHaraazee, and he derived benefit from him in Fiqh… He learned Arabic grammar and morphology from as-Sayyid al-`Allaamah Ismaa`eel ibn Hasan, and al-`Allaamah `Abdullaah ibn Ismaa`eel an-Nahmee, and al- `Allaamah al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad al-Khawlaanee… and in many of the branches of knowledge he studied constantly with the reviver of his time as Sayyid `Abdul-Qaadir ibn Ahmad al-Kawkabaanee; and in the science of hadeeth he took from al-Haafiz `Alee ibn Ibraaheem ibn `Aamir, and from other Shaikhs besides them….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He authored magnificent, delightful, beneficial, and useful works in most branches of knowledge; from them ‘Naylul-Awtaar’ &#8211; a commentary upon ‘Muntaqal-Akhbaar’ of [Majduddeen `Abdus-Salaam] Ibn Taimiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah- in four volumes the like of which is not to be seen in these times with regard to its careful verification and precision. He gave each matter its due right, with justice and fairness; and did not adhere to blindfollowing. He quoted the positions of the later scholars and of the Predecessors. His noble Shaikhs and other prominent scholars related it from him, and it spread throughout the lands in his lifetime. It was read to him many times, and the scholars derived benefit from it; and it was the only one out of his works that he was personally satisfied with, because of its high level of accuracy, and its close adherence to proof in the best manner. He wrote it during the lifetime of his Shaikhs, and they were able to point out certain points, which he edited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also wrote the large Tafseer entitled ‘Fathul-Qadeer’ which combined the sciences of narration of hadeeth, and its understanding… … And I [i.e. his student Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Bahkalee] learned from him in many of the fields of knowledge, and I took from him most of his noble works, and with his death the shining lamp of Yemen was extinguished for them; and I do not think that in precision and verification they will see the like of him.” (end of quote.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Lord of creation, the One free of all imperfections-blessed this Qaadee and Imaam from the vast ocean of His Generosity with three things which I do not know to have been combined in these later times for anyone besides him: Firstly: Vast and deep knowledge of all the different branches, types and forms of knowledge; secondly: the great number of students he had who were verifiers, people of nobility and precision: people of discerning intellect, and outstanding virtues…; thirdly: the great number of his skilled and precise works, and his intricate treatises and responses which in their number outstripped great scholars, and whose precision and exactness reached every possible limit…”-rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘at-Taajul-Mukallal’ (pp.452-461) of `Allaamah Siddeeq Hasan Khaan alQanoojee; and the introduction to ‘Fathul-Qadeer.’]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>AS-SA`DEE:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ash-Shaikh Aboo `Abdillaah `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn `Abdillaah ibn Naasir Aal-Sa`dee, from the tribe of Tameem. He was born in the town of `Unayzah in the district of al-Qaseem [Saudi Arabia], on the 12th of Muharram 1307 H and his mother died when he was four years old. Then his father died when he was seven years old, so he grew up as an orphan. However he had a fine up bringing and it was noticed that from an early age he was distinguished by intelligence and a desire to learn. He read the whole Qur·aan after the death of his father and then memorized it completely, and he was fully proficient in it at the age of eleven. Then he occupied himself with acquiring knowledge from the scholars of his land, and from those who came to his land. So he strove and exerted himself until he acquired a good portion of every branch of knowledge. Upon reaching the age of twentythree he sat to teach. So he would learn and also teach, and spend all of his time in that. This continued until the year 1350 H, when he took charge of all teaching in his town, and all students referred back to him. He took knowledge from Shaikh Ibraaheem ibn Hamd ibn Jaasir, and he was the first teacher he studied with. He described his Shaikh as a memorizer of hadeeth, and he would speak about his piety and how he used to love and take care of the poor. Often a poor person would come to him in winter and he would take off one of his two garments and give it to the poor person, even though he himself needed it and possessed very little himself &#8211; rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from his Shaikhs was Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Kareem ash-Shibl, with whom he learned Fiqh, sciences of Arabic language and other than that. He also studied with ash-Shaikh Saalih ibn `Uthmaan al-Qaadee, the judge of `Unayzah. He learnt from him Tawheed, Tafseer, Fiqh: its Usool and its details, and the sciences of the Arabic language. He was the one whom he studied with the most, and he kept his company constantly until he passed away -rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied with Shaikh `Abdullaah ibn `Aayid, and Shaikh Sa`b alQuwayjaree, and Shaikh `Alee as-Sinaanee, and Shaikh `Alee an-Naasir Aboo Waadee with whom he studied hadeeth, and took the six books and others from him with ‘ijaazah’ (permission to narrate).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied with Shaikh Muhammad ibn ash-Shaikh `Abdul-`Azeez Aal Muhammad al-Maani` (the director of cultural/educational affairs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at present); he studied with him in `Unayzah. Also from his Shaikhs was Shaikh Muhammad ash-Shanqeetee (who settled in the Hijaaz…) when he came to teach in `Unayzah. He studied with him Tafseer, Hadeeth, the sciences of Hadeeth, and the sciences of the language &#8211; such as grammar, morphology and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was upon a high level of virtuous manners, showing humility with the young and the old, and the rich and the poor. He used to spend some of his time sitting in gatherings with whoever wished to attend, so the gathering would be a gathering of knowledge. He was keen that these gatherings should discuss matters of knowledge and social affairs, and the people of the gatherings would derive great benefit from the useful discussions they involved themselves in. So their recreational gatherings were turned into gatherings of worship and knowledge. He would speak to each person with whatever befitted him, and would discuss with him matters that would be beneficial to his worldly life and his Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would frequently resolve dispute in a just manner which satisfied both sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had great concern for the poor, the needy, and strangers and he would personally assist them as far as he was able, and he would encourage the wealthy people &#8211; those whom he knew to love doing good &#8211; to be compassionate towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was upon a very high level of good manners, chastity, purity of spirit, and firmly resolved and serious in all his affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also the best of people in his manner of teaching, and the best at causing his students to understand…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He occupied himself most of all and benefited most from the books of Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and his student Ibnul-Qayyim. This benefited him greatly with regard to knowledge of Usool, Tawheed, Tafseer, and Fiqh and other branches of beneficial knowledge…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was especially proficient in Tafseer, having read a number of Tafseers and excelling in it. He authored a fine Tafseer, in a number of volumes…entitled ‘Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee Tafseer KalaamilMannaan’.… He passed away at the age of 69 in the year 1376 in the town of `Unayzah &#8211; rahimahullaah…”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof is He the Most High’s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> (those who truly believe) and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> [103:1-3]</strong><sup style="text-align:justify;">11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that you learn these four matters in detail – is there any proof for what the Shaikh has said? That it is obligatory upon us to learn these four matters, and he has promised us that he will not say anything except with a proof, so where is the proof? The proof upon that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Bismillaahirra<u>h</u>maanirra<u>h</u>eem</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> </strong>[103:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em>”, <strong>this is the first matter</strong>: knowledge, because <em>eemaan</em> cannot be except through knowledge, which is awareness of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, awareness of His Prophet and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second matter: </strong>“And they perform the righteous deeds”, this is action upon the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third matter: </strong>“And they enjoin each other with the truth”, this is calling to the knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter:</strong> “And they enjoin each other with patience”, upon harm in the path of calling to knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time.</span> </strong>[103:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>Waw</em>”, is the <em>waw-ul-qasm</em> (the <em>‘waw’</em> of an oath). And <em>Al-‘A<u>s</u>r </em>is a noun upon which an oath is sworn and it is <em>majroor</em>, and the sign that it is <em>majroor</em> is that it has a <em>kasrah</em> upon it. And what is meant is Time and a time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, swears by a time period and by Time, and it is something created. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, swears by whatever He wishes from the creation, but the creation may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And Allaah does not swear an oath except by something which has importance, and which contains a Sign from His Signs, He the Perfect and Most High. So this Time, contains a lesson and has importance, and therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time, and He swore by the night when it covers, and He swore an oath by the daytime brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the creation, then he may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And it is not permissible for us to swear an oath by other than Allaah. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever swears an oath by other than Allaah, then he has committed unbelief or he has committed shirk.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is going to swear an oath, then let him swear by Allaah or let him keep silent.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah swears by whatever he wishes and he does not swear except by something which has importance and which contains a lesson, so what is the lesson here in this Time? The lessons are tremendous, the succession of the night and the day, and how they interchange and take from each other, this one taking from that one, and that one taking from this one, and they succeed each other in this amazing ordered manner which does not vary or alter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the Ability of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And then, whatever occurs within this Time from events and catastrophies and calamities and from favours and blessings and good things, and whatever occurs within this Time, this is from the lessons. And likewise because night and day are an arena for righteous action to be performed in. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> is the One who made the night and the day to follow each other in succession …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they follow each other in succession, this one follows on from this one.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for whoever wants to be reminded of Allaah or whoever wants to give thanks for Allaah’s favours.</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some of the recitations of this <em>aayah, </em>it occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for the one who wants to remember Allaah …</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the night and the day are a tremendous bounty to be earned for a person who utilizes them in obedience to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and the arena for action is the night and the day, you have nothing else besides the night and the day, they are the arena for action and for good and pure earning for this world and the hereafter. So in the night and the day there are lessons and there are benefits, so therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this oath sworn upon? It is His saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mankind is certainly in loss.</span> </strong>[103:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (Mankind) means all of the descendants of Aadam, He did not exclude anyone, neither the kings nor the leaders, nor the rich people nor the poor people, nor the free people nor the slaves, nor the males nor the females. So, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-Insaan</em>”, is for <em>istighraaq</em> – to make the word all-inclusive. All of the descendants of Aadam are in loss, meaning they will be in loss and destruction if they waste this precious Time, and they utilize it in disobedience to Allaah and in doing that which will harm them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this Time which is very cheap with many people, time seems prolonged for them, they become weary and bored, and they say, “<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>We want to kill some time</strong></span>”. So they bring amusements, or they travel abroad to spend a holiday and just to spend some time somewhere, or they laugh and joke to use up time. So those people, they use it up and waste it – then it will be loss and regret upon them on the Day of Resurrection. And it could be the source of their true happiness, if only they took care of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the descendants of Aadam are in loss and destruction, except for those who have the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">four qualities</span></strong> which are: knowledge and action and calling to Allaah and having patience upon any harm which the person meets. So whoever has these four qualities will be saved from this loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is not possible except through having knowledge, which is knowledge and awareness of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they perform the righteous and correct deeds</span> </strong>[103:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they perform the righteous deeds from the obligatory duties and the recommended duties. So they utilize their time in performing the righteous deeds in that which will benefit them in their religion and in their worldly life, for even worldly action contains good and can contain reward if it is done with the intention of using it as an aid upon obedience. So how about action for the hereafter. So what is important is that you do not waste the time, rather you use it in something which will be to your advantage and benefit you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with the truth</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They command the good and they forbid the evil and they call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and they teach beneficial knowledge and they propagate knowledge and good amongst the people. They become callers to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with having patience.</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have patience upon whatever strikes them. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>abr</em></strong></span> in the language means <strong>restraining</strong>, and what is meant by it here is restraining oneself upon obedience to Allaah. And it is of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first one is: </strong>Patience upon obedience to Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second one is: </strong>Patience in keeping away from those things which Allaah has forbidden.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third one is:</strong> Having patience with those things which Allaah has Pre-decreed to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the first:</strong> patience upon obedience to Allaah, because the person’s soul desires laziness and desires relaxation, so therefore a person must force it to have patience upon obedience and upon the prayer and upon fasting and upon <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause even though it may dislike these matters, he should cause it to have patience and he should restrain it on obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second: </strong>patience in keeping away from those things Allaah has made forbidden. The soul desires forbidden things and desires. It inclines towards them and is attracted to them, so therefore the person must bind it and restrain it away from the forbidden things, and this requires patience, and it is not easy to prevent the soul from desires and forbidden things. Whoever does not have patience, then his soul will overcome him and incline towards forbidden things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third is: </strong>having patience with the painful things which Allaah has decreed, the calamities which strike a person, from the death of a close relative or loss of wealth or illness which befalls a person, he must have patience upon the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah and he should not become vexed and he should not become angry, rather he should restrain the tongue from wailing and forbidden lamenting and from displaying anger and he should withhold himself from vexation and he should withhold his limbs from striking the cheeks and from tearing the front-opening of the garments. This is patience upon calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for faults, then he should not have patience upon them, rather he should repent to Allaah and flee away from them. However, with regard to calamities which are not something which you yourself have done, rather they are from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He has decreed that they will occur to you as a test and a trial or as a punishment for you for sins which you have committed just as there occurs in His saying the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever calamity strikes you then it is on account of the sins which your hands have committed and Allaah pardons and does not punish, a great deal.</span> </strong>[42:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a calamity strikes the Muslim in his self or in his wealth or in his children or his close relative or one of his brothers from the Muslims, then it is upon him to have patience and to await reward. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا<span style="color:#008000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who, when a calamity strikes them they say, “Indeed we belong to Allaah and we will certainly be returning to Him”. Those people, upon them is praise from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.</span> [2:156-157]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is patience, and from that is having patience upon harm which comes in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, for that is from the calamities. So it is upon you to have patience upon whatever you meet from harm upon the path of good. And do not turn away from doing good, because some people wish to do good, however, if something which he dislikes faces him he then says, “It is not obligatory upon me to enter myself into these matters”. Then he abandons teaching if he is a teacher, he abandons calling to Allaah, he abandons giving the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> if he is a <em>kha<u>t</u>eeb</em> (one who gives the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> in a mosque), he abandons leading the prayer in the mosque, he abandons commanding the good and forbidding the evil – this person has not had patience upon the harm which came to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you are upon error, then it is upon you to turn back to the truth and to correctness, but if you are upon  something true and you have not erred, then it is upon you to have patience and to await and expect reward and to be aware and to feel that this is in the cause of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and that you will receive reward for it, and that you remember the harm which occurred to the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>and how they had patience and how they strove and fought in Allaah’s cause, until Allaah the Mighty and Majestic gave them victory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ الشَّافِعِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ:<span style="color:#808000;"> لَوْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ حُجَّةً عَلَى خَلْقِهِ إِلاَّ هَذِهِ السُّوْرَةَ لَكَفَتْهُمْ</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi‘ee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: “<strong>If Allaah had not sent down any proof upon his creation except this <em>soorah</em>, then that would have sufficed for them</strong>.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Ash-Shaafi‘ee”: He is the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Idrees Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ash-Shaafi‘ee is an ascription to his great great grandfather who was called Shaafi‘, and he was from Quraish from Banul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. He died in the year 204 H, and he was one of the four Imaams. And he said this saying, because Allaah has made clear in this <em>soorah</em> the reasons for wretchedness and the means for true happiness and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the means for true happiness and success is that the person has these four characteristics: knowledge, and action, and calling, and having patience upon harm in the cause of Allaah the Most High. So Allaah’s proof is established upon His creation through this <em>soorah</em>. Allaah the Perfect says to them &#8211; I have made clear to you the means for true happiness in this short and brief <em>soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Qur’aan, all of it, and the Sunnah are details for these four matters. However, this <em>soorah</em> has made clear the means to true happiness and success in general terms, through it the proof has been established upon the creation, and the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah give the details and clarify these four matters. And the speech of Ash-Shaafi‘ee does not mean that this <em>soorah</em> is sufficient for mankind, even if Allaah had not sent down anything else. But rather it has established the proof upon them, because Allaah has made clear in it the means to true happiness and the reasons for total wretchedness, so on the Day of Resurrection no-one can say, “I did not know the means to true happiness and I did not know the reasons leading to total wretchedness”, when he has read this brief and short <em>soorah</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>[11:33 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 01 : Part B</strong><br /><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Author’s Introduction</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">قال رحمه الله:<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</strong></span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: <strong>In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>.<sup>1</sup></span></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[1]: He began, may Allaah have mercy upon him, this treatise with the <strong><em>Basmalah</em></strong>, following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, since the first thing which you see in the <em>mus-<u>h</u>af</em> (the printed copy of the Qur’aan), and before every <em>soorah</em> of it is, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em> (In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore it is used to begin treatises, or letters and books and works following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And likewise the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em> used to write it at the start of his letters when he wrote to the governors and the chiefs and to those who were in the different regions of the earth, calling them to Islaam, he would begin his letter with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em> used to begin his talks and his speech with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm (</em>“In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy”), which shows that beginning with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>, is the sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam, </em>just as Sulaymaan <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> when he wrote to Bilqees, the Queen of Saba’, he began his letter with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>:</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَتْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ إِنِّي أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ </span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">She said: O chiefs, a noble letter has been delivered to me, it is from Sulaymaan, and it reads, “<em>In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</em>”. Do not be haughty, and refuse what I call you to, but rather come to me in submission”</span>. </strong>[27:29-31]</p>



<p>So it is befitting to begin with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>, in every important affair and in every work which has importance and value, and in every letter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore those people who do not begin their works and their letters with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em> , those people have <strong>left the Prophetic sunnah</strong> and <strong>left following the example of the Book of Allaah</strong> the Mighty and Majestic and perhaps because of that these books of theirs and these letters of theirs do not contain blessing and do not contain benefit, because they are deprived of, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>. So therefore, they are deprived of benefit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Why did they abandon,&nbsp;Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm? They abandoned it because it is a sunnah, and <strong>they flee away from the sunnah</strong>, or they <strong>blindly follow those people who flee away from the sunnah</strong>. So it is befitting that attention is given to the like of this.</p>



<p>So the meaning of, Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm, is seeking aid through the Name of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So his saying, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Bismi Allāh</span></strong> (With the Name of Allaah), this is a preposition, and a word which is governed by the preposition, connected to something which is left unmentioned, whose meaning is taken to be, “<strong>I seek aid through the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>”, or, “<strong>I begin with the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>”, seeking blessings by means of it and seeking the aid of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore it is a tremendous preface for speech and for books and for letters, so a person seeks the aid of Allaah in its beginning and seeks blessing by means of His Name, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[4] Question:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaikh, there are many books of tafseer, so which tafseer do you advise (us) to read. May Allaah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Answer: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Tafseer are many, all praise be to Allaah. This is from the blessings of Allaah. However, these books of Tafseer vary – amongst them are those that are long and in depth and those that are short and abridged, as well as those that are free from errors and those that contain errors, particularly in matters of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I advise my brothers from amongst the youth to read is the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Tafseer of Ibn Katheer</span></strong> for it is the greatest of tafseers and the one that uses the best way and method (for interpreting the Qur’aan) in spite of it being abridged. This is since he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) has interpreted the Qur’aan using the Qur’aan first, then by using the Prophetic Sunnah, then with the statements of the Salaf, and finally by using the requisites of Arabic, the language in which it was revealed. So it is a precise and reliable tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tafseer of Al-Baghawee</span></strong> and the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tafseer of Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree</span></strong>, which is a comprehensive and all-inclusive tafseer. These tafseer books are trustworthy. There is also the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>tafseer of Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan As-Sa’adee</strong></span>, which is an excellent tafseer using simple expressions which contain tremendous knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining tafseer books, they are good in some aspects, however they have errors in them, especially in matters of Creed. It is not proper for anyone to read these types of tafseer books except for the person that is proficient in knowledge to the point that he is able to take the good from it and avoid its errors. But as for the beginner, he is not able to do this, so he must take from the tafseer books that do not contain dangers and errors, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the Tafseer of Al-Haafidh Ibn Jareer. All of these books of tafseer are valuable and excellent, all praise be to Allaah.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e.music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allah, the Verses of the Qur&#8217;an) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. And when Our Verses (of the Qur&#8217;an) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a painful torment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Verily, those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, for them are Gardens of delight (Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. To abide therein. It is a Promise of Allah in truth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. He has created the heavens without any pillars, that you see and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it should shake with you. And He has scattered therein moving (living) creatures of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. This is the creation of Allah. So show Me that which those (whom you worship), besides Him have created. Nay, the Zalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers and those who do not believe in the Oneness of Allah) are in plain error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. And indeed We bestowed upon Luqman Al-Hikmah (wisdom and religious understanding, etc.) saying: &#8220;Give thanks to Allah,&#8221; and whoever gives thanks, he gives thanks for (the good of) his ownself. And whoever is unthankful, then verily, Allah is All-Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. And (remember) when Luqman said to his son when he was advising him: &#8220;O my son! Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm (wrong) indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years give thanks to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. &#8220;O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Verily, Allah is Subtle (in bringing out that grain), Well-Aware (of its place).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. &#8220;O my son! Aqim-is-Salat (perform As-Salat), enjoin (people) for Al-Ma&#8217;ruf (Islamic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befall you. Verily! These are some of the important commandments ordered by Allah with no exemption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. &#8220;And turn not your face away from men with pride, nor walk in insolence through the earth. Verily, Allah likes not each arrogant boaster.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. &#8220;And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice. Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.&#8221;</p>

Based upon the Tafseer of Shaykh Ibn Al&#8217;Uthaymeen, rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Opening Soorah (Chapter)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Soorah</em> has been named <em>Al-Faatihah</em> (The Opening) because the Grand Qur’aan is commenced therewith. It is also called <em>Al-Mathaanee</em> (repeatedly recited verses) because it is recited in every <em>Rak’ah</em> (unit of prayer), and it has other names as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. { <strong><span style="color:#008000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span> }</strong>I begin and commence [the task of recitation, or any other lawful task or affair] seeking the aid of the name of Allaah in the accomplishment [of the particular task] and in the pursuance of the right way [in the intended affair], and in petitioning for acceptance [of this or any other good deed].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>الله</strong> </span>} : Allaah is the ‘<em>Alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the <em>Rabb</em>, [01] the Blessed and the Most High, who, and non else besides Him, is worshipped rightfully and deservingly. This is the most particular name of the names of Allaah, the Most High, and cannot be applied to other than Him, the One free of all imperfection<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/tafseer-ul-quran/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>{ <span style="color:#008000;">الرَّحْمَان</span> } Ar-Rahmaan:</strong> The One whose Mercy encompasses the entire creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>{ <span style="color:#008000;">الرَّحِيم</span> } Ar-Raheem:</strong> The One who has Mercy upon the believers. Both, <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> and <em>Ar-Raheem</em>, are two names of the names of Allaah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</strong></span> } This is a statement of praise which Allaah praised Himself with. Implicit therein is an ordinance to His slaves to celebrate His Praise, for He, alone, is the One worthy of [all] praise. And He, the One free of all imperfection (<em>Subhaanahu</em>), is the One who originated all of creation, the One who takes charge (guards, protects, maintains, etc.) of their affairs; the One who nurtures and sustains all of His creation with His favours and blessings, and His friends (<em>awliyaa</em>’) with eemaan (faith) and righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>{ <span style="color:#008000;">الرَّحْمَان</span> } </strong><strong><em>Ar-Rahmaan</em>:</strong> The One whose Mercy encompasses the entire creation.<br />
<strong>{ <span style="color:#008000;">الرَّحِيم</span> } </strong><strong><em>Ar-Raheem</em>:</strong> The One who has Mercy upon the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</strong></span> } : It is He [Allaah], the One free of all imperfection, the only Owner (and the only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Resurrection (<em>Yawmul Qiyaamah</em>) which is the Day of Requital of deeds. Restricting [His] Dominion to the Day of Recompense (<em>Yawmuddeen</em>) is because no one will claim [the ownership of] anything on the Day of Resurrection, and because no soul shall speak except by His [Allaah’s] Leave. In the Muslim’s recitation of this <em>Aayah</em> in every <em>Rak’ah</em> of his prayers, there is a reminder for him of the Last Day, and an incitement to make himself ready by doing righteous deeds and refraining from sinful and evil acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</strong></span> }We solely single You out [O Allaah] with all acts of obedience and all worship, and to You alone we appeal for aid in all of our affairs, for indeed all the matters are in Your Hand, none [else] possess not even an ant’s weight of it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Aayah there is proof that it is not permissible for the ‘Abd [slaveworshipper of Allaah] to direct anything from the types of worship except to Allaah alone. In it there is a healing for the hearts from the ailment of devotion to other than Allaah, and from the diseases of Riyaa’ (showing off in good works), vanity, and arrogance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</strong></span> }Show us, guide us, and grant us the ability to purse the Straight Path and make us firmly established upon it until we meet You. The Straight Path is Islaam, the clear Way leading to attain the Pleasure of Allaah and His <em>Jannah</em> (Paradise), and which the end (last) of Allaah’s Messenger and Prophets [i.e. Muhammad(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)] directed us to it. There can be no way for the ‘<em>Abd</em> to attain happiness except by being upright on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. { <strong><span style="color:#008000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</span> </strong>}The Way of those upon whom You have conferred Your Favours of the Prophets, the <em>Siddeeqeen</em>,[2] the martyrs, and the righteous. Indeed, they are the ones worthy of guidance and who deserve to be rightly directed. And make us not of those who pursed the way of those who were the objects of Allaah’s Anger (<em>Al-Maghdoobi ‘Alayhim</em>), the Jews and likewise, who knew the truth but did not apply it; nor of those who have gone astray, the ones who were misguided and consequently have strayed away for the right path. These are <em>An-Nasaara</em> (the Christians) and whoever follows their way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this <em>du’aa</em> (invocation) there is a cure for the Muslim’s heart from the ailment of <em>Jahd</em> (knowingly denying the truth), ignorance, and misguidance, and a proof that the greatest favour at all is that of Islaam. So whoever is more knowledgeable of the truth and more pursuant of it is more entitled to the Straight Path. Without a doubt that among mankind, aside from the Prophets ‘<em>Alayhimus-Salaam</em>, the companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) have the best claim to this [Path]. Indeed, the <em>Aayah</em> proves their excellence and their great rank and standing, <em>Radiyallaahu ‘Anhum</em> (may Allaah be pleased with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is praiseworthy for the reader to say “<em>Aameen</em>” after the recitation of Al-Faatihah which means “O Allaah, respond.” It is not, however, an <em>Aayah</em> of Sooarat Al-Faatihah as this is agreed upon by the scholars. For this reason they unanimously agreed that it is not to be written in the copies (<em>Masaahif</em>, sing. <em>Mus&#8217;haf</em>) of the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave hoping for Allaah&#8217;s Mercy and Forgiveness<br />
Saleh As-Saleh, 1421 A.H<br />
Revised 3rd of Dhul Qi&#8217;dah, 1427, Nov. 24th 2006</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <em><strong>Rabb</strong></em>: Allaah is sole <em>Rabb</em>: He is the One Who gave all things the power to grow, to move and to change, to Whom belongs the Creation and Commandment; the Master Who has no equal in His Sovereignty, Predominance, and Highness, the One Who Provides for and Sustains all that exists, and who brings into existence things from nothing. The word “Lord” used in translating the word <em>Rabb</em> into the English Language, is not truly equivalent to the comprehensive meaning of the name <em>Ar-Rabb</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><strong>Siddeeqeen</strong> </em>(Sing. <em>Siddeeq</em>): One who eminently, or always, accepting, or confirming the truth in his saying, belief, and deeds. They are the followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, <em>Radiyallaahu ‘Anhu</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The author states: <b>&#8220;The Third Pillar:</b> Then there occurs the recitation of Surah Al-Faatihah, which is a pillar in every <i>rak’ah</i> (unit), as occurs in the hadeeth: <b>&#8216;There is no prayer for he who does not recite the opening (chapter) of the Book.&#8217;</b> It is the foundation of the Qur’aan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reciting Surah Al-Faatihah in every one of the <i>rak’aat</i> (units) of prayer is obligatory upon the one leading the prayer (Imaam), the one being led in prayer (<i>ma’moom</i>) and the one praying alone (<i>munfarid</i>). This is based on the Prophet’s statement (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“There is no prayer for he who does not recite the opening (chapter) of the Book.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (756) and Muslim (393)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one being led in prayer should recite it behind his Imaam in both the silent and audible prayers. What proves that it should be recited behind him in the audible prayers is the hadeeth in which a man from among the Prophet’s Companions reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Perhaps you recite behind the Imaam while the Imaam is reciting?”</b> They replied: “Yes, we do that.” He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Then do not do it, unless one of you is reciting the beginning (chapter) of the Book.”</b> Or he said: <b>“The Faatihah (opening chapter) of the Book.”</b> [Reported by Ahmad in his <i>Musnad</i> (18070) with an authentic chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Something similar to this has been reported by ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and in its chain of narration is Muhammad bin Ishaaq who narrated hadeeth explicitly which made his <i>tadlees</i> safe. It was reported by Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad</i> (22745).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way to combine between this report, the hadeeth that was reported about people refraining from reciting behind the Imaam, the hadeeth: <b>“Whoever has an Imaam, then his recitation serves as a recitation for him”</b>, and the hadeeth: <b>“When he recites, then remain silent” </b>is to understand all of these texts to refer to the recitation of any surah apart from Al-Faatihah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the author, may Allaah have mercy on him, goes on to provide a brief interpretation of (Surah) Al-Faatihah, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Bismillaah-ir-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem</i>”</b> (In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, Bestower of Mercy) is a request for blessing and assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by this is that a Muslim says Bismillaah seeking blessing from Allaah’s Name and seeking assistance in Allaah for his recitation. This applies also to anything for which he mentions Allaah’s Name prior to doing it. He is stating Allaah’s Name in order to seek blessing and assistance (by it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should recite the Bismillaah silently even though it is an ayah from the Qur’aan. Is it an ayah in every surah (chapter) or is it just an independent ayah used as a divider between surahs? And is it an ayah in Surah Al-Faatihah or is it not part of the surah at all? The scholars have many opinions on this. What indicates that it is part of the Qur’aan is that the Companions included it in the <i>mus-haf</i> and they didn’t include anything in there except for the Qur’aan. It is reported in the Sunan of Abu Dawood with an authentic chain (788) that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was not aware of the separation of a surah until <i>Bismillaah-ir-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem</i> was revealed to him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no disagreement amongst the scholars over the fact that the Bismillaah is part of an ayah within Surah An-Naml.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah Al-Faatihah consists of seven verses. Those scholars that believe that it is an ayah in Surah Al-Faatihah count the Bismillaah as being one of the seven verses. Those who believe that it is not part of Al-Faatihah make the seventh verse: <b>“Not of those who earned Your wrath nor of those who went astray.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the proofs that are used to indicate that the Bismillaah is not an ayah from Al-Faatihah is the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement in the qudsee hadeeth: <b>“I have divided the Prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, and My servant will have what he asks for. So when the servant says: ‘<i>Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabbil-‘Aalameen</i>’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has praised Me…’”</b> [Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) (395)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) did not mention the Bismillaah in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Al-Hamdulillaah</i>”</b> (All praise is for Allaah): <b>“<i>Hamd</i>”</b> means praise. The definite article (Al) before Hamd is for including all the commendable acts He does. As for the good things that one has no role in bringing about, such as beauty and so on, then praising that is called madah and not hamd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servants’ praising of their Lord is worship and it falls under Tawheed-ul-Uloohiyyah, which is the Oneness of Allaah in His servants actions (i.e. worship). Allaah is the One deserving of praise and commendation for every blessing that the servants achieve regardless if one of the servants played a part in it or not. This is since all of the credit in that matter belongs to Allaah, as He says: <b>“And whatever blessings you have, it is from Allaah.”</b>[Surah An-Nahl: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his advice to Ibn ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“And know that if the entire ummah were to gather together to bring you some benefit, they would not be able to benefit you except with something that Allaah has already decreed for you.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore all commendable acts in reality belong to Allaah. So He alone is the One who deserves praise in every circumstance. And as for the servants, whatever good things they do out of their own free will and choice, such as nobility, kindness and doing good deeds, then they should be praised and lauded for that. And whatever good that is in them, which they played no part in producing, such as beauty and good appearance, then they should be commended for it but not praised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Rabb-il-‘Aalameen</i>”</b> (Lord of all that is created): <b><i>Rabb</i></b> means the One who is worshipped, the Creator, the Sustainer, the King, the One who administers and brings up all of the creation through His favors. With regard to<b>‘<i>Aalameen</i></b>, everything that is apart from Allaah then that is considered <b>‘<i>Aalam</i></b>. He is the Lord of everyone and everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This consists of Oneness of Allaah in His Lordship, Names and Attributes since Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah means the Oneness of Allaah in His Actions. So He is One in His creating, sustaining, giving of life, and causing of death. He has no partners in His Lordship nor does He have any partner in His Worship. To Allaah belong the most perfect of Names and Attributes. Two of Allaah’s names have been mentioned in this ayah: <b>“All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all that is created.”</b> They are Allaah and Ar-Rabb. In another ayah, Allaah says: <b>“Salaam – a word from the Lord (Rabb), Most Merciful.”</b> [Surah YaaSeen: 58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Ar-Rahmaan</i>” </b>(The Most Merciful): means He grants a general mercy for all of the created beings. <b>“<i>Ar-Raheem</i>”</b> (The Bestower of Mercy): means He gives a specified mercy for just the believers. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: <b>“And He is ever an All-Bestower of mercy to the believers.”</b> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rahmaan and Ar-Raheem are two of Allaah’s names that indicate one of His Attributes, which is mercy. All of Allaah’s names are derivatives that indicate meanings, which are attributes. So an attribute from among His many Attributes can be extracted from every one of Allaah’s Names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Ar-Rahmaan is more general than Ar-Raheem and it cannot be applied to anyone except for Allaah. So it can’t be said to someone that he is Rahmaan. But as for Raheem, it can be applied to Allaah as well as others. Allaah said about His Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious over you. For the believers, he is full of pity, kind and merciful (<i>raheem</i>).”</b> [Surah At-Tawbah: 128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Maaliki-Yawm-id-Deen</i>”</b> (Master of the Day of Judgement): refers to the Day of Reward, Recompense and Accountability, the Day when everyone will be compensated for his deeds – if they are good, then there will be good (for him) and if they are evil, then there will be evil (for him). The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: <b>“And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? (It will be) The Day when no person shall have power (to do anything) for another, and the decision that Day will be wholly with Allaah.”</b> [Surah Al-Infitaar: 17-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“The shrewd person is the one who subjects himself and works for what comes after death. And the feeble person is the one who allows his soul to follow its vain desires, while aspiring for Allaah to grant his ambitions.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the Owner of everything. He is the Owner of the worldly life and the Hereafter. Allaah has only particularized the Day of Recompense here as Him being the Owner of it because it is the day in which all of the created beings will submit themselves to the Lord of all that exists. This is contrary to the worldly life for there can be found in it those who are insolent and haughty and who say such things as <b>“I am your lord, most high”</b> and<b>“I didn’t know you had a god besides me!”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth mentioned by the author was reported by At-Tirmidhee (2459) and its chain of narration contains Abu Bakr bin Abee Maryam who is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Iyyaaka Na’budu”</b> (You alone do we worship): meaning we don’t worship anyone except You. This is a covenant between the servant and his Lord that he will not worship anyone besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Wa Iyyaaka Nasta’een</i>”</b> (And in You alone do we seek assistance): This is a covenant between the servant and his Lord that he will not seek the assistance of anyone besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</b> [Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you place the object of the verb (You alone) before the verb (we worship) in issues of worship and seeking assistance, this indicates a limitation and particularization. So you are limiting the worship to only Allaah and particularizing Him alone by it. So no one is worshipped except Allaah and no one’s assistance is sought except for Allaah’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a servant (of Allaah) does not ask assistance from the angels or the jinn or anyone absent. But as for him asking assistance from a person that is present and who is able to assist him and help him achieve the benefit or repel the harm, this is permissible and not forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Ihdinaas-Siraat-al-Mustaqeem</i>”</b> (Guide us to the Straight Path) means direct us, show us the way and keep us firm on <b><i>as-Siraat</i></b> (the Path), meaning Islaam. It is also believed that it refers to the Messenger and likewise that it refers to the Qur’aan. All of these meanings are true. What is meant by <b><i>Mustaqeem</i></b> (Straight) is that which has no deviations in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people’s need for being guided to the Straight Path is greater than all of their other needs. And their requirement of it is above any other requirement they may have. Their need for it is greater than their need for food and drink since food and drink are only means for them to continue remaining in this worldly life. But as for their being guided to the Straight Path, then it is a cause for their success and happiness in both this worldly life and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asking to be guided to the Straight Path consists of requesting Allaah to direct and show you to the path of truth and guidance. It also entails asking Him to grant you the ability follow this Straight Path. When a servant asks his Lord in every <i>rak’ah</i> (unit) of the prayer to guide him to the Straight Path, this entails asking Him to keep him firm upon whatever he achieves from guidance. It also entails asking for an increased and additional guidance, as Allaah says: <b>“And as for those who are guided, He increases them in guidance and gives to them their Taqwaa (dutifulness).”</b> [Surah Muhammad: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction between interpreting <b>“Guide us”</b> to mean “show us, “direct us” or “keep us firm” nor with interpreting the <b>“Straight Path”</b> to mean “Islaam”, “the Messenger” or “the Qur’aan because that is only a difference of diversity and not a difference of contrast. This is why the author went on to say: “All of these meanings are true.” The interpretations of the Salaf are for the most part like this. Either their interpretation is by way of words that are close in meaning, which are all true and don’t contradict each other, as is the case here, or it is by way of example, which is done by interpreting a general word to mean some of the parts that fall under it, such as Allaah’s saying: <b>“Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 201]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction in interpreting the <b>“good”</b> of this world to mean a righteous wife or a righteous child or pure wealth. This falls under interpreting by way of example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>*****</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Siraat-aladheena An’amta ‘alayhim</i>”</b> (The Path of those You bestowed Your Favor on): meaning the way of those who have received your Bounty. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And whoever obeys Allaah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allaah has bestowed His Favor, such as the prophets, the first to believe (in the prophets), the martyrs and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Ghayr-il-Maghdoobi ‘alayhim</i>”</b> (Not those who earned Your Anger): They are the Jews since they have knowledge but do not act on it. You are asking Allaah to protect you from their way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<i>Wa laad-Daalleen</i>”</b> {Nor of those who went astray): This refers to the Christians, who worship Allaah based on ignorance and misguidance. You are asking Allaah to protect you from their way. The proof for those who went astray is Allaah’s saying: <b>“Say: Shall we inform you of the greatest losers with respect to their deeds? Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds.”</b> [Surah Al-Kahf: 103-105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is also the hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you, in exactly the same manner, to the point that if they were to enter the hole of a lizard, you would also enter it.”</b> They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and the Christians?” He said: <b>“Who else?”</b> Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim reported it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second hadeeth is: <b>“The Jews split up into seventy-one sects and the Christians split up into seventy-two sects. And this ummah (of Muslims) will split up into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hellfire except for one.”</b> They said: “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: <b>“Those who are upon the same way that I and my Companions are upon.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8212; the explanation &#8212;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Straight Path that a Muslim asks his Lord to guide him to is the path of those whom Allaah bestowed His Grace upon, such as the prophets, the siddeeqoon (first true believers), the martyrs and the righteous people, as Allaah says: <b>“And verily, this is my Straight Path, so follow it. And do not follow the other paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you so that you may become dutiful (Muttaqoon).”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asks Allaah in every one of the <i>rak’aat</i> (units) of his prayer to direct him to the path of truth and guidance and to protect him from the path of those who are astray and in error, such as the Jews and Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth: <b>“You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you…”</b> was reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7320) and Muslim (2669) from Abu Sa’eed. Its first part is found in <i>Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree</i> with the wording: <b>“You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you hand-span by hand-span and forearm by forearm…”</b> and in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> with the wording: <b>“You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you inch by inch and cubit by cubit.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth about the splitting of the ummah has been reported by a group of the Prophet’s Companions. For the referencing of this hadeeth, see the comments to hadeeth no. 16937 in the <i>Musnad</i> of Imaam Ahmad. Also see<i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</i> of Al-Albaanee (203-204) who quoted its authenticity on Ibn Taimiyyah, Ash-Shaatibee and Al-‘Iraaqee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the word <b>“ummah”</b> in this hadeeth is the ummah (nation of people) that have responded to the Call. These seventy-three sects are Muslims. The <b>“Saved Sect”</b> are those who are upon what the Prophet and his Companions were upon. Seventy-two of the sects are under the threat of being placed in the Hellfire due to their deviating from the path of truth. Their affair is up to Allaah – if He wishes, He will punish them and if He wishes, He will pardon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the ummah (nation of people) that requires the Call, they consist of every human being and Jinn from the time of the Prophet’s advent to the establishment of the Hour. Those who fall in this category are the Jews, the Christians and all of the other religions of disbelief. This is based on the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b>“By the One in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one from this ummah (nation of people) hears about me, whether he is a Jew or a Christian, then dies without believing in what I was sent with, except that he will be from the inhabitants of the Hellfire.”</b> [Reported by Muslim (386) from Abu Hurairah; Also see the Fataawaa of Shaikh-ul-Islaam (7/218) and <i>Fataawaa al-Lajnat-ud-Daa’imah</i> (2/157)]</p>

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Those who were well known for their Proficiency in Tafseer amongst the Taabi’een</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were many amongst the Taabi’een who became well known for their proficiency in Tafseer, amongst whom were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The People of Makkah: They are the followers of Ibn ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>), such as Mujaahid, ‘Ikrimah and ‘Ataa bin Abee Rabaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The People of Madeenah: They are the followers of Ubay bin Ka’ab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), such as Zayd bin Aslam, Abul-‘Aaliyah and Muhammad bin Ka’ab Al-Qurtubee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The People of Koofah (in ‘Iraq): They are the followers of Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), such as Qataadah, ‘Alqamah, and Ash-Sha’abee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will provide a biography of the lives of two of these individuals, namely Mujaahid and Qataadah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Mujaahid:</b><br />
He is Mujaahid bin Jabar al-Makkee, the freed slave of as-Saa’ib bin Abee as-Saa’ib al-Makhzoomee. He was born in 21H and learned the tafseer of the Qur’aan from Ibn ‘Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him. Ibn Ishaaq reported from him that he said: “I reviewed the entire <i>mus-haf</i>– from its beginning to its end – with Ibn ‘Abbaas on three separate occasions, stopping at each ayah and asking him about it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan Ath-Thawree said: “If the interpretation (of an ayah) comes to you from Mujaahid, then it is sufficient for you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi’ee relied on his tafseer (of the Qur’aan), as did Al-Bukhaaree who quoted often from him in his “Saheeh.” In the last part of his biography of him, Adh-Dhahabee said: “The ummah is in unanimous agreement that Mujaahid is an Imaam and that his tafseer is to be relied on as proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in Makkah while in the state of prostration in the year 104H at the age of 83.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Qataadah:</b><br />
He was Qataadah bin Di’amah as-Sudoosee al-Basree. He was born blind in the year 61H and strove hard in seeking knowledge. He had very strong memory. This was such that he said about himself: “I never told a Muhaddith (narrator of hadeeth): ‘Repeat that (hadeeth) to me again.’ Nor did my two ears hear anything ever, except that my heart retained it (in memory).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad mentioned him and spoke highly of him at great lengths. He would spread his knowledge and understanding of the differences of opinions and tafseer, and he described him as being strong in memory and possessing great understanding. He said about him: “Rarely do you find anybody placed before him.” And he said: “He is the best at memorizing from the people of Basrah. He did not hear anything except that he memorized it.” He died in the middle of the year 117H while 56 years old.</p>

<span style="color:#808080;">Source: Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 163-164)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Al-Ahdal said: “A summary of Tafseer Ibn Katheer can be found in the tafseer Fee Dhilaal-il-Qur’aan (of Sayyid Qutb).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer by Imam Muqbil (rahimahullaah):</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then let him bring us ten or twenty hadeeths with their <strong>chains of narration</strong> in the tafseer Adh-Dhilaal. Or let him bring us one example of where (Sayyid Qutb) declares <strong>a hadeeth authentic or weak</strong>! And let him show us where the ‘<strong>Aqeedah of the Salaf</strong> is in the tafseer, Adh-Dhilaal. Rather, the majority of what is in Adh-Dhilaal is from the (individual) <strong>ideologies of Sayyid Qutb</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for Tafseer Ibn Katheer,</strong></span> then Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His tafseer is from the best of tafseers, if not THE best.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyootee said in “Tabaqaat-ul-Huffaadh”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His tafseer is from the best of tafseers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has interpreted the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan, and he has interpreted the Qur’aan with the Sunnah. He has interpreted the Qur’aan with the statements of the Salaf, and he has interpreted the Qur’aan with the Arabic language. Then he authenticated and weakened (reports) and mentioned which ahaadeeth had no basis (i.e. source). And he refuted those who use some of these ahaadeeth as proof (for their views) by showing that they are not authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I remember when I was in Madeenah, one person, who was from the seniors amongst the Ikhwaan al-Mufliseen, told me that he advises the youth to read tafseer Adh-Dhilaal, and that it is better for them than Tafseer Ibn Katheer!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But these farces will soon die just as the books of <strong>Sa’eed Hawaa</strong>, which served the ideologies of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen, died. And the books of <strong>Salaah as-Saawee</strong>, which aid the ideologies of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen will soon die as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>‘Abdullaah bin Faysal Al-Ahdal</strong> will die (i.e. his da’wah) – the one who launches attacks against Ahlus-Sunnah. And we say to him: “Where is your attack against the Sufis, who have transgressed so much so that they supplicate and seek assistance from other than Allaah? Have you called the people to destroy and demolish the shrines (graves) in al-Hawta, and in al-‘Aynaat, and those which are in Shihr itself?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I must say: It is as if the Devil has deceived you. So it is as if you are prepared to (only) wage war against Ahlus-Sunnah. However, Ahlus-Sunnah give no importance to you. And if it were not that I were encouraged and requested by others to make a refutation against you, I would not have refuted you. This is since these words that come out from you are demented and have no worth whatsoever. So all praise be to Allaah, the Sunnah and good are both widespread. And the people do not look to and rely in (anyone) except Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So your words will only increase the people in their trust and reliance in the da’wah of Ahlus-Sunnah. One time, when the Communists were in ‘Aden, one person from the inhabitants of ‘Aden said to me: “We came to love you before we even saw you.” So it was said to him: “How is that so?” He responded: “Because the Communists used to say to us: ‘There exists a people in Sa’adah who go to their slaves from behind when they want to pray’, so we knew that the Communists did not speak against anyone except for righteous people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people know <strong>‘Abdullaah Al-Ahdal</strong> and what he is upon from deviation and misguidance, so his words only serve to aid the Sunnah…</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.060.001"></a>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said bin Al-Mu&#8217;alla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was praying in the Mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called me but I did not respond to him. Later I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say&#8217;&#8211;&#8220;Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you.&#8221; (8.24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said to me, &#8220;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Qur&#8217;an, before you leave the Mosque.&#8221; Then he got hold of my hand, and when he intended to leave (the Mosque), I said to him, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say to me, &#8216;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Quran?&#8217; He said, &#8220;Al-Hamdu-Lillah Rabbi-l-Alamin (i.e. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds) which is Al-Sab&#8217;a Al-Mathani (i.e. seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur&#8217;an which has been given to me.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Imam says: &#8216;Ghair-il-Maghdubi &#8216;Alaihim Walad-Dallin (i.e. not the path of those who earn Your Anger, nor the path of those who went astray (1.7)), then you must say, &#8216;Ameen&#8217;, for if one&#8217;s utterance of &#8216;Ameen&#8217; coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, &#8216;Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).&#8217; Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, &#8216;Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.&#8217; They will go to him and Noah will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, &#8216;Go to the Khalil&#8211;r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).&#8217; They will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .&#8217; So they will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s Slave, His Apostle and Allah&#8217;s Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord&#8217;s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.&#8217; (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, &#8216;None remains in Hell but those whom the Quran has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.&#8217; &#8221; (The compiler) Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;But those whom the Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned in Hell,&#8217; refers to the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They will dwell therein forever.&#8221; (16.29)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the greatest sin in the Sight of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;That you set up a rival unto Allah though He Alone created you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;That is indeed a great sin.&#8221; Then asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Kam&#8217;a (i.e. a kind of edible fungus) is like the Manna (in that it is obtained without effort) and its water is a (medicine) cure for eye trouble.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;It was said to the children of Israel, &#8216;Enter the gate (of the town), prostrate (in humility) and say: Hittatun (i.e. repentance) i.e. O Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forgive our sins.&#8217; But they entered by dragging themselves on their buttocks, so they did something different (from what they had been ordered to do) and said, &#8216;Hittatun,&#8217; but added, &#8220;A grain in a hair.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8220;Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Gabriel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission.&#8221; (2.97) Then he added, &#8220;As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.&#8221; On hearing that, &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.&#8221; In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, &#8220;What is &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s status amongst you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;May Allah protect him from this!&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah came out and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The Jews then said, &#8220;Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,&#8221; and disparaged him. On that &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, &#8220;Our best Qur&#8217;an reciter is Ubai and our best judge is &#8216;Ali; and in spite of this, we leave some of the statements of Ubai because Ubai says, &#8216;I do not leave anything that I have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle while Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whatever verse (Revelations) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We bring a better one or similar to it.&#8221; (2.106)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;The son of Adam tells a lie against me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is that he claims that I cannot recreate him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me, it is his statement that I have offspring. No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or offspring.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, &#8220;I agreed with Allah in three things,&#8221; or said, &#8220;My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.&#8217; I also said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.&#8217; So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, &#8216;You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.&#8217; When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle haven&#8217;t what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?&#8217; &#8221; Thereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah)..&#8221; (66.5)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that when your people built the Ka&#8217;ba, they did not build it on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were your people not so close to (the period of Heathenism, i.e. the Period between their being Muslims and being infidels), I would do so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Aisha had surely heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying that, for I do not think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle left touching the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka&#8217;ba was not built on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not believe the people of the Scripture or disbelieve them, but say:&#8211; &#8220;We believe in Allah and what is revealed to us.&#8221; (2.136)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). (So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered &#8216;Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, &#8220;I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.&#8221; Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka&#8217;ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8220;And Allah would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.&#8221; (2.143)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Noah will be called on the Day of Resurrection and he will say, &#8216;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik, O my Lord!&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Did you convey the Message?&#8217; Noah will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; His nation will then be asked, &#8216;Did he convey the Message to you?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No Warner came to us.&#8217; Then Allah will say (to Noah), &#8216;Who will bear witness in your favor?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Muhammad and his followers. So they (i.e. Muslims) will testify that he conveyed the Message. And the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah &#8220;Thus We have made of you a just and the best nation that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While some people were offering Fajr prayer in the Quba&#8217; mosque, some-one came and said, &#8220;Allah has revealed to the Prophet Qur&#8217;anic instructions that you should face the Ka&#8217;ba (while praying) so you too, should face it.&#8221; Those people then turned towards the Ka&#8217;ba.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While some people were offering morning prayer at Quba&#8217; a man came to them and said, &#8220;A Quranic Order has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle tonight that he should face the Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca (in prayer), so you too should turn your faces towards it.&#8221; At that moment their faces were towards Sham (i.e. Jerusalem) (and on hearing that) they turned towards the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While some people were offering Fajr prayer at Quba&#8217; (mosque), some-one came to them and said, &#8220;Tonight some Qur&#8217;anic Verses have been revealed to the Prophet and he has been ordered to face the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca) (during prayers), so you too should turn your faces towards it.&#8221; At that time their faces were towards Sham (Jerusalem) so they turned towards the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We prayed along with the Prophet facing Jerusalem for sixteen or seventeen months. Then Allah ordered him to turn his face towards the Qibla (in Mecca):&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from whence-so-ever you start forth (for prayers) turn your face in the direction of (the Sacred Mosque of Mecca) Al-Masjid-ul Haram..&#8221; (2.149)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 20:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While some people were at Quba (offering) morning prayer, a man came to them and said, &#8220;Last night Quranic Verses have been revealed whereby the Prophet has been ordered to face the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca), so you too should face it.&#8221; So they, keeping their postures, turned towards the Ka&#8217;ba. Formerly the people were facing Sham (Jerusalem) (Allah said):&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from whence-so-ever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque of Mecca (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram), and whence-so-ever you are, turn your face towards it (when you pray)&#8221; (2.150)</p>

Their faces were then towards Sham (Jerusalem), so they turned towards the Qibla (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba of Mecca).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 22:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, and I was at that time a young boy, &#8220;How do you interpret the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj to the House of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them. In my opinion it is not sinful for one not to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Your interpretation is wrong for as you say, the Verse should have been: &#8220;So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj or Umra to the House, not to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.&#8217; This Verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who (during the Pre-Islamic Period) used to visit Manat (i.e. an idol) after assuming their Ihram, and it was situated near Qudaid (i.e. a place at Mecca), and they used to regard it sinful to ambulate between Safa and Marwa after embracing Islam. When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, whereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asim bin Sulaiman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas bin Malik about Safa and Marwa. Anas replied, &#8220;We used to consider (i.e. going around) them a custom of the Pre-islamic period of Ignorance, so when Islam came, we gave up going around them. Then Allah revealed&#8221; &#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Allah) or perform the Umra to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 24:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said one statement and I said another. The Prophet said &#8220;Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allah as a rival to Allah, will enter Hell (Fire).&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Whoever dies without invoking anything as a rival to Allah, will enter Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 25:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The law of Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) was prescribed for the children of Israel, but the Diya (i.e. blood money was not ordained for them). So Allah said to this Nation (i.e. Muslims):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! The law of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in cases of murder: The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if the relatives (or one of them) of the killed (person) forgive their brother (i.e. the killers something of Qisas (i.e. not to kill the killer by accepting blood money in the case of intentional murder)&#8212;-then the relatives (of the killed person) should demand blood-money in a reasonable manner and the killer must pay with handsome gratitude. This is an allevitation and a Mercy from your Lord, (in comparison to what was prescribed for the nations before you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after this, whoever transgresses the limits (i.e. to kill the killer after taking the blood-money) shall have a painful torment.&#8221; (2.178)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his aunt, Ar-Rubai&#8217; broke an incisor tooth of a girl. My aunt&#8217;s family requested the girl&#8217;s relatives for forgiveness but they refused; then they proposed a compensation, but they refused. Then they went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and refused everything except Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed the judgment of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality of punishment). Anas bin Al-Nadr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will the incisor tooth of Ar-Rubai be broken? No, by Him Who sent you with the Truth, her incisor tooth will not be broken.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Anas! The prescribed law of Allah is equality in punishment (i.e. Al-Qisas.)&#8221; Thereupon those people became satisfied and forgave her. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Among Allah&#8217;s Worshippers there are some who, if they took Allah&#8217;s Oath (for something), Allah fulfill their oaths.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting was observed on the day of &#8216;Ashura&#8217; (i.e. 10th of Muharram) by the people of the Pre-lslamic Period. But when (the order of compulsory fasting) in the month of Ramadan was revealed, the Prophet said, &#8220;It is up to one to fast on it (i.e. day of &#8216;Ashura&#8217;) or not.&#8221;</p>

Al-Ash&#8217;ath said, &#8220;Today is &#8216;Ashura.&#8221; I said (to him), &#8220;Fasting had been observed (on such a day) before (the order of compulsory fasting in) Ramadan was revealed.

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance the Quraish used to observe fasting on the day of &#8216;Ashura&#8217;, and the Prophet himself used to observe fasting on it too. But when he came to Medina, he fasted on that day and ordered the Muslims to fast on it. When (the order of compulsory fasting in ) Ramadan was revealed, fasting in Ramadan became an obligation, and fasting on &#8216;Ashura&#8217; was given up, and who ever wished to fast (on it) did so, and whoever did not wish to fast on it, did not fast.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And for those who can fast they had a choice either fast, or feed a poor for every day..&#8221; (2.184) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse is not abrogated, but it is meant for old men and old women who have no strength to fast, so they should feed one poor person for each day of fasting (instead of fasting).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Adi took a white rope (or thread) and a black one, and when some part of the night had passed, he looked at them but he could not distinguish one from the other. The next morning he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I put (a white thread and a black thread) underneath my pillow.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then your pillow is too wide if the white thread (of dawn) and the black thread (of the night) are underneath your pillow! &#8220;</p>

Then Allah revealed&#8217; &#8230; of dawn,&#8217; whereupon they understood that meant the night and the day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Pre-lslamic Period when the people assumed Ihram, they would enter their houses from the back. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And it is not righteousness that you enter houses from the back, but the righteous man is he who fears Allah, obeys His Orders and keeps away from what He has forbidden. So enter houses through their doors.&#8221; (2.189)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the affliction of Ibn Az-Zubair, two men came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;The people are lost, and you are the son of &#8216;Umar, and the companion of the Prophet, so what forbids you from coming out?&#8221; He said, &#8220;What forbids me is that Allah has prohibited the shedding of my brother&#8217;s blood.&#8221; They both said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say, &#8216;And fight then until there is no more affliction?&#8221; He said &#8220;We fought until there was no more affliction and the worship is for Allah (Alone while you want to fight until there is affliction and until the worship become for other than Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi (through another group of sub-narrators): A man came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur Rahman! What made you perform Hajj in one year and Umra in another year and leave the Jihad for Allah&#8217; Cause though you know how much Allah recommends it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Islam is founded on five principles, i.e. believe in Allah and His Apostle, the five compulsory prayers, the fasting of the month of Ramadan, the payment of Zakat, and the Hajj to the House (of Allah).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur Rahman! Won&#8217;t you listen to why Allah has mentioned in His Book: &#8216;If two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them, but if one of then transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then you all fight against the one that transgresses. (49.9) and:&#8211;&#8220;And fight them till there is no more affliction (i.e. no more worshiping of others along with Allah).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did it, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when Islam had only a few followers. A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured. But when the Muslims increased, there was no more afflictions or oppressions.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is your opinion about &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Uthman, it seems that Allah has forgiven him, but you people dislike that he should be forgiven. And as for &#8216;Ali, he is the cousin of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his son-in-law.&#8221; Then he pointed with his hand and said, &#8220;That is his house which you see.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And spend (of your wealth) in the Cause of Allah and do not throw yourselves in destruction,&#8221; (2.195) was revealed concerning spending in Allah&#8217;s Cause (i.e. Jihad).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maqal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin Ujra in this mosque, i.e. Kufa Mosque, and asked him about the meaning of:&#8211;&#8220;Pay a ransom (i.e. Fidya) of either fasting or &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; (2.196) He said, &#8220;I was taken to the Prophet while lice were falling on my face. The Prophet said, &#8216;I did not think that your trouble reached to such an extent. Can you afford to slaughter a sheep (as a ransom for shaving your head)?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then fast for three days, or feed six poor persons by giving half a Sa of food for each and shave your head.&#8217; So the above Verse was revealed especially for me and generally for all of you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Verse of Hajj-at-Tamatu was revealed in Allah&#8217;s Book, so we performed it with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and nothing was revealed in Qur&#8217;an to make it illegal, nor did the Prophet prohibit it till he died.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ukaz, Mijanna and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the Pre-islamic Period. They (i.e. Muslims) considered it a sin to trade there during the Hajj time (i.e. season), so this Verse was revealed:&#8211; &#8220;There is no harm for you if you seek of the Bounty of your Lord during the Hajj season.&#8221; (2.198)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish people and those who embraced their religion, used to stay at Muzdalifa and used to call themselves Al-Hums, while the rest of the Arabs used to stay at &#8216;Arafat. When Islam came, Allah ordered His Prophet to go to &#8216;Arafat and stay at it, and then pass on from there, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah:&#8211;&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; (2.199)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man who wants to perform the Hajj (from Mecca) can perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba as long as he is not in the state of Ihram till he assumes the Ihram for Hajj. Then, if he rides and proceeds to &#8216;Arafat, he should take a Hadi (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of &#8216;Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of &#8216;Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to &#8216;Arafat and stay there from the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from &#8216;Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam&#8217; (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Allah to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Allah greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Allah is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Allah said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8220;(Respite will be granted) until when the Apostles gave up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people). There came to them Our Help &#8230;.&#8221; (12.110) reading Kudhibu without doubling the sound &#8216;dh&#8217;, and that was what he understood of the Verse. Then he went on reciting: &#8220;..even the Apostle and those who believed along with him said: When (will come) Allah&#8217;s Help? Yes, verily, Allah&#8217;s Help is near.&#8221; (2.214)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I met &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;Aisha said, &#8216;Allah forbid! By Allah, Allah never promised His Apostle anything but he knew that it would certainly happen before he died. But trials were continuously presented before the Apostles till they were afraid that their followers would accuse them of telling lies. So I used to recite:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Till they (come to) think that they were treated as liars.&#8221; reading &#8216;Kudh-dhibu with double &#8216;dh.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Ibn &#8216;Umar recited the Qur&#8217;an, he would not speak to anyone till he had finished his recitation. Once I held the Qur&#8217;an and he recited Surat-al-Baqara from his memory and then stopped at a certain Verse and said, &#8220;Do you know in what connection this Verse was revealed? &#8221; I replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was revealed in such-and-such connection.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then resumed his recitation. Nafi added regarding the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;So go to your tilth when or how you will&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It means one should approach his wife in ..&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews used to say: &#8220;If one has sexual intercourse with his wife from the back, then she will deliver a squint-eyed child.&#8221; So this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Your wives are a tilth unto you; so go to your tilth when or how you will.&#8221; (2.223)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The sister of Ma&#8217;qal bin Yasar was divorced by her husband who left her till she had fulfilled her term of &#8216;Iddat (i.e. the period which should elapse before she can Remarry) and then he wanted to remarry her but Maqal refused, so this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.&#8221; (2.232)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 53:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan (while he was collecting the Qur&#8217;an) regarding the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives &#8230;&#8221; (2.240) &#8220;This Verse was abrogated by an other Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur&#8217;an)?&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said. &#8220;O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 54:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding the Verse):&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They &#8211; (their wives) &#8212; shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days).&#8221; (2.234)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband&#8217;s family, so Allah revealed: &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year&#8217;s maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.&#8217; (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband&#8217;s home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you.&#8221; So the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata said: Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: &#8220;..without turning them out..&#8221; cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband&#8217;s house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217;s aid: If she wished, she could complete her &#8216;Idda by staying in her dead husband&#8217;s residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah&#8217;s Statement:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband&#8217;s house), so she could complete the &#8216;Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow&#8217;s) dwelling in her dead husband&#8217;s house and she could complete the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Allah&#8217;s Statement says:&#8211;&#8220;&#8230;without turning them out&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat in a gathering in which the chiefs of the Ansar were present, and Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Laila was amongst them. I mentioned the narration of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Utba regarding the question of Subai&#8217;a bint Al-Harith. Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;But &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s uncle used not to say so.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa,&#8221; and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin &#8216;Amir or Malik bin &#8216;Auf, and said, &#8220;What was the verdict of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said, &#8216;Why do you impose on her the hard order and don&#8217;t let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at-Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara).&#8221; (i.e. Her &#8216;Idda is up till she delivers.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Arqam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to speak while in prayer. One of us used to speak to his brother (while in prayer) about his need, till the Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Guard strictly the (five obligatory) prayers, especially the middle (the Best) (Asr) Prayer and stand before Allah with obedience (and not to speak to others during the prayers).&#8221; Then we were ordered not to speak in the prayers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 59:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. prayer of fear) he said, &#8220;The Imam comes forward with a group of people and leads them in a one Rak&#8217;a prayer while another group from them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one Rak&#8217;a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a Rak&#8217;a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two Rakat, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second Rak&#8217;a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two Rakat. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not.&#8221; Nafi added: I do not think that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar narrated this except from Allah&#8217;s Apostle (See Hadith No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly &#8220;The Fear Prayer.&#8221;)</p>

I have something in my mind to say about it.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother!

So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the Truth ). follow thereof that is not entirely clear seeking affliction and searching for its hidden meanings; but no one knows its hidden meanings but Allah.

Those who Purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter&#8230;&#8221; (3.77) Then entered Al-Ash&#8217;ath bin Qais and said, &#8220;What is Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman narrating to you?&#8221; We replied, &#8216;So-and-so.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath said, &#8220;This Verse was revealed in my connection. I had a well in the land of my cousin (and he denied my, possessing it). On that the Prophet said to me, &#8216;Either you bring forward a proof or he (i.e. your cousin) takes an oath (to confirm his claim)&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am sure he would take a (false) oath, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; He said, &#8216;If somebody takes an oath when asked to do so through which he may deprive a Muslim of his property (unlawfully) and he is a liar in his oath, he will meet Allah Who will be angry with him.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 75:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan narrated to me personally, saying, &#8220;I set out during the Truce that had been concluded between me and Allah&#8217;s Apostle. While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, &#8216;Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, &#8216;Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). &#8216;Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan&#8217;s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).&#8217; By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, &#8216;Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) family status amongst you? I said, &#8216;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&#8221; Heraclius said, &#8216;Was any of his ancestors a king?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?&#8217; I said, &#8216;It is the poor who followed him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you fight with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;How was your fighting with him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did he ever betray?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, &#8216;Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), &#8216;I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.&#8221; Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Heraclius then asked me, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.&#8217; Then Heraclius said, &#8216;If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.&#8217; Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and read it wherein was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine&#8230;&#8230;.. Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Allah&#8217;s Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Allah&#8217;s Statement):&#8211;&#8220;O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but Allah&#8230;.bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8217; (3.64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;While coming out, I said to my companions, &#8216;The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.&#8217; So I continued to believe that Allah&#8217;s Apostle would be victorious, till Allah made me embrace Islam.&#8221; Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, &#8216;O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?&#8217; (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, &#8216;Bring them back to me.&#8217; So he called them and said, &#8216;I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.&#8217; Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Out of all the Ansar, living in Medina, Abu Talha had the largest number of (date palm trees) gardens, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was standing opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good water. When the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) Abu Talha got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Allah says:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) and the most beloved of my property to me is the Bairuha garden, so I give it (as a charitable gift) in Allah&#8217;s Cause and hope to receive good out of it, and to have it stored for me with Allah. So, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Dispose it of (i.e. utilize it) in the way Allah orders you (to dispose it of).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Bravo! That is a fruitful property! That is a fruitful property! I have heard what you have said and I think that you should distribute that (garden) amongst your relatives.&#8221; The Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews brought to the Prophet a man and a woman from among them who had committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;How do you usually punish the one amongst you who has committed illegal sexual intercourse?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We blacken their faces with coal and beat them,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you find the order of Ar-Rajm (i.e. stoning to death) in the Torah?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We do not find anything in it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam (after hearing this conversation) said to them. &#8220;You have told a lie! Bring here the Torah and recite it if you are truthful.&#8221; (So the Jews brought the Torah). And the religious teacher who was teaching it to them, put his hand over the Verse of Ar-Rajm and started reading what was written above and below the place hidden with his hand, but he did not read the Verse of Ar-Rajm. &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam removed his (i.e. the teacher&#8217;s) hand from the Verse of Ar-Rajm and said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; So when the Jews saw that Verse, they said, &#8220;This is the Verse of Ar-Rajm.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered the two adulterers to be stoned to death, and they were stoned to death near the place where biers used to be placed near the Mosque. I saw her companion (i.e. the adulterer) bowing over her so as to protect her from the stones.</p>

Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham, and &#8216;Aiyash bin Abu Rabi&#8217;a. O Allah! Inflict Your Severe Torture on Mudar (tribe) and strike them with (famine) years like the years of Joseph.&#8221; The Prophet used to say in a loud voice, and he also used to say in some of his Fajr prayers, &#8220;O Allah! Curse so-and-so and so-and-so.&#8221; naming some of the Arab tribes till Allah revealed:&#8211;&#8220;Not for you (O Muhammad) (but for Allah) is the decision.&#8221; (3.128)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair as the commander of the infantry during the battle of Uhud. They returned defeated, and that is what is meant by:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the Apostle was calling them back in the rear. None remained with the Prophet then, but twelve men.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Allah is Sufficient for us and He Is the Best Disposer of affairs,&#8221; was said by Abraham when he was thrown into the fire; and it was said by Muhammad when they (i.e. hypocrites) said, &#8220;A great army is gathering against you, therefore, fear them,&#8221; but it only increased their faith and they said: &#8220;Allah is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer (of affairs, for us).&#8221; (3.173)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 88:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Anyone whom Allah has given wealth but he does not pay its Zakat, then, on the Day of Resurrection, his wealth will be presented to him in the shape of a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two poisonous glands in its mouth and it will encircle itself round his neck and bite him over his cheeks and say, &#8220;I am your wealth; I am your treasure.&#8221; Then the Prophet recited this Divine Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And let not those who covetously withhold of that which Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty.&#8221; (3.180)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 89:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Saluil said, &#8220;O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, &#8220;Did you not hear what &#8216;Abu Hub-b said?&#8221; He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai. &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; On that Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who revealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head (electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Allah gave to you, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have seen.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief with patience. Allah said: &#8220;And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and from the pagans&#8230;&#8230;..'(3.186) And Allah also said:&#8211;&#8220;Many of the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy..&#8221; (2.109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted fighting them. So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious).&#8221; So they gave the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, some men among the hypocrites used to remain behind him (i.e. did not accompany him) when he went out for a Ghazwa and they would be pleased to stay at home behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned (from the battle) they would put forward (false) excuses and take oaths, wishing to be praised for what they had not done. So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done..&#8221; (3.188)</p>

It was only that the Prophet called the Jews and asked them about something, and they hid the truth and told him something else, and showed him that they deserved praise for the favor of telling him the answer to his question, and they became happy with what they had concealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Abbas recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;(And remember) when Allah took a Covenant from those who were given the Scripture..and those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done.&#8217; &#8221; (3.187-188)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! In the creation of the Heavens and the Earth and in the alteration of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.&#8221; (3.190)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood up, performed ablution, brushed his teeth with a Siwak, and then prayed eleven Rakat. Then Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call for the Fajr prayer).

He then performed the ablution from it, and it was perfect ablution, and then stood up to offer the prayer. I too did the same as he had done, and then went to stand beside him.

He then offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat. then two Rakat, and finally one Rak&#8217;a, the Witr.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was an orphan (girl) under the care of a man. He married her and she owned a date palm (garden). He married her just because of that and not because he loved her. So the Divine Verse came regarding his case: &#8220;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls&#8230;&#8221; (4.3) The sub-narrator added: I think he (i.e. another sub-narrator) said, &#8220;That orphan girl was his partner in that datepalm (garden) and in his property.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he asked &#8216;Aisha regarding the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls&#8230;&#8221; (4.3) She said, &#8220;O son of my sister! An Orphan girl used to be under the care of a guardian with whom she shared property. Her guardian, being attracted by her wealth and beauty, would intend to marry her without giving her a just Mahr, i.e. the same Mahr as any other person might give her (in case he married her). So such guardians were forbidden to do that unless they did justice to their female wards and gave them the highest Mahr their peers might get. They were ordered (by Allah, to marry women of their choice other than those orphan girls.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added,&#8221; The people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle his instructions after the revelation of this Divine Verse whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They ask your instruction regarding women &#8221; (4.127) &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And yet whom you desire to marry.&#8221; (4.127) as anyone of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl (under his guardianship) when she is lacking in property and beauty.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;So they were forbidden to marry those orphan girls for whose wealth and beauty they had a desire unless with justice, and that was because they would refrain from marrying them if they were lacking in property and beauty.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And whoever amongst the guardian is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his work). This Verse was revealed regarding the orphan&#8217;s property. If the guardian is poor, he can take from the property of the orphan, what is just and reasonable according to his work and the time he spends on managing it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ikrama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said ( regarding the verse), &#8220;And when the relatives and the orphans and the poor are present at the time of division, &#8220;this verse and its order is valid and not abrogated.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and Abu Bakr came on foot to pay me a visit (during my illness) at Banu Salama&#8217;s (dwellings). The Prophet found me unconscious, so he asked for water and performed the ablution from it and sprinkled some water over it. I came to my senses and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order me to do as regards my wealth?&#8221; So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah commands you as regards your children&#8217;s (inheritance):&#8221; (4.11)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Pre-Islamic Period ) the children used to inherit all the property but the parents used to inherit only through a will. So Allah cancelled that which He liked to cancel and put decreed that the share of a son was to be twice the share of a daughter, and for the parents one-sixth for each one of them, or one third, and for the wife one-eighth or one-fourth, and for the husband one-half, or one-fourth.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Divine Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them.&#8221; (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Verse: &#8220;To everyone, We have appointed heirs.&#8221; (4.33) &#8216;Mawali&#8217; means heirs. And regarding:&#8211; &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Emigrants came to Medina, an Emigrant used to be the heir of an Ansari with the exclusion of the latter&#8217;s relatives, and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had established between them (i.e. the Emigrants and the Ansar). So when the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;To everyone We have appointed heirs.&#8221; was revealed, (the inheritance through bond of brotherhood) was cancelled. Ibn Abbas then said: &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221; is concerned with the covenant of helping and advising each other. So allies are no longer to be the heir of each other, but they can bequeath each other some of their property by means of a will.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet some people said, : O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, &#8220;Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.&#8221; Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.&#8217; They will be directed and addressed thus, &#8216;Will you drink,&#8217; whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;What do you want?&#8217; They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, &#8216;What are you waiting for?&#8217; Every nation have followed what they used to worship.&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say twice or thrice, &#8216;We do not worship any besides Allah.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Irrigate (your lands and the let the water flow to your neighbor The Ansar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (This is because) he (Zubair) is your cousin?&#8221; At that, the Prophet&#8217;s face became red (with anger) and he said &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it fills the land up to the walls and then let it flow to your neighbor.&#8221; So the Prophet enabled Az-Zubair to take his full right after the Ansari provoked his anger. The Prophet had previously given a order that was in favor of both of them Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think but the Verse was revealed in this connection: &#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.6)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Kufa disagreed (disputed) about the above Verse. So I went to Ibn Abbas and asked him about it. He said, &#8220;This Verse:&#8211; &#8220;And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell.&#8221; was revealed last of all (concerning premeditated murder) and nothing abrogated it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Verse: &#8220;And say not to anyone who offers you peace (by accepting Islam), You are not a believer.&#8221; There was a man amidst his sheep. The Muslims pursued him, and he said (to them) &#8220;Peace be on you.&#8221; But they killed him and took over his sheep. Thereupon Allah revealed in that concern, the above Verse up to:&#8211; &#8220;&#8230;seeking the perishable good of this life.&#8221; (4.94) i.e. those sheep.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 116:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: That the Prophet dictated to him: &#8220;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid added: Ibn Um Maktum came while the Prophet was dictating to me and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, if I had the power to fight (in Allah&#8217;s Cause), I would,&#8221; and he was a blind man. So Allah revealed to his Apostle while his thigh was on my thigh, and his thigh became so heavy that I was afraid it might fracture my thigh. Then that state of the Prophet passed and Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8220;Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)&#8221; (4.95) was revealed, Allah Apostle called for Zaid who wrote it. In the meantime Ibn Um Maktum came and complained of his blindness, so Allah revealed: &#8220;Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame&#8230;&#8221; etc.) (4.95)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home),&#8221; (4.95) was revealed, the Prophet said, &#8220;Call so-and-so.&#8221; That person came to him with an ink-pot and a wooden board or a shoulder scapula bone. The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Write: &#8216;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.&#8221; Ibn Um Maktum who was sitting behind the Prophet then said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a blind man.&#8221; So there was revealed in the place of that Verse, the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury, or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.&#8221; (4.95)</p>

An arrow used to be shot which would hit one of them (the Muslims in the company of the pagans) and kill him, or he would be struck and killed (with a sword).&#8221; Then Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers)&#8221; (4.97) Abu Aswad added, &#8220;Except the weak ones among men, women,&#8230;&#8221; (4.98)</p>

O Allah, save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah, save Al-Walid bin Al-Wahd. O Allah, save the weak ones among the believers. O Allah, let Your punishment be severe on the tribe of Mudar.

Say: Allah instructs you about them and yet whom you desire to marry.&#8221; (4.127) (has been revealed regarding the case of) a man who has an orphan girl, and he is her guardian and her heir. The girl shares with him all his property, even a date-palm (garden), but he dislikes to marry her and dislikes to give her in marriage to somebody else who would share with him the property she is sharing with him, and for this reason that guardian prevents that orphan girl from marrying. So, this Verse was revealed: (And Allah&#8217;s statement:) &#8220;If a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband&#8217;s part.&#8221; (4.128)</p>

Allah says: &#8220;Verily! The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire.&#8221; (4.145)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that &#8216;Abdullah smiled and Hudhaifa sat somewhere in the Mosque. &#8216;Abdullah then got up and his companions (sitting around him) dispersed. Hudhaifa then threw a pebble at me (to attract my attention). I went to him and he said, &#8220;I was surprised at &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s smile though he understood what I said.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed there to look for it, and so did the people along with him. Neither were they at a place of water, nor did they have any water with them. So the people went to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people, stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.&#8221; Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He said (to me), &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people where there is no water, and they have no water with them.&#8221; So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say, and he hit me on my flanks with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain! but the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my thigh. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water, so Allah revealed the Verse of Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;It is not the first blessing of yours, O the family of Abu Bakr.&#8221; Then we made the camel on which I was riding, got up, and found the necklace under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A necklace of mine was lost at Al-Baida&#8217; and we were on our way to Medina. The Prophet made his camel kneel down and dismounted and laid his head on my lap and slept. Abu Bakr came to me and hit me violently on the chest and said, &#8220;You have detained the people because of a necklace.&#8221; I kept as motionless as a dead person because of the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ; (on my lap) although Abu Bakr had hurt me (with the slap). Then the Prophet woke up and it was the time for the morning (prayer). Water was sought, but in vain; so the following Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When you intend to offer prayer..&#8221; (5.6) Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;Allah has blessed the people for your sake, O the family of Abu Bakr. You are but a blessing for them.&#8221;</p>

So take them out and drink of their milk and urine.&#8217; So they took them and set out and drank of their urine and milk, and having recovered, they attacked the shepherd, killed him and drove away the camels.&#8217; Why should there be any delay in punishing them as they murdered (a person) and waged war against Allah and His Apostle and frightened Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; Anbasa said, &#8220;I testify the uniqueness of Allah!&#8221; Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Do you suspect me?&#8221; &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, Anas narrated that (Hadith) to us.&#8221; Then &#8216;Anbasa added, &#8220;O the people of such-and-such (country), you will remain in good state as long as Allah keeps this (man) and the like of this (man) amongst you.&#8221;</p>

People (in the Pre-lslamic periods of ignorance) used to let that she camel loose for their idols if it gave birth to two she-camels successively without giving birth to a male camel in between. &#8216;Ham&#8217; was the male camel which was used for copulation. When it had finished the number of copulations assigned for it, they would let it loose for their idols and excuse it from burdens so that nothing would be carried on it, and they called it the &#8216;Hami.&#8217; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying so.&#8221;</p>

(They are) my companions!&#8217; Then a reply will come (from Almighty), &#8216;You do not know what they did after you.&#8217; I will say as the pious slave (the Prophet Jesus) said: And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them. When You took me up.

So Abu Bakr went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while we were with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This friend of yours must have quarrelled (with somebody).&#8221; In the meantime &#8216;Umar repented and felt sorry for what he had done, so he came, greeted (those who were present) and sat with the Prophet and related the story to him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle became angry and Abu Bakr started saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I was more at fault (than Umar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Are you (people) leaving for me my companion? (Abu Bakr), Are you (people) leaving for me my companion?

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa came and stayed with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais who was one of those whom &#8216;Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra&#8217; (learned men knowing Qur&#8217;an by heart) were the people of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. &#8216;Uyaina said to his nephew, &#8220;O son of my brother! You have an approach to this chief, so get for me the permission to see him.&#8221; Al-Hurr said, &#8220;I will get the permission for you to see him.&#8221; So Al-Hurr asked the permission for &#8216;Uyaina and &#8216;Umar admitted him. When &#8216;Uyaina entered upon him, he said, &#8220;Beware! O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.&#8221; Thereupon &#8216;Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him, but Al-Hurr said, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Allah said to His Prophet: &#8220;Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; and leave (don&#8217;t punish) the foolish.&#8221; (7.199) and this (i.e. &#8216;Uyaina) is one of the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him; he observed (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And if two groups of believers fight against each other&#8230;&#8217; (49.9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what prevents you from fighting as Allah has mentioned in His Book?&#8221;&#8216; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! I would rather be blamed for not fighting because of this Verse than to be blamed because of another Verse where Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And whoever kills a believer intentionally&#8230;&#8221; (4.93) Then that man said, &#8220;Allah says:&#8211; &#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (worshipping other besides Allah) and the religion (i.e. worship) will be all for Allah (Alone)&#8221; (8.39) Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did this during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when the number of Muslims was small, and a man was put to trial because of his religion, the pagans would either kill or chain him; but when the Muslims increased (and Islam spread), there was no persecution.&#8221; When that man saw that Ibn &#8216;Umar did not agree to his proposal, he said, &#8220;What is your opinion regarding &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Uthman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What is my opinion regarding Ali and &#8216;Uthman?

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;If there are twenty steadfast amongst you, they will overcome two hundred.&#8221; (8.65) was revealed, then it became obligatory for the Muslims that one (Muslim) should not flee from ten (non-Muslims). Sufyan (the sub-narrator) once said, &#8220;Twenty (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non Muslims).&#8221; Then there was revealed: &#8216;But now Allah has lightened your (task)..&#8217; (8.66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it became obligatory that one-hundred (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non-muslims). (Once Sufyan said extra, &#8220;The Verse: &#8216;Urge the believers to the fight. If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims) ..&#8217; was revealed.)

So (Allah) lightened the order by revealing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;(But) now Allah has lightened your (task) for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are of you one-hundred steadfast, they will overcome (two-hundred (non-Muslims).&#8217; (8.66) So when Allah reduced the number of enemies which Muslims should withstand, their patience and perseverance against the enemy decreased as much as their task was lightened for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I passed by (visited ) Abu Dhar at Ar-Rabadha and said to him, &#8220;What has brought you to this land?&#8221; He said, &#8220;We were at Sham and I recited the Verse: &#8220;They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah; announce to them a painful torment, &#8221; (9.34) where upon Muawiya said, &#8216;This Verse is not for us, but for the people of the Scripture.&#8217; Then I said, &#8216;But it is both for us (Muslim) and for them.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth; the year is twelve months, four of which are sacred. Three of them are in succession; Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Al-Muharram, and (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar (named after the tribe of Mudar as they used to respect this month) which stands between Jumad (ath-thani) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was in the company of the Prophet in the cave, and on seeing the traces of the pagans, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle If one of them (pagans) should lift up his foot, he will see us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What do you think of two, the third of whom is Allah?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there happened the disagreement between Ibn Az-Zubair and Ibn &#8216;Abbas, I said (to the latter), &#8220;(Why don&#8217;t you take the oath of allegiance to him as) his father is Az-Zubair, and his mother is Asma,&#8217; and his aunt is &#8216;Aisha, and his maternal grandfather is Abu Bakr, and his grandmother is Safiya?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 187:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a disagreement between them (i.e. Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Ibn Az-Zubair) so I went to Ibn &#8216;Abbas in the morning and said (to him), &#8220;Do you want to fight against Ibn Zubair and thus make lawful what Allah has made unlawful (i.e. fighting in Meccas?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah forbid! Allah ordained that Ibn Zubair and Bani Umaiya would permit (fighting in Mecca), but by Allah, I will never regard it as permissible.&#8221; Ibn Abbas added. &#8220;The people asked me to take the oath of allegiance to Ibn AzZubair. I said, &#8216;He is really entitled to assume authority for his father, Az-Zubair was the helper of the Prophet, his (maternal) grandfather, Abu Bakr was (the Prophet&#8217;s) companion in the cave, his mother, Asma&#8217; was &#8216;Dhatun-Nitaq&#8217;, his aunt, &#8216;Aisha was the mother of the Believers, his paternal aunt, Khadija was the wife of the Prophet , and the paternal aunt of the Prophet was his grandmother. He himself is pious and chaste in Islam, well versed in the Knowledge of the Quran. By Allah! (Really, I left my relatives, Bani Umaiya for his sake though) they are my close relatives, and if they should be my rulers, they are equally apt to be so and are descended from a noble family.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We entered upon Ibn &#8216;Abbas and he said &#8220;Are you not astonished at Ibn Az-Zubair&#8217;s assuming the caliphate?&#8221; I said (to myself), &#8220;I will support him and speak of his good traits as I did not do even for Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar though they were more entitled to receive al I good than he was.&#8221; I said &#8220;He (i.e Ibn Az-Zubair) is the son of the aunt of the Prophet and the son of AzZubair, and the grandson of Abu Bakr and the son of Khadija&#8217;s brother, and the son of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s sister.&#8221; Nevertheless, he considers himself to be superior to me and does not want me to be one of his friends. So I said, &#8220;I never expected that he would refuse my offer to support him, and I don&#8217;t think he intends to do me any good, therefore, if my cousins should inevitably be my rulers, it will be better for me to be ruled by them than by some others.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When we were ordered to give alms, we began to work as porters (to earn something we could give in charity). Abu Uqail came with one half of a Sa (special measure for food grains) and another person brought more than he did. So the hypocrites said, &#8220;Allah is not in need of the alms of this (i.e. &#8216;Uqail); and this other person did not give alms but for showing off.&#8221; Then Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>

He gave it to him and then &#8216;Abdullah asked the Prophet to offer the funeral prayer for him (his father). Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up to offer the funeral prayer for him, but Umar got up too and got hold of the garment of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Will you offer the funeral prayer for him though your Lord has forbidden you to offer the prayer for him&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;But Allah has given me the choice by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;(Whether you) ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times..&#8217; (9.80) so I will ask more than seventy times.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;But he (&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Ubai) is a hypocrite!&#8221; However, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did offer the funeral prayer for him whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And never (O Muhammad) pray for anyone of them that dies, nor stand at his grave.&#8217; (9.84)</p>

When Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up (to offer the prayer) I jumped towards him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you offer the prayer for Ibn Ubai although he said so-and-so on such-and-such-a day?&#8221; I went on mentioning his sayings. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and said, &#8220;Keep away from me, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But when I spoke too much to him, he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice, and I have chosen (this) ; and if I knew that if I asked forgiveness for him more than seventy times, he would be for given, I would ask it for more times than that.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and then left, but he did not stay long before the two Verses of Surat-Bara&#8217;a were revealed, i.e.:&#8211; &#8216;And never (O Muhammad) pray for anyone of them that dies&#8230;. and died in a state of rebellion.&#8217; (9.84) Later I was astonished at my daring to speak like that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah and His Apostle know best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whether you, O Muhammad, ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them, even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them,&#8221; (9.80) The he added, &#8220;I will (appeal to Allah for his sake) more than seventy times.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and we too, offered the prayer along with him. Then Allah revealed: &#8220;And never, O Muhammad, pray (funeral prayer) for anyone of them that dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Apostle and died in a state of rebellion.&#8221; (9.84)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tonight two (visitors) came to me (in my dream) and took me to a town built with gold bricks and silver bricks. There we met men who, half of their bodies, look like the most-handsome human beings you have ever seen, and the other half, the ugliest human beings you have ever seen. Those two visitors said to those men, &#8216;Go and dip yourselves in that river. So they dipped themselves therein and then came to us, their ugliness having disappeared and they were in the most-handsome shape. The visitors said, &#8216;The first is the Garden of Eden and that is your dwelling place.&#8217; Then they added, &#8216;As for those people who were half ugly and half handsome, they were those who mixed good deeds and bad deeds, but Allah forgave them.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abu Talib&#8217;s death approached, the Prophet went to him while Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya were present with him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O uncle, say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, so that I may argue for your case with it before Allah.&#8221; On that, Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Do you want to renounce &#8216;Abdul Muttalib&#8217;s religion?&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I will keep on asking (Allah for) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.&#8217; (9.113)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 199:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Kab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik who was one of the three who were forgiven, saying that he had never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa which he had fought except two Ghazwat Ghazwat-al&#8217;Usra (Tabuk) and Ghazwat-Badr. He added. &#8220;I decided to tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the forenoon, and scarcely did he return from a journey he made, except in the forenoon, he would go first to the mosque and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer. The Prophet forbade others to speak to me or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the Prophet would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Allah&#8217;s Apostle might die and I would be left in that social status among the people that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet in the last third of the night while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was with Um Salama. Um Salama sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;O Um Salama! Ka&#8217;b has been forgiven!&#8217; She said, &#8216;Shall I send someone to him to give him the good tidings?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you did so, the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.&#8217; So when the Prophet had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon whenever he was pleased. When Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us, we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet lies and remained behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be described with. Allah said: &#8216;They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you. Allah and His Apostle will observe your actions.&#8221; (9.94)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik talking about the story of the battle of Tabuk when he remained behind, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone whom Allah has helped for telling the truth more than me since I mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. And Allah revealed to His Apostle: &#8220;Verily! Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).&#8221; (9.117-119) (See Hadith No. 702 Vol 5).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 201:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra&#8217; were killed). &#8216;Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra&#8217; (those who know the Qur&#8217;an by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, &#8220;I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8216;How can I do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not done?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said (to me), &#8216;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.&#8217; So &#8216;Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as &#8216;Umar.&#8221; (Zaid bin Thabit added:) Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). &#8220;You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur&#8217;an and collect it (in one manuscript). &#8221; By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur&#8217;an. I said to both of them, &#8220;How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and Umar. So I started locating Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)&#8221; (9.128)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The manuscript on which the Quran was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with &#8216;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, Umar&#8217;s daughter.</p>

Allah will gather all the human being of early generations as well as late generation on one plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand.

You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord.

Intercede (for us with Allah), &#8220;till (the right) intercession is given to the Prophet (Muhammad) and that will be the day when Allah will raise him into a station of praise and glory (i.e. Al-Maqam -al-Mahmud).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered Mecca (in the year of the Conquest) and there were three-hundred and sixty idols around the Ka&#8217;ba. He then started hitting them with a stick in his hand and say: &#8216;Truth (i.e. Islam) has come and falsehood (disbelief) vanished. Truly falsehood (disbelief) is ever bound to vanish.&#8217; (17.81) &#8216;Truth has come and falsehood (Iblis) can not create anything.&#8217; (34.49)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was in the company of the Prophet on a farm and he was reclining on a palm leave stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others. &#8220;Ask him (the Prophet about the spirit.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;What urges you to ask him about it&#8221; Others said, &#8220;(Don&#8217;t) lest he should give you a reply which you dislike.&#8221; But they said, &#8220;Ask him.&#8221; So they asked him about the Spirit. The Prophet kept quiet and did not give them any answer. I knew that he was being divinely inspired so I stayed at my place. When the divine inspiration had been revealed, the Prophet said. &#8220;They ask you (O, Muhammad) concerning the Spirit, Say: &#8220;The spirit,&#8221; its knowledge is with my Lord; and of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a Little.&#8221; (17.85)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding): &#8216;Neither say your, prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.&#8217; (17.110) This Verse was revealed while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hiding himself in Mecca. When he prayed with his companions, he used to raise his voice with the recitation of Qur&#8217;an, and if the pagans happened to hear him, they would abuse the Qur&#8217;an, the One who revealed it and the one who brought it. Therefore Allah said to His Prophet : &#8216;Neither say your prayer aloud.&#8217; (17.110) i.e. do not recite aloud lest the pagans should hear you, but follow a way between.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not the Moses of the children of Israel&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The enemy of Allah (Nauf) told a lie.&#8221; Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Moses got up to deliver a speech before the children of Israel and he was asked, Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allah alone. So Allah revealed to him: &#8216;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;O my Lord, how can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.&#8217; So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) Allah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant &#8216;Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,&#8217; &#8216;Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.&#8217; (18.63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, &#8216;That is what we have been seeking&#8217;. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. &#8216;Is there such a greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I have come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Allah willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.&#8217; (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. &#8216;If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.&#8217; These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.&#8217; (18.71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me ?&#8217; (18.72) Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)&#8221; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.&#8217; Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.&#8217; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, &#8216;If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.&#8217; (18.76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, &#8216;These are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217; (18.78-82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Allah might have described to us more about their story.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la bin Muslim and &#8216;Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Said bin Jubair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn &#8216;Abbas, Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Ask me (any question)&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Abu Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir&#8217;s companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.&#8221; As for &#8216;Amr, he said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.&#8221; But Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Once Moses, Allah&#8217;s Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), &#8216;Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! Where is he?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;At the junction of the two seas.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Amr said to me, Allah said, &#8220;That place will be where the fish will leave you.&#8221; Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Allah said (to Moses), &#8216;Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.&#8217; &#8221; So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.&#8221; He said (to Moses).&#8221; You have not demanded too much.&#8221; And that is as mentioned by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant &#8230;. &#8216; (18.60) Yusha&#8217; bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, &#8220;While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), &#8220;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &#8216;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &#8220;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&#8221; Moses said &#8220;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&#8221; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &#8216;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&#8217; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &#8216;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&#8217;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&#8217; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, &#8216;The pious slave of Allah.&#8217; (We said to Said &#8220;Was that Khadir?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;) The boat men said, &#8216;We will not get him on board with fare.&#8217; Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, &#8216;Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. &#8220;Moses said so protestingly.&#8221;) Al-Khadir said, didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).&#8217; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya&#8217;la- said: Said said &#8216;They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody&#8217; (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said &#8216;Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya&#8217;la said, &#8216;I think Said said, &#8216;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &#8216;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, &#8216;Wages that we might had eaten.&#8217; And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them&#8221; (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8216;In front of them (was) a king.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. &#8216;A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &#8216;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&#8217; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &#8216;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&#8217; (18:81). This was in reply to Moses&#8217; saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.&#8217;? (18.74). &#8216;Near to mercy&#8221; means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa&#8217;id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi &#8216;Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf-al-Bakali &#8221; claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, &#8216;Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine Inspiration:&#8211; &#8216;Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! How can meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than &#8216;Amr said) &#8216;At the rock there was a water spring called &#8216;Al-Hayat&#8217; and none came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, &#8216;Bring our early meal&#8217; (18.62).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish &#8230;&#8217; (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there any such greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man said, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and added, &#8216;may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?&#8217; (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, &#8216;O Moses! You have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;But I will follow you.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation&#8217;s knowledge compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow&#8217;s beak.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir&#8217;s action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, &#8216;These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown them. Surely you have&#8230;&#8217; (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! &#8216; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.&#8217; (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, &#8216;When we entered this town, they neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217;&#8230;(18.78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about their story.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to recite:&#8211; &#8216;And in front (ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) &#8230;and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to Gabriel, &#8220;What prevents you from visiting us more often than you visit us now?&#8221; So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Khabbab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Al-&#8216;Asi bin Wail As-Sahmi and demanded something which he owed me. He said, &#8220;I will not give you (your money) till you disbelieve in Muhammad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I shall not disbelieve in Muhammad till you die and then be resurrected.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Will I die and then be resurrected?&#8221; I said, &#8216;Yes&#8217;. He said&#8217;, &#8220;Then I will have wealth and children there, and I will pay you (there).&#8221; So this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was a blacksmith in Mecca Once I made a sword for Al-&#8216;Asi bin Wail As-Sahmi. When I went to demand its price, he said, &#8220;I will not give it to you till you disbelieve in Muhammad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I shall not disbelieve in Muhammad till Allah make you die and then bring you to life again.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If Allah should make me die and then resurrect me and I would have wealth and children.&#8221; So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Signs, and (yet) says I shall certainly be given wealth and children? Has he known the unseen or has he taken a covenant from (Allah) the Beneficent?&#8217; (19.77-78)</p>

You are the one whom Allah selected for His Message and for His direct talk. Yet you blame me for a thing which Allah had ordained for me before He created me?.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle further said, &#8220;So Adam overcame Moses by this Argument.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;You (people) will be gathered before Allah (on the Day of Resurrection) bare-footed, naked and uncircumcised.&#8221; (The Prophet then recited):&#8211; &#8216;As We began the first creation We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise We have undertaken and truly We shall do it.&#8217; and added, &#8220;The first man who will be dressed on the Day of Resurrection, will be Abraham. Lo! Some men from my followers will be brought and taken towards the left side, whereupon I will say, &#8216;O Lord, (these are) my companions!&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You do not know what new things they introduced (into the religion) after you.&#8217; I will then say as the righteous pious slave, Jesus, said, &#8216;I was a witness over them while I dwelt among them&#8230;(to His Statement)..and You are the Witness to all things.&#8217; (5.117) Then it will be said, &#8216;(O Muhammad) These people never stopped to apostate since you left them.&#8221;</p>

Who are the mission for the (Hell) Fire?&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Out of each thousand, take out 999.&#8217; At that time every pregnant female shall drop her load (have a miscarriage) and a child will have grey hair. And you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet not drunk, but severe will be the torment of Allah.&#8221; (22.2) (When the Prophet mentioned this), the people were so distressed (and afraid) that their faces got changed (in color) whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;From Gog and Magog nine-hundred ninety-nine will be taken out and one from you. You Muslims (compared to the large number of other people) will be like a black hair on the side of a white ox, or a white hair on the side of a black ox, and I hope that you will be one-fourth of the people of Paradise.&#8221; On that, we said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;I hope that you will be) one-third of the people of Paradise.&#8221; We again said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;(I hope that you will be) one-half of the people of Paradise.&#8221; So we said, Allahu Akbar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Saud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi who was the chief of Bani Ajlan and said, &#8220;What do you say about a man who has found another man with his wife? Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (i.e. the husband), or what should he do? Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; Asim then went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (And asked him that question) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked the question,&#8221; When &#8216;Uwaimir asked &#8216;Asim (about the Prophet&#8217;s answer) &#8216;Asim replied that Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked such questions and considered it shameful. &#8220;Uwaimir then said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give up asking unless I ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it.&#8221; Uwaimir came (to the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! A man has found another man with his wife! Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (the husband, in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed regarding you and your wife&#8217;s case in the Qur&#8217;an &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered them to perform the measures of Mula&#8217;ana according to what Allah had mentioned in His Book. So &#8216;Uwaimir did Mula&#8217;ana with her and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I kept her I would oppress her.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a tradition after them for those who happened to be involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;Look! If she (Uwaimir&#8217;s wife) delivers a black child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat legs, then I will be of the opinion that &#8216;Uwaimir has spoken the truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we will consider that &#8216;Uwaimir has told a lie against her.&#8221; Later on she delivered a child carrying the qualities which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned as a proof for &#8216;Uwaimir&#8217;s claim; therefore the child was ascribed to its mother henceforth.</p>

Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him whereupon you might kill him (i.e. the killer) (in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; So Allah revealed concerning their case what is mentioned of the order of Mula&#8217;ana. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the man, &#8220;The matter between you and your wife has been decided.&#8221; So they did Mula&#8217;ana in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, and then the man divorced his wife. So it became a tradition to dissolve the marriage of those spouses who were involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. The woman was pregnant and the husband denied that he was the cause of her pregnancy, so the son was (later) ascribed to her. Then it became a tradition that such a son would be the heir of his mother, and she would inherit of him what Allah prescribed for her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 271:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma&#8217; and filed the case before the Prophet. The Prophet said (to Hilal), &#8220;Either you bring forth a proof (four witnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If anyone of us saw a man over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying, &#8220;Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal then said, &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal to you what will save my back from legal punishment.&#8221; Then Gabriel came down and revealed to him:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;As for those who accuse their wives&#8230;&#8217; (24.6-9) The Prophet recited it till he reached: &#8216;&#8230; (her accuser) is telling the truth.&#8217; Then the Prophet left and sent for the woman, and Hilal went (and brought) her and then took the oaths (confirming the claim). The Prophet was saying, &#8220;Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so will any of you repent?&#8221; Then the woman got up and took the oaths and when she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, &#8220;It (the fifth oath) will definitely bring Allah&#8217;s curse on you (if you are guilty).&#8221; So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking the oath) so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then she said, &#8220;I will not dishonor my family all through these days,&#8221; and carried on (the process of taking oaths). The Prophet then said, &#8220;Watch her; if she delivers a black-eyed child with big hips and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma&#8217;s child.&#8221; Later she delivered a child of that description. So the Prophet said, &#8220;If the case was not settled by Allah&#8217;s Law, I would punish her severely.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 273:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for him among them who had the greater share..&#8217; (24.11) was Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 274:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu&#8217;attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah&#8217;s Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; and then depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined ! &#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8220;O you there! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he has said?&#8221; I said, &#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8221; At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8220;O my mother! What are the people talking about?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.&#8221; But &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: So Allah&#8217;s Apostle called for Barira and said, &#8220;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, &#8220;By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,&#8221; Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.&#8221; On that, Sad bin &#8216;Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), &#8220;By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!&#8221; On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8220;You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!&#8221; So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, &#8220;Thereafter, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then I said to my mother, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8220;By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph&#8217;s father: &#8220;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, &#8220;Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.&#8221; My mother said to me, &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not&#8230;.&#8221; (24.11-20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter&#8217;s kinship to him and his poverty, said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha&#8221;. So Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&#8217;s Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.&#8221; So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.&#8221; Aisha further said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, &#8220;O Zainab! What have you seen?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).&#8221; Of all the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.</p>

Thereupon Hassan said the following poetic verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A chaste pious woman who arouses no suspicion. She never talks about chaste heedless women behind their backs.&#8217; On that she said, &#8220;But you are not so.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;and as for him among them who had the greater share therein&#8217;?&#8221; (24.11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;What punishment is worse than blindness?&#8221; She added, &#8220;And he used to defend Allah&#8217;s Apostle against the pagans (in his poetry).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&#8221; Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Allow me to chop their heads off&#8221; Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh), &#8220;You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.&#8221; It was probable that some evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, &#8220;Let Mistah. be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;O mother Why do you abuse your Son&#8221; On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Why do you abuse your son?&#8221; She stumbled for the third time and said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not abuse him except because of you.&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Concerning what of my affairs?&#8221; So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, &#8220;Has this really happened?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; I returned to my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Send me to my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, &#8220;What has brought you, O (my) daughter?&#8221; I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.&#8221; But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), &#8220;Does my father know about it?&#8221; She said, &#8220;yes&#8221; I asked, Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle know about it too?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, Allah&#8217;s Apostle does too.&#8221; So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, &#8220;What is the matter with her? &#8221; She said, &#8220;She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk).&#8221; On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home&#8221; I went back to my home and Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.&#8221; On that, some of the Prophet&#8217;s companions spoke harshly to her and said, &#8220;Tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.&#8221; Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.&#8221; Later that man was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, &#8220;Now then O &#8216;Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.&#8221; An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah&#8217;s Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!&#8221; And after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, &#8220;Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, &#8216;She has confessed herself guilty.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob&#8217;s name but couldn&#8217;t) Joseph&#8217;s father when he said; So (for me) &#8220;Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, &#8220;Have the good tidings O &#8216; &#8220;Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.&#8221; At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me),&#8221; (Aisha used to say:) &#8220;But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet&#8217;s wife), Allah protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) &#8230;Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.&#8221; So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abu Talib was on his death bed, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to him and found with him, Abu Jahl and Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya bin Al-Mughira. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, a sentence with which I will defend you before Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said to Abu Talib, &#8220;Will you now leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting him to say that sentence while the other two kept on repeating their sentence before him till Abu Talib said as the last thing he said to them, &#8220;I am on the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib,&#8221; and refused to say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Allah, I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans.&#8217; (9.113) And then Allah revealed especially about Abu Talib:&#8211;&#8216;Verily! You (O, Muhammad) guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He will.&#8217; (28.56)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 297:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, &#8220;Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof.&#8221; That news scared us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas&#8217;ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, &#8220;He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, &#8216;Allah knows best,&#8217; for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)&#8217; (38.86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet invoked evil on them, saying, &#8216;O Allah! Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.&#8217; So they were afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You came to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Allah (to relieve them).&#8217; Then Ibn Mas&#8217;ud recited:&#8211; &#8216;Then watch you for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;.but truly you will return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Allah (threatened them thus): &#8216;On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Allah&#8217;s saying- &#8220;Lizama&#8221; (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Alif-Lam-Mim, the Romans have been defeated, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious,&#8217; (30.1-3) (This verse): Indicates that the defeat of Byzantine has already passed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When there was revealed: &#8216;It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong.&#8217; (6.82) It was very hard for the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, so they said, &#8220;Which of us has not confused his belief with wrong?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Verse does not mean this. Don&#8217;t you hear Luqman&#8217;s statement to his son: &#8216;Verily! Joining others in worship, with Allah is a great wrong indeed.&#8217; (31.13)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 300:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting with the people, a man came to him walking and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. What is Belief?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Belief is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Apostles, and the meeting with Him, and to believe in the Resurrection.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Islam?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Islam is to worship Allah and not worship anything besides Him, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the (compulsory) charity i.e. Zakat and to fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The man again asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Ihsan (i.e. perfection or Benevolence)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not achieve this state of devotion, then (take it for granted that) Allah sees you.&#8221; The man further asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle When will the Hour be established?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet replied, &#8220;The one who is asked about it does not know more than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its portents. The Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.&#8221; (31.34) Then the man left. The Prophet said, &#8220;Call him back to me.&#8221; They went to call him back but could not see him. The Prophet said, &#8220;That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 47 Vol 1)</p>

All that is reserved, besides which, all that you have seen, is nothing.&#8221; Then he recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;No soul knows what is kept hidden (in reserve) for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.&#8217; (32.17)</p>

Recite if you wish: &#8216;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.&#8217; (33.6) so if a believer (dies) leaves some property then his relatives will inherit that property; but if he is in debt or he leaves poor children, let those (creditors and children) come to me (that I may pay the debt and provide for the children), for them I am his sponsor (surely).</p>

Then he said, &#8220;Allah says:&#8211;</p>

When he noticed that (there was no response to his movement), he got up, and the others too, got up except three persons who kept on sitting. The Prophet came back in order to enter his house, but he went away again. Then they left, whereupon I set out and went to the Prophet to tell him that they had departed, so he came and entered his house. I wanted to enter along with him, but he put a screen between me and him. Then Allah revealed:</p>

They sat down (after finishing their meal) and started chatting. So the Prophet went out and then returned several times while they were still sitting and talking. So Allah revealed the Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses until leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation &#8230;..ask them from behind a screen.&#8217; (33.53) So the screen was set up and the people went away.</p>

So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Carry away the remaining food.&#8221; Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting. The Prophet left and went towards the dwelling place of Aisha and said, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you, O the people of the house!&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you too. How did you find your wife? May Allah bless you. Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him. Then the Prophet returned and found a group of three persons still in the house chatting. The Prophet was a very shy person, so he went out (for the second time) and went towards the dwelling place of &#8216;Aisha. I do not remember whether I informed him that the people have gone away. So he returned and as soon as he entered the gate, he drew the curtain between me and him, and then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.</p>

He would greet them and invoke good on them, and they (too) would return his greeting and invoke good on him. When he returned to his house, he found two men talking to each other; and when he saw them, he went out of his house again. When those two men saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle: going out of his house, they quickly got up (and departed).

She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &#8220;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I went out to answer the call of nature and &#8216;Umar said to me so-and-so.&#8221; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &#8220;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&#8221;</p>

Allah, the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais asked permission to visit me but I refused to permit him unless I took your permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What stopped you from permitting him? He is your uncle.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man was not the person who had nursed me, but the woman, the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais had nursed me.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, for he is your uncle.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, &#8220;What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&#8221; (34.23). Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other.&#8221; (Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers.) A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller. Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?&#8217; So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day the Prophet ascended Safa mountain and said, &#8220;Oh Sabah! &#8221; All the Quraish gathered round him and said, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He said, Look, if I told you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, would you not believe me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, we will believe you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am a warner to you in face of a terrible punishment.&#8221; On that Abu Lahab said, &#8220;May you perish ! Is it for this thing that you have gathered us?&#8221; So Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!&#8230;&#8217; (111.1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I was with the Prophet in the mosque at the time of sunset. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Dharr! Do you know where the sun sets?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It goes and prostrates underneath (Allah&#8217;s) Throne; and that is Allah&#8217;s Statement:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (decreed). And that is the decree of All-Mighty, the All-Knowing&#8230;.&#8217; (36.38)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Muhajid regarding the prostration in Surat Sad. He said, &#8220;Ibn Abbas was asked the same question and he said, &#8216;Those are they (the prophets) whom Allah had Guided. So follow their guidance.&#8221; (6.90) Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to perform a prostration (on reading this Sura).</p>

Those are they whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.&#8217; (6.90) So David was the one of those prophets whom Prophet (Muhammad) was ordered to follow. David prostrated, so Allah&#8217;s Apostle (Muhammad) performed this prostration too.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Last night a demon from the Jinns came to me (or the Prophet said, a similar sentence) to disturb my prayer, but Allah gave me the power to overcome him. I intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque till the morning so that all of you could see him, but then I remembered the Statement of my brother Solomon:&#8211;&#8216;My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; (38.35) The narrator added: Then he (the Prophet) dismissed him, rejected. &#8216;Nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came upon &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud and he said &#8220;O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, &#8220;Allah knows better,&#8217; for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to His Prophet: &#8216;Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Quran) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad-Dukhan (the smoke), Allah&#8217;s Apostle invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph.&#8221; So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.&#8217; (44.10-11) (So they invoked Allah) &#8220;Our Lord! Remove the punishment from us really we are believers.&#8221; How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: &#8216;One taught (by a human being), a madman?&#8217; &#8216;We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The day We shall seize you with a mighty grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8221; (44.16)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pagans who committed murders in great number and committed illegal sexual intercourse excessively, came to Muhammad and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Whatever you say and invite people to, is good: but we wish if you could inform us whether we can make an expiration for our (past evil) deeds.&#8221; So the Divine Verses came: &#8216;Those who invoke not with Allah any other god, not kill such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; (25.68) And there was also revealed:&#8211; &#8216;Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against their souls!

We learn that Allah will put all the heavens on one finger, and the earths on one finger, and the trees on one finger, and the water and the dust on one finger, and all the other created beings on one finger. Then He will say, &#8216;I am the King.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet smiled so that his pre-molar teeth became visible, and that was the confirmation of the Rabbi. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As to inform me of the worst thing the pagans had done to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said: &#8220;While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was praying in the courtyard of the ka&#8217;ba, &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait came and seized Allah&#8217;s Apostle by the shoulder and twisted his garment round his neck and throttled him severely. Abu Bakr came and seized &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s shoulder and threw him away from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Would you kill a man because he says: &#8216;My Lord is Allah,&#8217; and has come to you with clear Signs from your Lord?&#8221; (40.28)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Five things have passed, i.e. the smoke, the defeat of the Romans, the splitting of the moon, Al-Batsha (the defeat of the infidels in the battle of Badr) and Al-Lizam (the punishment)&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 346:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to obey the Prophet, he asked Allah to afflict them with years of famine similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between him and the sky because of extreme fatigue. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people; this is a painfull of torment.&#8217; (44.10-11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then someone (Abu Sufyan) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to send rain for the tribes of Mudar for they are on the verge of destruction.&#8221; On that the Prophet said (astonishingly) &#8220;Shall I invoke Allah) for the tribes of Mudar? Verily, you are a brave man!&#8221; But the Prophet prayed for rain and it rained for them. Then the Verse was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;But truly you will return (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.15) (When the famine was over and) they restored prosperity and welfare, they reverted to their ways (of heathenism) whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;On the Day when We shall seize you with a Mighty Grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.16) The narrator said, &#8220;That was the day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of having knowledge that, when you do not know something, you say: &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to his Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist)&#8217; (38.86) When the Quraish troubled and stood against the Prophet he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the seven years of Joseph.&#8221; So they were stricken with a year of famine during which they ate bones and dead animals because of too much suffering, and one of them would see something like smoke between him and the sky because of hunger. Then they said: Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it was said to the Prophet (by Allah), &#8220;If we remove it from them. they will revert to their ways (of heathenism).&#8221; So the Prophet invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Allah punished them on the day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Allah&#8217;s Statement indicates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;we will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.10).</p>

So he (the Prophet) said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years of Joseph.&#8217; So they were stricken with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they started eating dead animals, and if one of them got up he would see something like smoke between him and the sky from the severe fatigue and hunger.&#8221; Abdullah then recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. This is a painful torment&#8230; (till he reached) &#8230;&#8230;.. We shall indeed remove the punishment for a while, but truly you will revert (to heathenism): (44.10-15) &#8216;Abdullah added: &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He added,&#8221; The severe grasp&#8221; was the Day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

(38.68) When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw Quraish standing against him, he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years (of famine) of Joseph. So they were afflicted with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they ate bones and hides. (One of them said), &#8220;And they ate hides and dead animals, and (it seemed to them that) something like smoke was coming out of the earth. So Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Your people are on the verge of destruction! Please invoke Allah to relieve them.&#8221; So the Prophet invoked Allah for them (and the famine disappeared). He said to them. &#8220;You will revert (to heathenism) after that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah then recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;&#8230;.but truly you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; He added, &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them in the Hereafter? The smoke and the grasp and the Al-Lizam have all passed.&#8221; One of the sub-narrater said, &#8220;The splitting of the moon.&#8221; And another said, &#8220;The defeat of the Romans (has passed).&#8221;</p>

And whenever he saw clouds or winds, signs of deep concern would appear on his face. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! When people see clouds they usually feel happy, hoping that it would rain, while I see that when you see clouds, one could notice signs of dissatisfaction on your face.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! What is the guarantee for me that there will be no punishment in it, since some people were punished with a wind? Verily, some people saw (received) the punishment, but (while seeing the cloud) they said, &#8216;This cloud will give us rain.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was proceeding at night during one of his journeys and &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab was traveling beside him, &#8216;Umar asked him about something but Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not reply. He asked again, but he did not reply, and then he asked (for the third time) but he did not reply. On that, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said to himself, &#8220;Thakilat Ummu &#8216;Umar (May &#8216;Umar&#8217;s mother lose her son)! I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle three times but he did not reply.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;I made my camel run faster and went ahead of the people, and I was afraid that some Qur&#8217;anic Verses might be revealed about me. But before getting involved in any other matter. I heard somebody calling me. I said to myself, &#8216;I fear that some Qur&#8217;anic Verses have been revealed about me,&#8217; and so I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greeted him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) said, &#8216;Tonight a Sura has been revealed to me, and it is dearer to me than that on which the sun rises (i.e. the world)&#8217; Then he recited: &#8220;Verily, We have given you a manifest victory.&#8221; (48.1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of the Conquest of Mecca, the Prophet recited Surat Al-Fath in a vibrating and pleasant voice. (Muawaiya, the subnarrator said, &#8220;If I could imitate the recitation of the Prophet I would do so.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner.&#8217; (48.8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which is in the Qur&#8217;an, appears in the Surah thus: &#8216;Verily We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner, and as a protector for the illiterates (i.e., the Arabs.) You are my slave and My Apostle, and I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (one who depends upon Allah). You are neither hard-hearted nor of fierce character, nor one who shouts in the markets. You do not return evil for evil, but excuse and forgive. Allah will not take you unto Him till He guides through you a crocked (curved) nation on the right path by causing them to say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; With such a statement He will cause to open blind eyes, deaf ears and hardened hearts.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;That was the tranquility (calmness) which descended because of the recitation of the Quran.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Habib bin Abi Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Abu Wail to ask him (about those who had rebelled against &#8216;Ali). On that Abu Wail said, &#8220;We were at Siffin (a city on the bank of the Euphrates, the place where me battle took place between &#8216;Ali and Muawiya) A man said, &#8220;Will you be on the side of those who are called to consult Allah&#8217;s Book (to settle the dispute)?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8216;Yes (I agree that we should settle the matter in the light of the Qur&#8217;an).&#8221; &#8216; Some people objected to &#8216;Ali&#8217;s agreement and wanted to fight. On that Sahl bin Hunaif said, &#8216;Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (i.e. the peace treaty between the Prophet and the Quraish pagans), if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time &#8216;Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won&#8217;t our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.&#8221; So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! He is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Allah will never neglect him.&#8221; Then Sura Al-Fath (The Victory) was revealed.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 368:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two righteous persons were about to be ruined. They were Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar who raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet when a mission from Bani Tamim came to him. One of the two recommended Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habeas, the brother of Bani Mujashi (to be their governor) while the other recommended somebody else. (Nafi&#8217;, the sub-narrator said, I do not remember his name). Abu Bakr said to Umar, &#8220;You wanted nothing but to oppose me!&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you.&#8221; Their voices grew loud in that argument, so Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet.&#8217; (49.2) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;Since the revelation of this Verse, &#8216;Umar used to speak in such a low tone that the Prophet had to ask him to repeat his statements.&#8221; But Ibn Az-Zubair did not mention the same about his (maternal) grandfather (i.e. Abu Bakr).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet missed Thabit bin Qais for a period (So he inquired about him). A man said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will bring you his news.&#8221; So he went to Thabit and found him sitting in his house and bowing his head. The man said to Thabit, &#8221; &#8216;What is the matter with you?&#8221; Thabit replied that it was an evil affair, for he used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds had been annulled, and he considered himself as one of the people of the Fire. Then the man returned to the Prophet and told him that Thabit had said, so-and-so. (Musa bin Anas) said: The man returned to Thabit with great glad tidings. The Prophet said to the man. &#8220;Go back to him and say to him: &#8220;You are not from the people of the Hell Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet (and requested him to appoint a governor for them). Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Appoint Al-Qaqa bin Mabad.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Appoint Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habeas.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr said (to &#8216;Umar). &#8220;You did not want but to oppose me!&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you!&#8221; So both of them argued till their voices grew loud. So the following Verse was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Be not for ward&#8230;&#8230;&#8217; (49.1)</p>

Why do only the weak and the humble among the people enter me?&#8217; On that, Allah said to Paradise. &#8216;You are My Mercy which I bestow on whoever I wish of my servants.&#8217; Then Allah said to the (Hell) Fire, &#8216;You are my (means of) punishment by which I punish whoever I wish of my slaves. And each of you will have its fill.&#8217; As for the Fire (Hell), it will not be filled till Allah puts His Foot over it whereupon it will say, &#8216;Qati! Qati!&#8217; At that time it will be filled, and its different parts will come closer to each other; and Allah will not wrong any of His created beings. As regards Paradise, Allah will create a new creation to fill it with.&#8221;</p>

So, whoever can, should not miss the offering of prayers before sunrise (Fajr prayer) and before sunset (Asr prayer).&#8221; Then the Prophet recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And celebrate the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.&#8217; (50.39)</p>

Nay, but they have no firm belief Or do they own the treasures of Your Lord?

He is the Most Courteous Well-Acquainted with all things.&#8217; (6.103) &#8216;It is not fitting for a human being that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil.&#8217; (42.51) &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And whoever tells you that the Prophet knows what is going to happen tomorrow, is a liar.&#8221; She then recited:</p>

Take the letter from her.&#8221; So we set out, and our horses ran at full pace till we reached Raudat Khakh, and behold, we saw the lady and said (to her), &#8220;Take out the letter!&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Either you take out the letter or we will strip you of your clothes.&#8221; So she took the letter out of her hair braid. We brought the letter to the Prophet and behold, it was addressed by Hatib bin Abi Balta&#8217;a to some pagans at Mecca, informing them of some of the affairs of the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;What is this, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;Do not be hasty with me, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am an Ansari man and do not belong to them (Quraish infidels) while the emigrants who were with you had their relatives who used to protect their families and properties at Mecca. So, to compensate for not having blood relation with them.&#8217; I intended to do them some favor so that they might protect my relatives (at Mecca), and I did not do this out of disbelief or an inclination to desert my religion.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to his companions), &#8220;He (Hatib) has told you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off?&#8221; The Apostle said, &#8220;He is one of those who witnessed (fought in) the Battle of Badr, and what do you know, perhaps Allah looked upon the people of Badr (Badr warriors) and said, &#8216;Do what you want as I have forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; (Amr, a sub-narrator, said,: This Verse was revealed about him (Hatib):</p>

Once the Prophet (after completing the prayer and the sermon) came down, as if I am now looking at him waving at the men with his hand to sit down, and walked through them till he, along with Bilal, reached (the rows of) the women. Then he recited: &#8216;O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance that they will not worship anything other than Allah, will not steal, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, will not kill their children, and will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (by making illegal children belonging to their husbands)&#8217;&#8230;.(60.12) Having finished, he said, &#8216;Do you agree to that?&#8221; One lady, other than whom none replied the Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; (The, sub-narrator, Al-Hasan did not know who the lady was.)

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When the hypocrites come to you, they say: &#8216;We bear witness that you are indeed the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; (63.1) So the Prophet sent for me and recited it and said, &#8220;Allah has confirmed your statement.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in a Ghazwa (Sufyan once said, in an army) and a man from the emigrants kicked an Ansari man (on the buttocks with his foot). The Ansari man said, &#8220;O the Ansar! (Help!)&#8221; and the emigrant said. &#8220;O the emigrants! (Help!) Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard that and said, &#8220;What is this call for, which is characteristic of the period of ignorance?&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! A man from the emigrants kicked one of the Ansar (on the buttocks with his foot).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Leave it (that call) as is a detestable thing.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai heard that and said, &#8216;Have the (the emigrants) done so? By Allah, if we return Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner.&#8221; When this statement reached the Prophet. &#8216;Umar got up an, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai)!&#8221; The Prophet said &#8220;Leave him, lest the people say that Muhammad kills his companions.&#8221; The Ansar were then more in number than the emigrants when the latter came to Medina, but later on the emigrant increased.</p>

When Zaid bin Arqarr heard of my intense grief (over the killed Ansar), he wrote a letter to me saying that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, O Allah! Forgive the Ansar and the Ansar children. The subnarrator, Ibn Al-Fadl, is not sure whether the Prophet also said, And their grand-children.&#8221; Some of those who were present, asked Anas (about Zaid). He said, &#8220;He (Zaid) is the one about whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;He is the one whose sound hearing Allah testified.&#8217;</p>

On that the Ansar said, &#8216;O the Ansar!&#8217; and the emigrant said, &#8216;O the emigrants!&#8221; The Prophet said&#8217; &#8220;Leave it (that call) for it Is a detestable thing.&#8221; The number of Ansar was larger (than that of the emigrants) at the time when the Prophet came to Medina, but later the number of emigrants increased. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &#8220;Have they, (the emigrants) done so?

<p style="text-align:justify;">of that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle became very angry at that and said, &#8220;(Ibn &#8216;Umar must return her to his house and keep her as his wife till she becomes clean and then menstruates and becomes clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to divorce her, he may do so while she is still clean and before having any sexual relations with her, for that is the legally prescribed period for divorce as Allah has ordered.&#8221;</p>

She replied. &#8220;The husband of Subai &#8216;a al Aslamiya was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then her hand was asked in marriage and Allah&#8217;s Apostle married her (to somebody). Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who asked for her hand in marriage&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to drink honey in the house of Zainab, the daughter of Jahsh, and would stay there with her. So Hafsa and I agreed secretly that, if he come to either of us, she would say to him. &#8220;It seems you have eaten Maghafir (a kind of bad-smelling resin), for I smell in you the smell of Maghafir,&#8221; (We did so) and he replied. &#8220;No, but I was drinking honey in the house of Zainab, the daughter of Jahsh, and I shall never take it again. I have taken an oath as to that, and you should not tell anybody about it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 435:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the whole year I had the desire to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab regarding the explanation of a Verse (in Surat Al-Tahrim) but I could not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet who aided one another against him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They were Hafsa and &#8216;Aisha.&#8221; Then I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you.&#8221; Then Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, &#8220;I recommend that you do so-and-so.&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?&#8221; She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You don&#8217;t want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full day!&#8221; &#8216;Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;O my daughter! Do you argue with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?&#8221; H. afsa said, &#8220;By Allah, we argue with him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Know that I warn you of Allah&#8217;s punishment and the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . . O my daughter! Don&#8217;t be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for her (i.e. &#8216;Aisha).&#8221; &#8216;Umar addled, &#8220;Then I went out to Um Salama&#8217;s house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives!&#8217; By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, &#8220;Open Open!&#8217; I said, &#8216;Has the king of Ghassan come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but something worse; Allah&#8217;s Apostle has isolated himself from his wives.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let the nose of &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. humiliated)!&#8217; Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, &#8216;Say (to the Prophet ) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.&#8217; Then the Prophet admitted me and I narrated the story to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When I reached the story of Um Salama, Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said.&#8217; &#8216;Why are you weeping?&#8217; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Allah&#8217;s Apostle though you are, is living in destitute&#8221;. The Prophet then replied. &#8216;Won&#8217;t you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?&#8217; &#8220;</p>

For one year I was seeking the opportunity to ask this question, but in vain, until once when I accompanied him for Hajj. While we were in Zahran, &#8216;Umar went to answer the call of nature and told me to follow him with some water for ablution. So I followed him with a container of water and started pouring water for him. I found it a good opportunity to ask him, so I said, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were those two ladies who had backed each other (against the Prophet)?&#8221; Before I could complete my question, he replied, &#8220;They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out along with a group of his companions towards &#8216;Ukaz Market. At that time something intervened between the devils and the news of the Heaven, and flames were sent down upon them, so the devils returned. Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? &#8221; They said, &#8220;Something has intervened between us and the news of the Heaven, and fires (flames) have been shot at us.&#8221; Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;Nothing has intervened between you and the news of the Heaven, but an important event has happened. Therefore, travel all over the world, east and west, and try to find out what has happened.&#8221; And so they set out and travelled all over the world, east and west, looking for that thing which intervened between them and the news of the Heaven. Those of the devils who had set out towards Tihama, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at Nakhla (a place between Mecca and Taif) while he was on his way to Ukaz Market. (They met him) while he was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Holy Qur&#8217;an being recited (by Allah&#8217;s Apostle), they listened to it and said (to each other). This is the thing which has intervened between you and the news of the Heavens.&#8221; Then they returned to their people and said, &#8220;O our people! We have really heard a wonderful recital (Qur&#8217;an). It gives guidance to the right, and we have believed therein. We shall not join in worship, anybody with our Lord.&#8221; (See 72.1-2) Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (Surat al-Jinn):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: It has been revealed to me that a group (3 to 9) of Jinns listened (to the Qur&#8217;an).&#8217; (72.1) The statement of the Jinns was revealed to him .</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was in seclusion in the cave of Hiram&#8217;, and after I completed the limited period of my seclusion. I came down (from the cave) and heard a voice calling me. I looked to my right, but saw nothing. Then I looked up and saw something. So I went to Khadija (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) and told her to wrap me up and pour cold water on me. So they wrapped me up and poured cold water on me.&#8221; Then, &#8216;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped up! Arise and warn,&#8217; (Surat Al Muddaththir) was revealed.&#8221; (74.1)</p>

I was too much afraid of him (so I returned to my house) and said, &#8216;Fold me up in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me up.

I was so terrified by him that I fell down on the ground. Then I went to my wife and said, &#8216;Wrap me in garments! Wrap me in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me, and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped-up! Arise and warn&#8230;and desert the idols.&#8221; (74.1-5) Abu Salama said&#8230;.Rujz means idols.&#8221; After that, the Divine Inspiration started coming more frequently and regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 449:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to move his tongue when the divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. (Sufyan, a subnarrator, demonstrated (how the Prophet used to move his lips) and added. &#8220;In order to memorize it.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 450:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Musa bin Abi Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he asked Said bin Jubair regarding (the statement of Allah). &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that the Prophet used to move his lips when the Divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. So the Prophet was ordered not to move his tongue, which he used to do, lest some words should escape his memory. &#8216;It is for Us to collect it&#8217; means, We will collect it in your chest;&#8217; and its recitation&#8217; means, We will make you recite it. &#8216;But when We recite it (i.e. when it is revealed to you), follow its recital; it is for Us to explain it and make it clear,&#8217; (i.e. We will explain it through your tongue).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Gabriel revealed the Divine Inspiration in Allah&#8217;s Apostle , he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) moved his tongue and lips, and that state used to be very hard for him, and that movement indicated that revelation was taking place. So Allah revealed in Surat Al-Qiyama which begins:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection&#8230;&#8217; (75) the Verses:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it (Quran) in your mind, and give you the ability to recite it by heart. (75.16-17) Ibn Abbas added: It is for Us to collect it (Qur&#8217;an) (in your mind), and give you the ability to recite it by heart means, &#8220;When We reveal it, listen. Then it is for Us to explain it,&#8221; means, &#8216;It is for us to explain it through your tongue.&#8217; So whenever Gabriel came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8216; he would keep quiet (and listen), and when the Angel left, the Prophet would recite that revelation as Allah promised him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 478:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, &#8216;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.1-5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, &#8220;Cover me!&#8221; They covered him, and when the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, &#8220;O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me.&#8221; Then he told her the story. Khadija said, &#8220;Nay! But receive the good tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist those who are stricken with calamities.&#8221; Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija&#8217;s paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to say.&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet then described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young.&#8221; He added some other statement. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Will these people drive me out?&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you strongly.&#8221; But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was very much grieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was talking about the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. &#8220;Once while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in the cave of Hira.&#8217; He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap me!&#8221; So they covered him and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your garments purify and dessert the idols.&#8217; (74.1-5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salama said, &#8220;(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the Pre-lslamic period used to worship.&#8221; After this the revelation started coming frequently and regularly.</p>

As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, he is the one who ties it for Allah&#8217;s Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then, whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be written for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a source of) reward for such a man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from asking others for help and he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right, i.e. pays its Zakat and gives it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause, then that horse will be a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be a burden (of sins) for him.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked regarding donkeys. He replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive Verse which includes everything:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; and whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.&#8217; (99.7-8)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was asked about donkeys and he replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me regarding donkeys except this comprehensive Verse which includes everything:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; And whoever, does evil equal to the weight of an atom or a smallest ant) shall see it.&#8217; (99.7-8)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 488:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet was made to ascend to the Heavens, he said (after his return), &#8220;I came upon a river the banks of which were made of tents of hollow pearls. I asked Gabriel. What is this (river?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;This is the Kauthar.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 489:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ubaida:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha &#8216;regarding the verse:&#8211;&#8216;Verily we have granted you the Kauthar.&#8217; She replied, &#8220;The Kauthar is a river which has been given to your Prophet on the banks of which there are (tents of) hollow pearls and its utensils are as numberless as the stars.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 490:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bishr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Said bin Jubair said that Ibn &#8216;Abbas said about Al-Kauthar. &#8220;That is the good which Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle.&#8221; I said to Sa&#8217;id bin Jubair. &#8220;But the people claim that it is a river in Paradise.&#8221; Said said, &#8220;The river in Paradise is part of the good which Allah has bestowed on His Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 491:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the &#8220;Surat-An-Nasr&#8221;, &#8216;When comes the Help of Allah and the conquest,&#8217; had been revealed to the Prophet he did not offer any prayer except that he said therein, &#8220;Subhanka Rabbana wa bihamdika; Allahumma ighfirli (I testify the Uniqueness of our Lord, and all the praises are for Him: O Allah, forgive me!&#8221;)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 492:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to say very often in bowing and prostration (during his prayers), Subhanka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika; Allahumma ighfirli,&#8221; according to the order of the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 493:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar asked the people regarding Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When comes the Help of Allah (to you O Muhammad against your enemies) and the conquest of Mecca.&#8217; (110.1) They replied, &#8220;It indicates the future conquest of towns and palaces (by Muslims).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What do you say about it, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;(This Surat) indicates the termination of the life of Muhammad. Through it he was informed of the nearness of his death.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 494:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar used to make me sit with the elderly men who had fought in the Battle of Badr. Some of them felt it (did not like that) and said to &#8216;Umar &#8220;Why do you bring in this boy to sit with us while we have sons like him?&#8221; Umar replied, &#8220;Because of what you know of his position (i.e. his religious knowledge.)&#8221; One day &#8216;Umar called me and made me sit in the gathering of those people; and I think that he called me just to show them. (my religious knowledge). &#8216;Umar then asked them (in my presence). &#8220;What do you say about the interpretation of the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When comes Help of Allah (to you O, Muhammad against your enemies) and the conquest (of Mecca).&#8217; (110.1) Some of them said, &#8220;We are ordered to praise Allah and ask for His forgiveness when Allah&#8217;s Help and the conquest (of Mecca) comes to us.&#8221; Some others kept quiet and did not say anything. On that, &#8216;Umar asked me, &#8220;Do you say the same, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8216;What do you say then?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;That is the sign of the death of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which Allah informed him of. Allah said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;(O Muhammad) When comes the Help of Allah (to you against your enemies) and the conquest (of Mecca) (which is the sign of your death). You should celebrate the praises of your Lord and ask for His Forgiveness, and He is the One Who accepts the repentance and forgives.&#8217; (110.3) On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I do not know anything about it other than what you have said.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 495:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211; &#8216;And warn your tribe of near kindred.&#8217; (26.214) was revealed. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out, and when he had ascended As-Safa mountain, he shouted, &#8220;O Sabahah!&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; &#8220;Then they gathered around him, whereupon he said, &#8220;Do you see? If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have never heard you telling a lie.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said, &#8220;May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason? &#8221; Then Abu Lahab went away. So the &#8220;Surat:&#8211;ul&#8211;LAHAB&#8221; &#8216;Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!&#8217; (111.1) was revealed.</p>

If I tell you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, will you believe me?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said, &#8220;Is it for this reason that you have gathered us?

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said: &#8216;The son of Adam tells a lie against Me,, though he hasn&#8217;t the right to do so. He abuses me though he hasn&#8217;t the right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is his saying that I will not recreate him as I created him for the first time. In fact, the first creation was not easier for Me than new creation. As for his abusing Me, it is his saying that Allah has begotten children, while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master Whom all creatures need, I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none like unto Me.&#8221;</p>

His telling a lie against Me is his saying that I will not recreate him as I created him for the first time; and his abusing Me is his saying that Allah has begotten children, while I am the self-sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, Who begets not nor was He begotten, and there is none like unto Me.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 500:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zirr bin Hubaish:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b regarding the two Muwwidhat (Surats of taking refuge with Allah). He said, &#8220;I asked the Prophet about them, He said, &#8216;These two Surats have been recited to me and I have recited them (and are present in the Quran).&#8217; So, we say as Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (i.e., they are part of the Quran&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 501:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zirr bin Hubaish:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b, &#8220;O Abu AlMundhir! Your brother, Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said so-and-so (i.e., the two Mu&#8217;awwidh-at do not belong to the Quran).&#8221; Ubai said, &#8220;I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about them, and he said, &#8216;They have been revealed to me, and I have recited them (as a part of the Quran),&#8221; So Ubai added, &#8220;So we say as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against building Masjids over graves</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle">Fatwas of Ibn Baz :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was asked: Is it permissible to build a Masjid over the site of the People of the Cave? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, all praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article published in the third edition of the Islamic Sciences League magazine in the &#8220;Muslim News in a Month&#8221; section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Islamic Sciences League, in<span id="ContentParagraph"> The Hashemite Kingdom of <strong>Jordan</strong>, </span>intends to build a Masjid over the site of the cave recently discovered in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the village of Al-Rahib, </span>which is said to be the cave where <span id="ContentParagraph">the People of the Cave </span>mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an slept</span>.</span> End Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is my duty to advise for the sake of Allah and His servants, I thought it would be beneficial to say a word in the same magazine of the Islamic Sciences League published in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </span>I must <strong>admonish</strong> the league to give up the intention of building a Masjid over the site of this cave, mainly and solely for the reason that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">building Masjids over the graves and remains of the Prophets and righteous people is utterly forbidden by the Shari`ah (Islamic law) and that those who do so are cursed</span></strong>. This is because such an act <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>may lead to Shirk</strong></span> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">excessive veneration and over praising of the prophets and pious people</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality bears witness to the validity of the texts of the Shari`ah and proves that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and provides decisive proof of the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down to him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk, excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk</span>. One of the outstanding virtues of Shari`ah is to forbid building of Masjids over graves and to warn sternly against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Shaykhs,<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>(may Allah be merciful to them), narrated some Hadiths to this effect on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="MayAllahcursetheJewsandthe"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">`Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#339966;">He warned against what they did and had it not been for this, his grave would have been raised above the ground but he feared that it would be taken as a Masjid</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim that <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="UmSalamahandUmHabibah(may"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"> </span><span id="ContentParagraph" style="color:#339966;">Um Salamah and Um Habibah (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in which there were pictures. When they told the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this, he said, &#8216;When a pious person among these people died they built a place of worship over his grave and painted these pictures therein. They will be the worst of creation in the Sight of Allah</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in Sahih<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) five days before his death, stating: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="IstandfreeofblamebeforeAllah"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph"></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths in this regard. Imams of Muslim scholars from the four Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) and others have stated the prohibition of building Masjids over graves. They issued the sternest warning against doing so, urging Muslims to observe the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and advising this Ummah lest it should fall into the same excessiveness and veneration of the prophets and pious people the way its predecessors from the extremist<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Christians </span>and their like who deviated from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is incumbent upon the Islamic Sciences League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jordan </span>and Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah and the way of the righteous Imams, and to be cautious not to commit what Allah and His Messenger warned against. It is the only way that leads to people&#8217;s uprightness and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. <span style="color:#ff6600;">It should be noted that some people formed their opinions based on the misinterpretation of Allah&#8217;s Statement in the story<span id="ContentParagraph"> of the People of the Cave: </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 21" target="_blank" name="AndthusWemadetheircaseknown"></a>(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): “We verily shall build a place of worship over them.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is that Allah (Praised and Exalted be He) informed us about the rulers and prominent people who announced this statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He told their story not by of expressing content and agreement with what they said, but rather as a kind of dispraise and expressing abhorrence of their action</strong></span>. This is even indicated by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to whom this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) was revealed and was the most knowledgeable of its interpretation, for he forbade his Ummah from building Masjids over the graves and cursed and dispraised those who do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this had been permissible, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have strongly affirmed its prohibition to the extent of cursing those who did it, or describing them as the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This should be sufficient in pointing out the gravity implied in the matter and providing a convincing answer to those who seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if we supposed that building Masjids over graves was permissible for those who preceded us, still we are not permitted to follow their example because the Shari`ah (Islamic law) abrogates all previous laws, and our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Last of the Messengers and the Shari`ah revealed to him is comprehensive</strong>. He (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and as such, we are not permitted to disobey him. We must follow his example and adhere to his Sunnah and abandon what contradicts it regarding the previous Shari`ahs (Divine laws) and favorable customs followed by some people, because Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is perfect and comprehensive and no guidance is better than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the One Whom we invoke to grant all Muslims and us success and to keep us firm on the truth and help us adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) in words and deeds, whether manifested or hidden, and in all our daily affairs until we meet Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah is the All-Hearer, Ever-Near and Responsive. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Tafseer of Sooratun-Nabaa` (78)<br />
</span>Compiled by Dr. Saalih as-Saalih</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah, we praise Him, and seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah, Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whoever Allaah guides, there is none who can musguide him, whoever Allaah allows to be misguided cannot be guided. I testify that there is no true God worthy of being worshipped except Allaah, alone, without partner or associate. I further testify that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)(1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah&#8217;s Salaah and Salaam be also granted to the Prophet&#8217;s pure family, and to all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> &#8220;O you believe! Fear Allaah [by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He forbade] as He should feared [Obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always] and die not except in a state of Islaam (as Muslims with complete submission to Allaah).&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah Al-i&#8217;Imraan (3) Ayat 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> &#8220;O mankind! Be dutiful to you Rabb (Allaah) (2), Who created you from a single person (Aadam) and from him (Aadam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both He created many men and women and fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allaah is ever an All-Watcher over you.&#8221; </em></strong> [Surah an-Nisa&#8217; (4) Ayat 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> &#8220;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great success.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Ahzaab (33) Ayat 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It proceeds then: That the most truthful speech is that of Allaah&#8217;s Book (the Qur&#8217;aan) and that the best of guidance is that of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The worst of evils are innovation (foreign to the true teachings of Islaam). Every innovated matter (in religion) is a Bid&#8217;ah; every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalaalah (misguidance), and every Dalaalah is in the Fire of Hell. The Qur&#8217;aan is the Word of Allaah. The Tafseer (Exegesis) of the meaning of the Noble Ayat (verses) of the Qur&#8217;aan is critical to the understanding of Islaam as a whole. The Qur&#8217;aan is explained by the Qur&#8217;aan itself (3) and by the Sunnah (4) of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The Salaf (5) not only transmitted the explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan, but laid down the foundations for Ijitihaad (6) and thus their way is the best and most reliable way of Tafseer. Philosophical and scholastic opinions dealing with the Word of Allaah produce confusion, alterations in the meaning of the texts and thus lead astray. The Muslim is called to follow the path of those who gained Allaah&#8217;s Pleasure. They are the Salaf, may Allaah make us follow their path in all matters of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Considering the above, I have decided to bring closer the Salaf&#8217;s Tafseer in separate publications starting with the Tafseer of Part Thirty of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. This is the second issue and it deals with the Tafseer of Surah an-Naazi&#8217;aat. I hope that this approach will be simple enough so that it will, Inshaa&#8217; Allaah, benefit a board sector of the Muslim Ummah (Nation). I ask Allaah to accept this effort and make it beneficial for all those who read it and (or) distribute it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  The Tafseer of Surah an-Naba&#8217; (7)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  1 &#8211; &#8220;What are they asking (one another)?&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 2 &#8211; &#8220;About the Great News.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelievers question the occurence of the Day of Reckoning. Allaah (SWT (8)) describes this Day as the one that brings Great News. Ibin Katheer (The eminent scholar of Tafseer) said that most likely this News refers to the Resurrection after death, based upon the fact that Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says about it in the next ayah (verse):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  3 &#8211; &#8220;About which they are in disagreement.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind are divided to believers and disbelievers regarding the occurence of this Day. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) warns those who deny it, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  4 &#8211; &#8220;Nay, they will come to know!&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 5 &#8211; &#8220;Nay, again, they will come to know!&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An emphasised and a confirmed warning for those who deny this Day that they will certainly come to know that the Day of Resurrection is true. Allaah shows His abilities to produce the Signs of this Day and He tells about its magnitude in the following verses so that the people contemplate and realise that Allaah, Who is able to bring about these Signs, is All-Able to bring life to the Dead as well as Resurrection. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) tells mankind about many aspects of His Ability and Power to create what He wishes. For those who under-estimate Allaah and His Greatness, there is a reminder, and for those who believe, there is an affirmation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  6 &#8211; &#8220;Have We (9) not made the earth as a bed?&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 7 &#8211; &#8220;And the mountains as pegs?&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To provide cohesiveness and stability to the earth. Modern scientific discoveries found that these pegs are driven into the ground like pegs used to anchor a tent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  8 &#8211; &#8220;And We have created you in pairs.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Males and females, tall and short, good and bad etc. Males and females lawfully enjoy each other (through marriage) and have children. This enjoyment is physical as well as emotional. it provides mercy and morally abiding friendship. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says in other Ayah in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;And among His signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves that you may find repose in them and He has put between them affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed Signs for a people who reflect.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah ar-Room (30) Ayat 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  9 &#8211; &#8220;And have made your sleep as a thing for rest.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sleep discontinues the motion at the end of the day. A resting time for human efforts seekins sustenance. This is just one other Mercy of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 10 &#8211; &#8220;And have made the night as a covering (through its darkness).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The darkness covers you just as your garment covers your body. The &#8220;covering&#8221; night produces a quiet environment to reside in and to become still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  11 &#8211; &#8220;And have made the day for livelihood.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah produced shining light in it (from the Sun) so that people can manage their affairs and function to produce their livelihood which He (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) has already ordained for each individual in appropiate measures. In another Ayah, Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;It is out of His Mercy that He has put for you night and day, that you may rest therein (i.e. during the night) and that you may seek of His Bounty (i.e. during the day), and in order that you may be grateful.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Qasas (28) Ayat 73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  Who, other than the Creator of Day and Night can balance their respective course of time?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> &#8220;Say (O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)): Tell me! If Allaah made night continuous for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god besides Allaah who bring you light? Will you not then hear?&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Qasas (28) Ayat 71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;Say (O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)): Tell me! If Allaah made day continuous for you till the Day of Resurrection who is a god besides Allaah who could bring you night wherein you rest? Will you then not see?&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Qasas (28) Ayat 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  12 &#8211; &#8220;And We have built above you seven strong (heavens).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seven, wide, high, firmly constructed, beautifully constructed, beautifully built without supporting columns. Beautified with stars, planets, the sun and the moon. The sun as a shining lamp:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  13 &#8211; &#8220;And have made (therein) a Shining Lamp.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;Lamp&#8221; illuminates the whole universe to provide light as well as heat allowing growth, energy, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  14 &#8211; &#8220;And We have sent down from the rainy clouds abudant water.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah beautifully explains in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;Allaah is He Who sends the winds, so they raise clouds and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then breaks them into fragments until you see rain drops come forth from their midst! Then when He has made them fall on whom of His slaves as He wills, lo! They rejoice!&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah ar-Room (30) Ayat 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefits of water are remarkable:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  15 &#8211; &#8220;That We may produce therewith corn and vegetations.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eaten by man and animals and used in various useful means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 16 &#8211; &#8220;And gardens of thick growth.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With different fruits, fragrance, tastes, smells produced in one single piece of land! This is similar to another Ayah where Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;And in the earth are neighbouring tracts and gardens of vines, and fields sown with corn, and palm trees, growing out two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise (one stem root for every palm), watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Verily in these things are Ayat (signs, proofs, evidences, lessons) for the people who understand.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13) Ayat 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the above Favours of Allaah are so vivid. How could the disbelievers make use of all of these bounties and yet deny the Resurrection? Then comes the realities: O! man don&#8217;t forget that there is an appointed term for everything:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  17 &#8211; &#8220;Verily the Day of Decision is a fixed time&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This time does not increase nor decrease nor it is to be postponed, and no one knows its specific occurrence except Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala). He says about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  18 &#8211; &#8220;The Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and you shall come forth in crowds (groups).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each Ummah (nation) will come with its respective Imams, as Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says in another Ayah in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;(And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imams (their prophets, or their Holy Books like the Qur&#8217;aan, the Torah, the Gospel, or their Records of good and bad deeds, etc.)&#8221; </em></strong> [Surah al-Isra&#8217; (17) Ayat 71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Bukhari relates that Abu Hurayrah (RA) said that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <em>&#8220;Between the two sounds of the trumpet there will be Forty.&#8221; Somebody asked Abu Hurayrah, &#8220;Forty days?&#8221; But he refused to reply. Then he asked, &#8220;Forty Months?&#8221; He refused to reply. Abu Hurayrah added &#8220;Then (after this period) Allaah will send water from the sky and then the dead bodies will grow like vegetation grows, there is nothing of the human body that does not decay except one bone; that is the little bone at the end of the coccyx of which the human body will be recreated on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</em> (10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  19 &#8211; &#8220;And the heaven shall be opened, and it will become as gates.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allowing the passage of descending angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  20 &#8211; &#8220;And the mountains shall be moved away from their places and they will be as if they were a mirage.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to the saying of Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) in another Ayah of the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;And you will see the mountains and think them solid, but they shall pass away as the passing away of the clouds. The Work of Allaah, Who Perfected all things, verily! He is All-Acquainted with what you do.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah an-Naml (27) Ayat 88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> &#8220;And they ask you concerning the mountains, say: My Rabb will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust&#8230;&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah Ta-Ha (20) Ayat 105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;And the day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust)! and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Kahf (18) Ayat 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People think when they see the mountains that it mounts to something, yet it is nothing, and it will completely vanish without any remains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  21 &#8211; &#8220;Truly Hell is a place of ambush,&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 22 &#8211; &#8220;A dwelling place for at-Tagh&#8217;een:&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tagheen: Those who transgress the boundary limits set by Allaah like the Kuffar (disbelievers), Mushriks (worshipping other than Allaah), hypocrites, sinners, criminals, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  23 &#8211; &#8220;They will abide therein Ahqaba.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahqaba (pl. Huqq&#8217;b) (i.e. for ages): One after the other forever as related by Qutadah, Al-Hassan al-Basri and other prominent scholars of the Salaf. Most of them mentioned that each Huqq&#8217;b is eighty (80) years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  24 &#8211; &#8220;Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No cooling their hearts shall they find in Hell, nor a good drink to quit their thirst. That is why Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  25 &#8211; &#8220;Except boiling water, and dirty wound discharges (i.e. pus, etc.)&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dark fluid is a festering water from the sweat, tears and wounds of the people of Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  26 &#8211; &#8220;An exact recompense (according to their evil crimes).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is All-Just. His punishment is All-Just. They will be punished because:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  27 &#8211; &#8220;For verily, they used not to look for a reckoning.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They did not believe that everything will return to Allaah and, therefore, they did not prepare for this Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  28 &#8211; &#8220;But they belied our Ayaat completely.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations together with the guidance shown to them by Allaah&#8217;s Messengers, were faced with rejection and denial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  29 &#8211; &#8220;And all things We have recorded in a BOOK.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) had known all the deeds of His slaves and had written them all in a BOOK long before mankind was created. He decreed reward and punishment. There is no sin more grave than Shirk (setting up rivals with Allaah in worship). Those who commit Shirk have an ill opinion about Allaah. Justly, they shall receive an eternal punishment and that is Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 30 &#8211; &#8220;So taste you (the results of your evil actions): No increase shall We give you except in Torment.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It will be said to the people of Hell: taste what you are suffering. We shall not grant you an increase except similar torment and so it shall progressively multiply. It is related that Abdullaah Ibin Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: &#8220;Allaah did not bring down on the people of fire an Ayah more severe than this Ayah.&#8221; He said they will be forever in a state of progressive increase in torment, and Allaah is All-Just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  What about those who fear Allaah and accept the Message of Tawheed?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) describes in the following Ayat some of their conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  31 &#8211; &#8220;Verily for the Mut&#8217;taqeen there will be success (</em></strong><strong><em> Paradise</em></strong><strong><em> ).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mut&#8217;taqeen are those pious and rigtheous persons who fear Allaah, worship none except Him (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) and do righteous deeds. They will end up in:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  32 &#8211; &#8220;Gardens and grapeyards.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 33 &#8211; &#8220;And young full-breasted (mature) maidens of equal age.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are young virgin women whose breasts are firm (steady on their chests) and not loose as the breasts of women of this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  34 &#8211; &#8220;And a full cup (of wine).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Akrama (a great scholar of Tafseer) said that the wine of Paradise is clear. The resemblance to the wine is only in name. It does not cause any loss of conscious nor stomach pai and its taste and smell are good, unlike the wine of this life. In another ayah in the Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine; White, delicious to the drinkers, Neither they will have Ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, a sin, etc.) form that, nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah as-Saffaat (37) Ayat 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are rivers of this kind of wine in Paradise :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;Rivers of wine delicious to those who drink.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah Muhammad (47) Ayat 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wine of this world is prohibited because of its known evil effects on the individuals as well as the society. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <em>&#8220;He who drinks wine in this world would be deprived of it in the Hereafter, unless he repents.&#8221; </em>(11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  35 &#8211; &#8220;No Falsehood shall they hear therein, nor lying.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the place of peace, nothing in it is deficient. As Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says in the another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;No vain speaking will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech (like backbiting, etc.), but only the saying of Salaam! Salaam! (Greeting with peace).&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Waaqi&#8217;ah (56) Ayat 25-26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these Favours are from Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 36 &#8211; &#8220;A Reward from your Rabb, a Sufficient Gift.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> 37 &#8211; &#8220;(From) the Rabb of the Heavens and the Earth, and whatsoever is in between them, the Most Beneficient. None can dare to speak with Him (on the Day of Resurrection, except with His leave).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) tells us about His Greatness and Majesty and that He is the Rabb of the Heavens and the Earth and all that is between them. That He is the Most Beneficient whose Mercy encompasses everything. No one has the right or power to argue with Alaah about anything. He is above all creation. He may permit those who plead in truth and righteousness but only after His permission is granted as He (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;Who is He that can intercede with Him except with His permission?&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Baqarah (2) Ayat 255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  38 -&#8220;The Day that the Ruh and the angels will stand forth in rows none shall speak except him whom the Beneficient (Allaah) allows and he will speak what is right.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibin Katheer, May Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, mentioned sevens sayings about the meaning of the Ruh (Spirit): a) Jibreel, b) Speacial servants of Allaah other than the angels, c) The souls of the children of Aadam standing forth in ranks, d) Special creation of Allaah having the form of the children of Aadam yet they are not angels nor humans but they eat and drink, e) A special great angel, f) The Children of Aadam and g) The Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibin Katheer, supports the opinion that the Spririt may be the children of Aadam. Shaykh Muhammad Ameen ash-Shanqiti (may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him) in his famous book of Tafseer, known as Adwaa&#8217; ul Bayaan (12) said that the evidence from the Qur&#8217;aan indicates that &#8220;the Spirit is the Special Angel Jibreel.&#8221; He cites as reference, the ayah about the descension of the angels in the Night of al-Qadar in the month of Ramadaan. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;Therein descend the angels and the Ruh (Jibreel) by Allaah&#8217;s Permission with all decrees.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Qadr (97) Ayat 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ruh is Ma&#8217;toufah i.e. grammatically in conjuction with &#8220;the angels&#8221; in the above ayah, thus indicating that the Ruh is the Speacial Angel Jibreel, and Allaah knows best. May other Mufassir&#8217;roon (people of Tafseer) support the conclusion that the Ruh in the above ayah is Jibreel. Others limit the Ruh to a Great Special Angel (13). Ibin Jareer at-Tabari, in his Tafseer known as Tafseer at-Tabari (14) said that, &#8220;&#8230;the meanings mentioned (see above), yet Allaah knows best which one it is. There is no information that specifies that any particular one of these things (mentioned above) is the one which is meant in the ayah (#38, above), and that there is no supportive evidence (i.e. for any particular meaning). Ignorance about this matter is not, therefore, harmful.&#8221; Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Resurrection, only those whom Allaah permits to speak or intercede will do so. They will speak the truth which is the witnessing of the Tawheed of Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala): There is no true God who deserves to be worshipped except Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  39 -&#8220;That is the True Day (they denied): so whoever wills, let him take a return to his Rabb.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A straight return to Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) by obeying Him in this worldly life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  40 &#8211; &#8220;Verily! We have warned you of near Tormet, the Day when man will see that (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth and the disbeliever will say: &#8216;Woe to me! Would that I were dust!&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) says in other ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> &#8220;And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Rabb treats no one with injustice.&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Kahf (18) Ayat 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>  &#8220;On that Day man will be informed what he sent forward (of his evil or good deeds), and what he left behind (of his good or evil traditions).&#8221;</em></strong> [Surah al-Qiyaamah (75) Ayat 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that Day, the disbeliever wishes that he was mere dust in this worldly life and that he was not even created. This is when he sees the torment that Allaah had prepared for him and when he examines his deeds written and recorded by the angels. It is explained also that he wishes to be a mere dust when Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) judges between the animal creation. There when Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) will make judgement for the hornless sheep against the horned sheep. After which He (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) will order the animals to be dust and it changes to dust. When this happens, the disbeliever wishes he was dust (i.e. he was an animal)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this latter explanation was related in a Hadeeth by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): <em>&#8220;The claimants would get their claims on the Day of Resurrection so much so that the hornless sheep would get its claim from the horned sheep.&#8221; </em>(15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  Summary</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Surah, the Great News, affirms the Day of Reckoning and provides a beautiful as well as a terrifying illustration for what happens on that Day. These are facts and ayah from Allaah for those who contemplate. May Allaah guide us to re-examine our stand in this life in relation to His decrees and aim to comply with command. Ameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Advice: Read the surah with family members, a friend, give a copy of it to someone around you and if you remember the person who compiled the Tafseer of this Surah&#8230;don&#8217;t forget to ask Allaah to forgive him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Salla Allaahu Aleihi Wasallam: The Salaah and Salaam of Allaah be upon His Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The Salaah of Allaah upon Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is His praise of the Prophet to the angels who are close to (but below) Allaah, the Most High, who arose above His &#8216;Arsh (Throne) which is above the seven skies. The angels also praise him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The Salaam is Allaah&#8217;s safeguarding of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from defeciencies and any kind of evil. When the Muslims says Salla Allaahu Aleihi Wasallam, he invokes Allaah to grant Praise and Security to the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). See Ibnul Qayyim&#8217;s Jallaa&#8217;ul Afhaam Fee Fadlis-Salaati-wa-Salaam &#8216;Alaa Muhammadin Kairil &#8216;Anaam, p.128. Published by Daar ibn Katheer, Damascus , and Maktabat Daar At-Turaath, Al-Madeenah, 1408HJ/1988.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Rabb: Allaah is ar-Rabb: He is the One Who gave all things the power to grow, to move and to change, to Whom belongs the Creation and the Commandment, The Master Who has no equal in His Sovereignty, Predominance, and Highness, The One Who Provides and Sustains all that exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Some Ayat in some Surahs (Chapters) are clearly understood in light of other ayat in other parts of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Sunnah: includes the sayings, explanations, rulings, recommendations, advice, approvals, actions and teachings by the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) pertaining to all matters of Islaam. The Sunnah is an Inspiration from Allaah as stated in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nor does he (Muhammad) speak of (his own) desire. It is only an Inspiration that is inspired.&#8221; Surah an-Najm (53) Ayat 3-4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Comprises the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and those who follow their path in understanding Islaam up to the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Ijitihaad: Deducing the meaning of certain texts (or rulings) where there is no clear proof from the Qur&#8217;aan and (or) the Sunnah. The essentials of this Islaamic science is still based, however, on relevant texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and (or) Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Say it is the Qur&#8217;aan that Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) sent down to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) which calls mankind to the believe in the Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed) and informs about Death and Resurrection. The disbelievers disputed about Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the Message that was Revealed to Him. They questioned: What is he reciting? where did he bring this Qur&#8217;aan. Some said it is magic, others said it is poetry and some considered it stories from the past! They asked each other many questions, including questions about the Day of Reckoning! Allaah Revealed: &#8220;What are they asking (one another)!&#8221; &#8211; THE GREAT NEWS.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. SWT: Subhanahu Wata&#8217;la, Most Glorified &amp; Most High, He is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. One may notice that sometimes Allaah Who is One refers to Himself by We or Us. This is not an indication of different &#8220;personalities&#8221; or &#8220;forms&#8221; of Allaah as it is the case in the Trinity concept of the Catholic Church. Allaah (God) is One. The use of We and Us is always associated with verses referring to Allaah&#8217;s Greatness in His Lordship e.g. Creation, Power, Might, etc&#8230; This is very common in the Arabic Language. a king issues orders or statements by saying &#8220;We&#8221; or &#8220;Us&#8221;. The Power and might of any king is imperfect. Allaah Glorification of Himself is Perfect because He is Perfect. In His address to mankind by calling them to direct their worship to Him, Allaah always refers to Himself by I, Me and Myself. All of this is well understood in Arabic and also in other Semetic languages. Even in English, there is the &#8220;Royal We and Us&#8221; as we hear it from statements by members of the Royal Family in England and elsewhere. To Allaah, however, belongs the Best Examples, Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-are-we-obligated-to-interpret-the-noble-quraan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Here is complete book</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Question:</b> How are we obligated to interpret the noble Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Answer:</b> Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, sent the Qur’aan down to the heart of His Messenger Muhammad in order to bring mankind from out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance to the light of Islaam. Allaah says: <b>“Alif-Laam-Raa. This is a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you may lead mankind from out of the darkness (of disbelief) into the light (of Islaam), by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy.”</b> [Surah Ibraaheem: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He placed His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) to clarify, interpret and explain what is in the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“And We revealed to you (O Muhammad), the Reminder (i.e. the Sunnah), in order for you to explain to mankind what was (already) revealed to them, and so that they may reflect.”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah came in order to explain and clarify what is found in the noble Qur’aan, and it is (also) a revelation sent by Allaah, as He says: <b>&#8220;And he (i.e. Muhammad) does not speak from his own desire. Rather, it is just revelation that is revealed to him.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“I was indeed given the Qur’aan and something similar to it along with it. It is imminent that there will come a time where a man who has eaten to his full will recline on his couch and say: ‘Stick to the Qur’aan. Whatever you find in it that is Halaal (lawful), then declare it lawful. And whatever you find in it that is Haraam (unlawful), then declare it unlawful!’ Whereas, whatever Allaah’s Messenger made unlawful is just like what Allaah made unlawful.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first source that must be used to interpret the noble Qur’aan is the Qur’an (itself) along with the Sunnah, which consists of the Prophet’s statements, actions and silent approvals. Then after that, it must be interpreted using the interpretations (tafseer) of the people of knowledge, at the head of whom are the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And the foremost amongst the Companions with regard to this subject (tafseer) is ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>). This is due to several factors, one being that he was one of the first to accompany the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) (i.e. accept Islaam), and another being that he (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) would give strong emphasis to asking about, understanding, and interpreting the Qur’aan. Then after him comes ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), about whom ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>“He is the interpreter (turjumaan) of the Qur’aan.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after them, any Companion whose interpretation (tafseer) of an ayah can be authentically confirmed – and there exists no difference of opinion amongst the Companions regarding it, we accept this interpretation (tafseer) from him with full contentment, submission and reliance. And if no such tafseer can be found (from the Companions) regarding a particular ayah, then we take its tafseer from the Taabi’een, particularly those who specialized in studying tafseer under the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), such as Sa’eed bin Jubair, Taawoos and others who are well known for their studying of tafseer under some of the Companions, particularly Ibn ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), as we mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, there are some ayaat that are interpreted according to a certain opinion or madh-hab (school of Jurisprudence), and for which no direct explanation from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) can be found. So because of this, some latter-day individuals relied solely on applying such ayahs according to their madh-hab in order to interpret them. And this is an extremely dangerous matter – where ayaat are interpreted in order to support one’s madh-hab and (personal) views – whereas the scholars of tafseer have interpreted these verses in a different way than the adherents of these madhaahib have interpreted them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps, we should mention an example of this, which is Allaah’s statement: <b>“So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan.”</b> [Surah Al-Muzammil: 20] Some of the adherents of certain madhaahib have interpreted this ayah to refer to just the recitation itself, meaning: What is obligatory to recite from the Qur’aan in all of the prayers is just one long ayah or three short ayaat. They said this in spite of there being reported the authentic hadeeth from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“There is no prayer for the one who doesn’t recite the opening chapter (Faatihah) of the Book (Qur’aan).”</b> And in another hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever performs a prayer in which he doesn’t recite the opening chapter of the Book, then it is deficient, deficient, deficient, and not complete.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basis of proof indicated in these two hadeeths is rejected by the afore-mentioned interpretation of the above ayah, which is that the ayah refers to the recitation of the Qur’aan in general. And according to them, it is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan except with the Sunnah that came in mutawaatir[1] form – meaning it is not permitted to interpret the mutawaatir except with the mutawaatir. So because of this, they rejected the two previously mentioned hadeeth due to their relying on their opinion or madh-hab for the interpretation of this ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, all of the scholars of tafseer, past and present, have explained that the meaning of the noble ayah <b>“So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan”</b> is: “So pray what is easy for you from the Night Prayer (Tahajjud).” This is since Allaah mentioned this part of the ayah in connection to His saying (i.e. the complete ayah): <b>“Verily, your Lord knows that you stand (to pray at night) a little less than two thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and also a party of those with you. And Allaah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to pray the entire night, so He has turned to you (in mercy). So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan.”</b> [Surah Al-Muzammil: 20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last part means: “So pray what is easy for you from the Night Prayer (Tahajjud).” Therefore, the ayah is not in reference to what a person is obligated to recite specifically during the night prayer. Rather, (in this ayah), Allaah facilitates for the Muslims to pray what they are able to perform from the Night Prayer. This means that they are not obligated to pray what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) used to pray, which was eleven rak’aat, as you are aware of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning of the ayah. It is phrased in an Arabic style of “applying a portion, by which the whole is intended.” Thus, Allaah’s statement: <b>“So recite”</b> means <b>“So pray.”</b> The prayer is the whole, while the recitation (in prayer) is the portion. The purpose of this phrasing is to clarify the importance of this portion with respect to that whole. Another example of this is Allaah’s statement: <b>“Perform the prayer from midday until the darkness of the night (Dhuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Ishaa), and (also) the (recitation of the) Qur’aan of Fajr (dawn).”</b> [Surah Al-Israa: 78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <b>“the Qur’aan of Fajr”</b> is “the Fajr Prayer.” So in this situation also, the portion is applied but the whole is intended. This is a style in the Arabic Language that is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after showing the interpretation of this ayah from the scholars of tafseer, without there being any difference of opinion amongst the past and present from them, it is not permissible to reject the first and second hadeeths (mentioned previously), claiming that they are ahead, and that it is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan with ahaad hadeeth! This is since the afore-mentioned ayah was interpreted by the statements of the scholars who are knowledgeable of the language of the Qur’aan. This is first, and secondly, it is because the hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>)(<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) does not contradict the Qur’aan, but rather, it explains and clarifies it, as we explained in the beginning of this discussion. How can this be when this ayah has no relation to the subject of what a Muslim is obligated to recite during prayer, regardless of whether it is an obligatory or recommended prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the two afore-mentioned hadeeths, then it is clear that they both are on the subject of a person’s prayer not being valid unless he recites Surah Al-Faatihah in it: <b>“There is no prayer for the one who doesn’t recite the opening chapter (Faatihah) of the Book (Qur’aan)”</b> and <b>“Whoever performs a prayer in which he doesn’t recite the opening chapter of the Book, then it is deficient, deficient, deficient, and not complete.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the prayer is defective. So whoever finishes his prayer while it is deficient, then he in fact didn’t pray at all. And his prayer at this point becomes invalid, as is apparent in the first hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this reality becomes clear to us, we must therefore feel secure with the ahaadeeth that come to us from the Prophet, which are reported in the books of Sunnah, firstly, and with their authentic chains of narration, secondly. And we must have no doubts or uncertainties about them due to some philosophical approach to the ahaadeeth, which we hear about in current times, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We only accept the ahaad ahaadeeth on issues regarding rulings, and not for issues regarding creed. This is since matters of creed cannot be established based on ahaad ahaadeeth.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what they claim! Yet we know for a fact that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) sent Mu’aadh (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) to call the People of the Scripture to believe in Tawheed, and he was just one individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief discussion is sufficient with regard to this topic that I wanted to clarify, which is related to: How are we obligated to interpret the Noble Qur’aan?</p>

<td>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Last two Ayah of Surat ul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Muhammad ) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maulâ (Patron, Suppor-ter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Virtue of These Ayah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbas &#8221; who said:<br />
&#8220;While Jibra&#8217;eel (Gibrael) &#8221; `May Peace be upon him&#8217; was sitting with the Prophet !, he heard the opening of a gate above him. So he raised his head and said: `This is a gate from the shies that has opened today, which has never opened before this day.&#8217; So an angel descended from it (the gate). So he Jibra&#8217;eel &#8221; said: &#8220;This is an angel that has descended to the earth, which has never descended except today. He gave Salam and said: &#8216;Receive glad tidings [Oh Muhammad ! with two lights which have been given to you, that have never been given to a Prophet before you: The Opening of the Book (i.e. Surat Al- Fatihah) and the end of Surat Al-Baqarah. Never do you read a letter from either of the two (Surahs) except that you are given it.( Which means that you are given its reward (i.e. the reward of recitation)) (Reported by Muslim) (Taken from Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim with Shaykh AI-Albani&#8217;s editing, p.553, Hadith no. 2094.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, each of the believers believes that Allah is the One and Only and the Sustainer, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him and there is no Lord except Him. The believers also believe in all Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah&#8217;s leave. Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad&#8217;s Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his Ummah will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey&#8221;) means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, mercy and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah&#8217;s kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself &#8211; or passing thoughts &#8211; they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one&#8217;s mind is a part of faith. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He gets reward for that which he has earned) of good,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he is punished for that which he has earned) of evil, that is, concerning the acts that one is responsible for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said, [mentioning what the believers said] while directing His servants to supplicate to Him, all the while promising them that He will answer their supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Push us not if we forget or fall into error,&#8221;) meaning, &#8220;If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.&#8221; We mentioned the Hadith by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is also the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians),) means, &#8220;Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad , the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the Hanifi (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.&#8221; Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is the Hadith recorded through various chains of narration that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah way.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear) </strong>of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication)&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication),&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Pardon us) meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And grant us forgiveness) concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have mercy on us) in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. They say that those who commit error need three things: Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for what is between Him and them, that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and that He grants them immunity from further error.&#8221; We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You are our Mawla) meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people) those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet , worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. Allah said, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in the Hadith that Muslim collected from Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say &#8220;Amin.&#8221;</p>

His treatise &#8220;Ba&#8217;adu Fawaa&#8217;id Surat-il-Faatihah&#8221;<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1] All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] The Most merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Owner of the Day of Recompense</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three verses contain three matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Verse: </b>Consist of Love. This is since Allaah is the One who grants blessings, and the One who grants blessings is loved in accordance to His granting of blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Love is divided into four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Love: </b>The Polytheistic Type of Love: This applies to those about whom Allaah said: <b>“And amongst mankind are those who take rivals apart from Allaah, loving them like the love that is due to Allaah…”</b> up to where He said: <b>“And they will not be able to get out from the Fire.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Love: </b>Love for falsehood and its adherents while having hatred for the truth and its adherents. This is the characteristic of the hypocrites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Love: </b>The Natural Type of Love: This applies to love for wealth and children. If such things do not preoccupy one from obeying Allaah or assist in disobeying Allaah, then they are allowable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Love: </b>Love for the adherents of Tawheed (monotheism) and hatred for the adherents of Shirk (polytheism). This is the strongest handhold of Faith and the greatest thing a servant can worship his Lord by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Verse: </b>Contains Hope</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Verse: </b>Contains Fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“You alone do we worship…” </b>meaning: <b>“I worship You, O Lord, with what has preceded – i.e. the three things – with Love for You, Hope in You, and fear of You.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three things are the pillars of worship, and directing them to someone (or something) other than Allaah is Shirk (polytheism).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these three things is a refutation against those who cling onto just one from amongst them, such as those who cling onto only Love, or cling onto only Hope or cling onto only Fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever directs any of these three aspects to someone other than Allaah is a polytheist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst its benefits is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A refutation against the three groups, each of which sticks to one aspect apart from the others, as is the case with those who worship Allaah with only Love. And as is the case with those who worship Allaah with just Hope, such as the Murji’ah, and those who worship Allaah with just Fear, such as the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] You alone do we worship and in You alone do we seek assistance</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse contains the Oneness of Allaah in the Worship due to Him and the Oneness of Allaah in His Lordship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“You alone do we worship” </b>contains the Oneness of Allaah in the Worship due to Him, i.e. Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And in You alone do we seek assistance” </b>contains the Oneness of Allaah in His Lordship, i.e. Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5] Guide us to the Straight Path</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse consists of a refutation against the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the last two verses,[1] then from among its benefits is that Allaah mentions the (various) conditions of the people. Allaah has divided them into three categories: (1) Those whom Allaah has bestowed His Blessing on; (2) Those whom have gained Allaah’s Anger; and (3) Those who are astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who have gained Allaah’s Anger are the people who have knowledge but no actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who are astray are the people who perform worship but no knowledge with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the reason why this verse was revealed was with regard to the Jews and the Christians, it applies to everyone that characterizes himself with these attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category consists of those who are characterized with knowledge and action. They are the ones whom Allaah has bestowed His Blessing on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another of the benefits derived from this surah is that an individual is freeing himself from any power or might since he is the one who is having the blessings bestowed on him. This surah also presents a complete awareness of Allaah and negates all defects from Him, Blessed and Exalted. The surah also contains a person’s aware ness of his Lord and awareness of himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since if there is a Lord, then there must also be one who is governed. If there is one who grants mercy, then there must also be one who is shown mercy. If there is an owner, then there must be that which is owned. If there is a worshipper, then there must also be one that is worshipped. If there is one that is guided then there must be one that guides. If there is one who bestows blessings, then there must also be one who receives the blessings. If there is one who obtains anger, then there must also be one who is angry. And if there is one who is astray, then there must also be one who leads astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this surah consists of the Oneness of Allaah in His Worship and Lordship and a negation of deficiencies from Allaah. It also consists of the definition and pillars of worship. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Tafsir Ibn Kathir of </b><b>Surat</b><b> At-Talaq</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(Chapter &#8211; 65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَـحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah and count their `Iddah. And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord. And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave, except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>There is a Period during which Divorced Women remain in Their Homes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was addressed first in this Ayah, to honor him, even though his Ummah is also being addressed in Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , while she was menstruating. `Umar bin Al-Khattab mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Allah&#8217;s Messenger became angry and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا ثُمَّ يُمْسِكْهَا حَتْى تَطْهُرَ، ثُمَّ تَحِيضَ فَتَطْهُرَ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يُطَلِّقَهَا، فَلْيُطَلِّقْهَا طَاهِرًا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَمَسَّهَا، فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ بِهَا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Order him to take her back and keep her until she is clean from her menses, and then to wait until she gets her next period and becomes clean again. Then, if he wishes to divorce her, he can divorce her when she is clean from her menses, before he has sexual intercourse with her. This is the `Iddah which Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has fixed.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in several parts of his Sahih. Muslim collected this Hadith and his narration uses these words,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ اللهُ أَنْ يُطَلَّقَ لَهَا النِّسَاء»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This is the `Iddah which Allah has fixed for the women being divorced.) In his Sahih, Muslim has recorded a Hadith which is a more appropriate version from a narration of Ibn Jurayj who said that Abu Az-Zubayr informed him that he heard `Abdur-Rahman bin Ayman, the freed slave of `Azzah, questioning `Abdullah bin `Umar. And Abu Az-Zubayr heard the question, &#8220;What about a man who divorces his wife while she is still on her menses&#8221; `Abdullah answered, &#8220;During the time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife who was menstruating in the life time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger . So Allah&#8217;s Messenger said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let him take her back.) so she returned and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا طَهُرَتْ فَلْيُطَلِّقْ أَوْ يُمْسِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When she is pure, then either divorce or keep her.) `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited this Ayah: (ياأَيُّها النَّبِيُّ إِذا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّساءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهِنَّ) (O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) And `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah) He said, &#8220;Purity without intercourse.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Umar, `Ata&#8217;, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, Maymun bin Mihran and Muqatil bin Hayyan. It is also reported from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak.`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas about the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;He does not divorce her while she is on her menses nor while she is pure if he has had intercourse during that (purity). Rather, he leaves her until she has her menses and after the menses ends, then he divorces her once.&#8221; And `Ikrimah said about</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;The `Iddah is made up of clean- liness and the menstrual period.&#8221; So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant, or he does not due to having sex, or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not. This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce, one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated. The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended. One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant. As for the innovated divorce, it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses, or after the menses ends, has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her, even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not. There is a third type of divorce, which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces a young wife who has not begun to have menses, the wife who is beyond the age of having menses, and divorcing one&#8217;s wife before the marriage was consummated. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and count their `Iddah.) meaning, count for it and know its beginning and end, so that the `Iddah does not become prolonged for the woman and she cannot get married again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord.) in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Spending and Housing is up to the Husband during the Revocable `Iddah Period</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave,) meaning, during the duration of the `Iddah, she has the right to housing from her husband, as long as the `Iddah period continues. Therefore, the husband does not have the right to force her out of her house, nor is she allowed to leave his house, because she is still tied to the marriage contract. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah.) meaning that the divorced wife is not to abandon her husband&#8217;s house unless she commits Fahishah Mubayyinah, in which case, she vacates her husband&#8217;s house. For example, Fahishah Mubayyinah implies adultery, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Sa`id bin Hilal and others. Fahishah Mubayyinah implies disobeying her husband openly or when she abuses her husband&#8217;s family in words and actions, according to Ubay bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those are the set limits of Allah.) means, these are from His legislation and prohibitions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah,) meaning, whoever violates these limits, transgresses them and implements anything else besides them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then indeed he has wronged himself.) by doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Wisdom of `Iddah at the Husband&#8217;s House</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) meaning, `We commanded that the divorced wife remains in her husband&#8217;s house during the `Iddah period, so that the husband might regret his action and Allah decides that the husband feels in his heart for the marriage to continue.&#8217; This way, returning to his wife will be easier for him. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah said that Fatimah bint Qays said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) &#8220;Taking her back.&#8221; Similar was said by Ash-Sha`bi, `Ata&#8217;, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ath-Thawri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocably Divorced Woman does not have a Right to Provisions and Accommodations from the Husband</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here the view of the scholars of the Salaf and those who follow them is that housing is not obligatory in the case of the irrevocably divorced woman. They also relied on the Hadith of Fatimah bint Qays Al-Fihriyah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her the third and final time. He was away from her in Yemen at the time, and he sent her his decision to divorce her. He also sent some barley with his messenger, but she did not like the amount or method of compensation. He said, &#8220;By Allah I am not obligated to spend upon you.&#8221; So, she went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَيْسَ لَكِ عَلَيْهِ نَفَقَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no obligation on him to spend on you.) Muslim added in his narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor housing.) And he ordered her to finish her `Iddah period in the house of Umm Sharik. He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«تِلْكَ امْرَأَةٌ يَغْشَاهَا أَصْحَابِي، اعْتَدِّي عِنْدَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ، فَإِنَّهُ رَجُلٌ أَعْمَى تَضَعِينَ ثِيَابَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(She is a woman my Companions visit. Spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man; [he cannot see you if] you take off your garments.) Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using another chain of narration. In his narration, the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«انْظُرِي يَا بِنْتَ آلِ قَيْسٍ إِنَّمَا النَّفَقَةُ وَالسُّكْنَى لِلْمَرْأَةِ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا، مَا كَانَتْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ فَلَا نَفَقَةَ وَلَا سُكْنَى،اخْرُجِي فَانْزِلِي عَلَى فُلَانَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Look O daughter of the family of Qays! Spending and housing are required from the husband who can return to his wife. So if he does not have the right to return to her, then she does not have the right to spending and housing. So leave his house and go to so-and-so woman.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّهُ يُتَحَدَّثُ إِلَيْهَا، انْزِلِي عَلَى ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْمَى لَا يَرَاك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They speak to her. Therefore, go to Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and cannot see you.) Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that `Amir Ash-Sha`bi went to Fatimah bint Qays, sister of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, from the tribe of Quraysh. Fatimah was married to Abu `Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mughirah, from Bani Makhzum. She said, &#8220;Abu `Amr bin Hafs sent me his decision to divorce me while he was in an army that had gone to Yemen. I asked his friends to provide me with financial provisions and housing. They said, `He did not send us anything for that, nor did he request it from us.&#8217; I went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said to him, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced me, and I asked his friends to provide me with spending and housing and they said that he did not send them anything for that.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّمَا السُّكْنَى وَالنَّفَقَةُ لِلْمَرْأَةِ إِذَا كَانَ لِزَوْجِهَا عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ حَتْى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ:فَلَا نَفَقَةَ لَهَا وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Spending and housing are required from the husband for his divorced wife if he can return to her. If she is not permitted for him anymore, until she marries another husband, then he does not have to provide her with spending and housing.)&#8221; An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً &#8211; وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2. Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you. And establish the testimony for Allah. That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) (3. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ordaining Kindness towards Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted says that when the woman who is in her `Iddah nears the end of the `Iddah term, the husband must decide to reconcile with her, thus keeping their marriage together,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in a good manner) while being kind to her in their companionship. Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, &#8220;His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.&#8221; Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata&#8217; commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) &#8220;It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.&#8217; This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah&#8217;s punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Taqwa of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &#8220;The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإْحْسَانِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90). The greatest Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that contains relief is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)&#8221; `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, &#8220;Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak.`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from where he never could imagine.) from resources he did not anticipate&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He will provide him from where he never could imagine) from where he never thought of or anticipated.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he rode the Prophet&#8217;s camel while sitting behind the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ، وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O boy! I will teach you words [so learn them]. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah. Know that if the Ummah gather their strength to bring you benefit, they will never bring you benefit, except that which Allah has decreed for you. Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. The pens have been raised and the pages are dry.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said: &#8220;Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.) meaning, Allah will execute His decisions and judgement that He made for him, in whatever way He wills and chooses,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) This is like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.) (13:8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً &#8211; ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4. Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) (5. That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. [see 2:228] The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and for those who have no courses&#8230;) as for His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you have doubt&#8230;) There are two opinions: First, is the saying of a group of the Salaf, like Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd. That is, if they see blood and there is doubt if it was menstrual blood or not. The second, is that if you do not know the ruling in this case, then know that their `Iddah is three months. This has been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr and it is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. And this is the more obvious meaning. Supporting this view is what is reported from Ubay bin Ka`b that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an, the young, the old and the pregnant.&#8221; Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. There are the young, the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.&#8217; Later on, this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>`Iddah of Pregnant Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden;) Allah says: the pregnant woman&#8217;s `Iddah ends when she gives birth, whether in the case of divorce or death of the husband, according to the agreement of the majority of scholars of the Salaf and later generations. This is based upon this honorable Ayah and what is mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Salamah said, &#8220;A man came to Ibn `Abbas while Abu Hurayrah was sitting with him and said, `Give me your verdict regarding a lady who delivered a baby forty days after the death of her husband.&#8217; Ibn `Abbas said,` [Her `Iddah period lasts until] the end of the longest among the two prescribed periods.&#8217; I recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens;) Abu Hurayrah said, `I agree with my cousin (Abu Salamah).&#8217; Then Ibn `Abbas sent his slave Kurayb to Umm Salamah to ask her. She replied, `The husband of Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then she received a marriage proposal and Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her to somebody. Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed to her.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this short form of the Hadith, which Muslim and other scholars of Hadith collected using its longer form. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miswar bin Makhramah said, &#8220;Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth to a child a few days after the death of her husband. When she finished the postdelivery term, she was proposed to. So she sought the permission of Allah&#8217;s Messenger for the marriage, and he permitted her to marry, so she got married.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this narration, as did Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah with a different chain of narration from the Hadith of Subay`ah. Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah said that his father wrote to `Umar bin `Abdullah bin Al-Arqam Az-Zuhri, requesting that he go to Subay`ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah to ask her about the matter in question, and about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to her when she sought his verdict. `Umar bin `Abdullah wrote to `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah informing him that Subay`ah told him that she had been married to Sa`d bin Khawlah, and he was one of those who participated in the battle of Badr. He died during the Farewell Pilgrimage, while she was pregnant. Soon after his death, she gave birth. When she passed the postnatal term, she beautified herself for those who might propose to her. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba`kak came to her and said, `Why do I see you have beautified yourself Do you wish to remarry By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days have passed.&#8221; Subay`ah said, &#8220;When he said that, I dressed myself in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and asked him about his verdict. He gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry after I had given birth to my child, saying I could marry if I wish.&#8221; This is the narration that Muslim collected. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in a shorter form. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) means, Allah will make his matters lenient for him and will soon bring forth relief and a quick way out,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you;) meaning, this is His commandment and legislation that He sent down to you through His Messenger ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.) means, Allah will prevent what he fears and multiply his reward even for the little good he does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى &#8211; لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6. Lodge them where you dwell, according to what you have, and do not harm them so as to suppress them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden. Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) (7. Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her `Iddah period,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to &#8220;Your ability.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house.&#8221; Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them) &#8220;He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant&#8217;s well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment,) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child.) (2:233) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let the rich man spend according to his means;) means, the wealthy father or his representative should spend on the child according to his means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.) This is as Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah does not burden a person beyond what He can bear.) [2:286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Story of a Woman who had Taqwa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً &#8211; إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6] There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221; Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَوْ أَخَذَتْ مَا فِي رَحْيَيْهَا وَلَمْ تَنْفُضْهَا (لَطَحَنَتْهَا) إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً &#8211; فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً &#8211; أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً &#8211; رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8. And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers; and We called it to a severe account, and We shall punish it with a horrible torment.) (9. So it tasted the evil result of its affair, and the consequence of its affair was loss.) (10. Allah has prepared for them a severe torment. So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding, those who believe! Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) (11. A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations, that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light.

Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Punishment for defying Allah&#8217;s Commandments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted threatens those who defy His commands, deny His Messengers and contradict His legislation, by informing them of the end that earlier nations met who did the same,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;) meaning, they rebelled, rejected and arrogantly refused to obey Allah and they would not follow His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So it tasted the evil result of its affair,) meaning, they tasted the evil consequences of defiance and they regretted their actions when regret does not avail,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراًأَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the consequence of its affair was loss. And Allah has prepared for them a severe torment.) means, in the Hereafter, added to the torment that was sent down on them in this life. Allah the Exalted said, after mentioning what happened to the disbelieving nations,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding,) meaning, `O you who have sound understanding, do not be like them because if you do, you will suffer what they suffered, O people of comprehension,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(who believe) meaning, in Allah and His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) meaning, this Qur&#8217;an. Allah also said,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) Some said that the Messenger is the subject of what is being sent [as a reminder] because the Messenger is the one that conveys the Dhikr. Ibn Jarir said that what is correct is that the Messenger explains the Dhikr. This is why Allah the Exalted said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) meaning, plain and apparent. The statement of Allah;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Guardian of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.) (2:257) meaning, out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. Allah the Exalted called the revelation that He has sent down, light, on account of the guidance that it brings. Allah also called it Ruh, in that, it brings life to the hearts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And thus We have sent to you Ruh of our command. You knew not what is the book, nor what is faith But We have made it a light wherewith we guide whosoever of Our servants We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding to the straight path.)

<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.) was explained several times before, and therefore, we do not need to repeat its explanation here. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and of the earth the like thereof.) means, He created seven earths. In the Two Sahihs, there is a Hadith that states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«مَنْ ظَلَمَ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, even if it was a mere hand span, then his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths.) And in Sahih Al-Bukhari the wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«خُسِفَ بِهِ إِلَى سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;he will sink down to the seven earths.) In the beginning of my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I mentioned the various narrations for this Hadith when I narrated the story of the creation of the earth. All the thanks and praise is due to Allah. Those who explained this Hadith to mean the seven continents have brought an implausible explanation that contradicts the letter of the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith without having proof. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Talaq, all the thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked which books he advises a student of knowledge to read in the areas of ‘Aqeedah, Tafseer, Hadeeth and its science, and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He specifically stated that a student should memorize and understand (in the topic of <b><i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i></b>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Usool ath-Thalaathah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>Shuroot us-Salaah wa Arkaanihaa wa Wajibaatihaa</b>,<br />
(3) <b>al-Qawaa’id ul-&#8216;Arba’ah</b>,<br />
(4) <b>Shuroot Laa Ilaaha illAllaah</b>,<br />
(5) <b>Nawaaqid ul-Islaam</b>, and<br />
(6) <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b>, all by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for (7) <b>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</b>, then he said that if a person memorizes it, then that is good, but he did not stress it as with the above works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, he did not stress memorizing (8) <b>al-Waasitiyyah</b>, but instead said that a student can either memorize it or learn it and understand it well.<br />
He also mentioned that a person should study (9) the various treatises contained in <b>Majmoo’ Fataawaa Shaykh ul-Islaam Bin Taymiyyah</b> (presumably <b>al-Fatwa al-Hamawiyyah al-Kubraa, ar-Risaalat ut-Tadmuriyyah, al-&#8216;Eemaan</b>, etc., although he did not name names), and (10) <b>Sharh ut-Tahaawiyyah</b> by Ibn Abee al-‘Izz al-Hanafee (d. 792) if he wants to expand his scope regarding the subject of Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other subjects, I do not recall him specifically saying that a student should memorize anything except for the one who desires to learn about the differences between the four madhaahib in <b><i>Fiqh</i></b>. He said that it is befitting for such a person to memorize a matan (lower level Fiqh manual) for each of the four madhaahib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the area of <b><i>hadeeth</i></b>, he mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Arba’een an-Nawawiyyah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b>, and<br />
(3) <b>Buloogh ul-Maraam</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although he did not specifically say that one should memorize them, I have heard other Scholars (such as Shaykh Saalih ibn ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh) say that one should begin his course in hadeeth with the memorization and study of <b>al-Arba’een</b>. The more famous explanations for it are that of an-Nawawee (d. 676) himself, which is a very brief explanation for beginners, that of Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed (d. 702), which is perhaps a middle-level explanation, and that of Ibn Rajab (d. 795), which is more advanced and thorough than the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have also recommended that the more advanced and dedicated students should memorize and learn the other two: <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b> and <b>Buloogh al-Maraam</b> by ‘Abdul-Ghanee al-Maqdisee (d. 600) and Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalaanee (d. 852) respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <b><i>tafseer</i></b>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said that a person should start with the tafseer of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa’dee (d. 1376), titled <b>Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaam il-Manaan</b>, because its author is a well-known Salafee (and hence does not fall into the same ta’weel and mistakes of the other lower-level tafaaseer, such as al-Jalaalayn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said that if a person can find a Salafee teacher to guide him, he should study <b>Fath ul-Qadeer</b> of Shawkaanee (d. 1250) – this is because the teacher will help him:<br />
(a) Be alert to some of the mistakes of Shawkaanee regarding as-Sifaat, and<br />
(b) Help him with the more difficult aspects of the &#8216;Arabic language that occur in the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, he mentioned <b>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</b>, stating that it is okay if a student studies from one of the various abridgements available nowadays (like that of ar-Rifaa’ee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taken From 22 Question About the Salafee Da&#8217;wah.</b><br />
<strong>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan ibn &#8216;Alee al-Jaamee</strong><br />

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Declaration of Innocence from Shirk </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">This Surah is the Surah of disavowal from the deeds of the idolators. It commands a complete disavowal of that. Allah&#8217;s statement, (Say: &#8220;O disbelievers!&#8221;) includes every disbeliever on the face of the earth, however, this statement is particularly directed towards the disbelievers of the Quraysh. It has been said that in their ignorance they invited the Messenger of Allah to worship their idols for a year and they would (in turn) worship his God for a year. Therefore, Allah revealed this Surah.</span></p>

<p>[<strong>Taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong>] <span style="font-size:small;">&#8211;</span></p>
<p>A Summary of the Story of the People of the Elephant</p>
<p>This is the story of the people of the Elephant, in brief, and summarized. It has already been mentioned in the story of the People of the Ditch that Dhu Nuas, the last king of Himyar, a polytheist &#8212; was the one who ordered killing the People of the Ditch. They were Christians and their number was approximately twenty thousand. None of them except a man named Daws Dhu Tha`laban escaped. He fled to Ash-Sham where he sought protection from Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham, who was also a Christian. Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the king of Ethiopia (Abyssinia), who was closer to the home of the man. An-Najashi sent two governors with him: Aryat and Abrahah bin As-Sabah Abu Yaksum, along with a great army. The army entered Yemen and began searching the houses and looting in search of the king of Himyar (Dhu Nuwas). Dhu Nuwas was eventually killed by drowning in the sea. Thus, the Ethiopians were free to rule Yemen, with Aryat and Abrahah as its governors. However, they continually disagreed about matters, attacked each other, fought each other and warred against each other, until one of them said to the other, &#8220;There is no need for our two armies to fight. Instead let us fight each other (in a duel) and the one who kills the other will be the ruler of Yemen.&#8221; So the other accepted the challenge and they held a duel. Behind each man was a channel of water (to keep either from fleeing). Aryat gained the upper hand and struck Abrahah with his sword, splitting his nose and mouth, and slashing his face. But `Atawdah, Abrahah&#8217;s guard, attacked Aryat and killed him. Thus, Abrahah returned wounded to Yemen where he was treated for his injuries and recovered. He thus became the commander of the Abyssinian army in Yemen.</p>
<p>Then the king of Abyssinia, An-Najashi wrote to him, blaming him for what had happened (between him and Aryat) and threatened him, saying that he swore to tread on the soil of Yemen and cut off his forelock. Therefore, Abrahah sent a messenger with gifts and precious objects to An-Najashi to appease him and flatter him, and a sack containing soil from Yemen and a piece of hair cut from his forelock. He said in his letter to the king, &#8220;Let the king walk upon this soil and thus fulfill his oath, and this is my forelock hair that I send to you.&#8221; When An-Najashi received this, he was pleased with Abrahah and gave him his approval. Then Abrahah wrote to An-Najashi saying that he would build a church for him in Yemen the like of which had never been built before. Thus, he began to build a huge church in San`a&#8217;, tall and beautifully crafted and decorated on all sides. The Arabs called it Al-Qullays because of its great height, and because if one looked at it, his cap would be in danger of falling off as he tilted his head back. Then Abrahah Al-Ashram decided to force the Arabs to make their pilgrimage to this magnificent church, just as they had performed pilgrimage to the Ka`bah in Makkah. He announced this in his kingdom (Yemen), but it was rejected by the Arab tribes of `Adnan and Qahtan. The Quraysh were infuriated by it, so much so that one of them journeyed to the church and entered it one night. He then relieved himself in the church and ran away (escaping the people). When its custodians saw what he had done, they reported it to their king, Abrahah, saying; &#8220;One of the Quraysh has done this in anger over their House in whose place you have appointed this church.&#8221; Upon hearing this, Abrahah swore to march to the House of Makkah (the Ka`bah) and destroy it stone by stone. Muqatil bin Sulayman mentioned that a group of young men from the Quraysh entered the church and started a fire in it on an extremely windy day. So the church caught on fire and collapsed to the ground. Due to this Abrahah prepared himself and set out with a huge and powerful army so that none might prevent him from carrying out his mission. He took along a great, powerful elephant that had a huge body the like of which had never been seen before. This elephant was called Mahmud and it was sent to Abrahah from An-Najashi, the king of Abyssinia, particularly for this expedition. It has also been said that he had eight other elephants with him; their number was also reported to be twelve, plus the large one, Mahmud &#8212; and Allah knows best. Their intention was to use this big elephant to demolish the Ka`bah. They planned to do this by fastening chains to the pillars of the Ka`bah and placing the other ends around the neck of the elephant. Then they would make the elephant pull on them in order to tear down the walls of the Ka`bah all at one time. When the Arabs heard of Abrahah&#8217;s expedition, they considered it an extremely grave matter. They held it to be an obligation upon them to defend the Sacred House and repel whoever intended a plot against it. Thus, the noblest man of the people of Yemen and the greatest of their chiefs set out to face him (Abrahah). His name was Dhu Nafr. He called his people, and whoever would respond to his call among the Arabs, to go to war against Abrahah and fight in defense of the Sacred House. He called the people to stop Abrahah&#8217;s plan to demolish and tear down the Ka`bah. So the people responded to him and they entered into battle with Abrahah, but he defeated them. This was due to Allah&#8217;s will and His intent to honor and venerate the Ka`bah.</p>
<p>The army continued on its way until it came to the land of Khath`am where it was confronted by Nufayl bin Habib Al-Kath`ami along with his people, the Shahran and Nahis tribes. They fought Abrahah but he defeated them and captured Nufayl bin Habib. Initially he wanted to kill him, but he forgave him and took him as his guide to show him the way to Al-Hijaz.</p>
<p>When they approached the area of At-Ta&#8217;if, its people &#8212; the people of Thaqif &#8212; went out to Abrahah. They wanted to appease him because they were fearful for their place of worship, which they called Al-Lat. Abrahah was kind to them and they sent a man named Abu Righal with him as a guide. When they reached a place known as Al-Mughammas, which is near Makkah, they settled there. Then he sent his troops on a foray to capture the camels and other grazing animals of the Makkans, which they did, including about two hundred camels belonging to `Abdul-Muttalib. The leader of this particular expedition was a man named Al-Aswad bin Mafsud. According to what Ibn Ishaq mentioned, some of the Arabs used to satirize him (because of the part he played in this historical in this historical incident). Then Abrahah sent an emissary named Hanatah Al-Himyari to enter Makkah, commanding him to bring the head of the Quraysh to him. He also commanded him to inform him that the king will not fight the people of Makkah unless they try to prevent him from the destruction of the Ka`bah. Hanatah went to the city and he was directed to `Abdul-Muttalib bin Hashim, to whom he relayed Abrahah&#8217;s message. `Abdul-Muttalib replied, &#8220;By Allah! We have no wish to fight him, nor are we in any position to do so. This is the Sacred House of Allah, and the house of His Khalil, Ibrahim, and if He wishes to prevent him (Abrahah) from (destroying) it, it is His House and His Sacred Place (to do so). And if He lets him approach it, by Allah, We have no means to defend it from him.&#8221; So Hanatah told him, &#8220;Come with me to him (Abrahah).&#8221; And so `Abdul-Muttalib went with him. When Abrahah saw him, he was impressed by him, because `Abdul-Muttalib was a large and handsome man. So Abrahah descended from his seat and sat with him on a carpet on the ground. Then he asked his translator to say to him, &#8220;What do you need&#8221; `Abdul-Muttalib replied to the translator, &#8220;I want the king to return my camels which he has taken from me which are two hundred in number.&#8221; Abrahah then told his translator to tell him, &#8220;I was impressed by you when I first saw you, but now I withdraw from you after you have spoken to me. You are asking me about two hundred camels which I have taken from you and you leave the matter of a house which is (the foundation of) religion and the religion of your fathers, which I have come to destroy and you do not speak to me about it&#8221; `Abdul-Muttalib said to him, &#8220;Verily, I am the lord of the camels. As for the House, it has its Lord Who will defend it.&#8221; Abrahah said, &#8220;I cannot be prevented (from destroying it).&#8221; `Abdul-Muttalib answered, &#8220;Then do so.&#8221; It is said that a number of the chiefs of the Arabs accompanied `Abdul-Muttalib and offered Abrahah a third of the wealth of the tribe of Tihamah if he would withdraw from the House, but he refused and returned `Abdul-Muttalib&#8217;s camels to him. `Abdul-Muttalib then returned to his people and ordered them to leave Makkah and seek shelter at the top of the mountains, fearful of the excesses which might be committed by the army against them. Then he took hold of the metal ring of the door of the Ka`bah, and along with a number of Quraysh, he called upon Allah to give them victory over Abrahah and his army. `Abdul-Muttalib said, while hanging on to the ring of the Ka`bah&#8217;s door, &#8220;There is no matter more important to any man right now than the defense of his livestock and property. So, O my Lord! Defend Your property. Their cross and their cunning will not be victorious over your cunning by the time morning comes.&#8221; According to Ibn Ishaq, then `Abdul-Muttalib let go of the metal ring of the door of the Ka`bah, and they left Makkah and ascended to the mountains tops. Muqatil bin Sulayman mentioned that they left one hundred animals (camels) tied near the Ka`bah hoping that some of the army would take some of them without a right to do so, and thus bring about the vengeance of Allah upon themselves.</p>
<p>When morning came, Abrahah prepared to enter the sacred city of Makkah. He prepared the elephant named Mahmud. He mobilized his army, and they turned the elephant towards the Ka`bah. At that moment Nufayl bin Habib approached it and stood next to it, and taking it by its ear, he said, &#8220;Kneel, Mahmud! Then turn around and return directly to whence you came. For verily, you are in the Sacred City of Allah.&#8221; Then he released the elephant&#8217;s ear and it knelt, after which Nufayl bin Habib left and hastened to the mountains. Abrahah&#8217;s men beat the elephant in an attempt to make it rise, but it refused. They beat it on its head with axes and used hooked staffs to pull it out of its resistance and make it stand, but it refused. So they turned him towards Yemen, and he rose and walked quickly. Then they turned him towards Ash-Sham and he did likewise. Then they turned him towards the east and he did the same thing. Then they turned him towards Makkah and he knelt down again. Then Allah sent against them the birds from the sea, like swallows and herons. Each bird carried three stones the size of chickpeas and lentils, one in each claw and one in its beak. Everyone who was hit by them was destroyed, though not all of them were hit. They fled in panic along the road asking about the whereabouts of Nufayl that he might point out to them the way home. Nufayl, however, was at the top of the mountain with the Quraysh and the Arabs of the Hijaz observing the wrath which Allah had caused to descend on the people of the elephant. Nufayl then began to say, &#8220;Where will they flee when the One True God is the Pursuer For Al-Ashram is defeated and not the victor. Ibn Ishaq reported that Nufayl said these lines of poetry at that time,</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you live with continued support We favored you all with a revolving eye in the morning (i.e., a guide along the way). If you saw, but you did not see it at the side of the rock covered mountain that which we saw. Then you will excuse me and praise my affair, and do not grieve over what is lost between us. I praised Allah when I saw the birds, and I feared that the stones might be thrown down upon us. So all the people are asking about the whereabouts of Nufayl, as if I have some debt that I owe the Abyssinians.&#8221; `Ata&#8217; bin Yasar and others have said that all of them were not struck by the torment at this hour of retribution. Rather some of them were destroyed immediately, while others were gradually broken down limb by limb while trying to escape. Abrahah was of those who was broken down limb by limb until he eventually died in the land of Khath`am. Ibn Ishaq said that they left (Makkah) being struck down and destroyed along every path and at every water spring. Abrahah&#8217;s body was afflicted by the pestilence of the stones and his army carried him away with them as he was falling apart piece by piece, until they arrived back in San`a&#8217;. When they arrived there he was but like the baby chick of a bird. And he did not die until his heart fell out of his chest. So they claim. Ibn Ishaq said that when Allah sent Muhammad with the prophethood, among the things that he used to recount to the Quraysh as blessings that Allah had favored them with of His bounties, was His defending them from the attack of the Abyssinians. Due to this they (the Quraysh) were allowed to remain (safely in Makkah) for a period of time. Thus, Allah said,</p>
<p>(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant Did He not make their plot go astray And He sent against them birds, in flocks (Ababil). Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like `Asf, Ma&#8217;kul.)</p>
<p>(For the Ilaf of the Quraysh, their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer. So, let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.) (106:1-4) meaning, that Allah would not alter their situation because Allah wanted good for them if they accepted Him. Ibn Hisham said, &#8220;Al-Ababil are the groups, as the Arabs do not speak of just one (bird).&#8221; He also said, &#8220;As for As-Sijjil, Yunus An-Nahwi and Abu `Ubaydah have informed me that according to the Arabs, it means something hard and solid.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Some of the commentators have mentioned that it is actually two Persian words that the Arabs have made into one word. The two words are Sanj and Jil, Sanj meaning stones, and Jil meaning clay. The rocks are of these two types: stone and clay.&#8221; He continued saying, &#8220;Al-`Asf are the leaves of the crops that are not gathered. One of them is called `Asfah.&#8221; This is the end of what he mentioned. Hammad bin Salamah narrated from `Asim, who related from Zirr, who related from `Abdullah and Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that they said,</p>
<p>(birds Ababil.) &#8220;In groups.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak both said, &#8220;Ababil means some of them following after others.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Qatadah both said, &#8220;Ababil means many.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;Ababil means in various, successive groups.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;Ababil means different, coming from here and there. They came upon them from everywhere.&#8221; Al-Kasa&#8217;i said, &#8220;I heard some of the grammarians saying, &#8220;The singular of Ababil is Ibil.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded from Ishaq bin `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p>(And He sent against them birds, Ababil.) &#8220;This means in divisions just as camels march in divisions (in their herds).&#8221; It is reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p>(And He sent against them birds, Ababil.) &#8220;They had snouts like the beaks of birds and paws like the paws of dogs.&#8221; It has been reported that `Ikrimah said commenting on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p>(birds, Ababil.) &#8220;They were green birds that came out of the sea and they had heads like the heads of predatory animals.&#8221; It has been reported from `Ubayd bin `Umayr that he commented:</p>
<p>(birds, Ababil.) &#8220;They were black birds of the sea that had stones in their beaks and claws.&#8221; And the chains of narration (for these statements) are all authentic. It is reported from `Ubayd bin `Umayr that he said, &#8220;When Allah wanted to destroy the People of the Elephant, he sent birds upon them that came from sea swallows. Each of the birds was carrying three small stones &#8212; two stones with its feet and one stone in its beak. They came until they gathered in rows over their heads. Then they gave a loud cry and threw what was in their claws and beaks. Thus, no stone fell upon the head of any man except that it came out of his behind (i.e., it went through him), and it did not fall on any part of his body except that it came out from the opposite side. Then Allah sent a severe wind that struck the stones and increased them in force. Thus, they were all destroyed.&#8221;</p>
