Chapter 15<br>
The Righteous conduct on Regular base</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah &#8211; Islamic Monotheism) to be affected by Allah&#8217;s Reminder (this Qur&#8217;an), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before (i.e., Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened?&#8221;</b></span><b> (57:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And We sent `Isa (Jesus) &#8211; son of Maryam (Mary), and gave him the Injeel (Gospel). And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy. But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.&#8221;</b></span><b> (57:27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (16:92)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And worship your Rubb until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death).&#8221;</b></span><b> (15:99)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are Ahadith, one of them is narrated by `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">:</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) liked that act of worship most in the performance of which a person was regular and constant.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>153.</b> `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Should anyone fall asleep at night and fail to recite his portion of the Qur&#8217;an, or a part of it, if he recites it between the Fajr prayer and the Zuhr prayer, it will be recorded for him as though he had recited it during the night&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>154.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Abdullah! Do not be like so-and-so. He used to get up at night for optional prayer but abandoned it later.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>155.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) missed the optional night Salat (Tahajjud) due to pain or any other reason, he would perform twelve Rak`ah during the day time.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to    (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi&#8217; demonstrated    before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows    and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her.    She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother    (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his    mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your    mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my    prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk    to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don&#8217;t bring death to him unless he has seen    the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he    would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple    (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that    village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became    pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He    is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and    spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they    were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said:    Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and    said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and    when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we    have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before.    He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Book 032, Number 6188: </font></p>
<p>        </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the    second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined    himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He    said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued    with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and    she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in    prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she    again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother    (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she    said: My Lord, don&#8217;t give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The    story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani    Isra&#8217;il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people):    If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to    her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and    he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth    to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and    demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You    have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from    your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just    leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he    came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He    is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking    blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just    rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was    sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His    mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to    see towards him, and said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him. He then returned to the chest    and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am    seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his    sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further    reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him    a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have    committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector,    and his mother said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,    and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between    them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said:    O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him, and they    passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you    committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her, and you said: O Allah,    make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t    make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in    fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she    had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.</font></p>

Abdullah reported that two young men, one from the    Muhajirin (emigrants) and the other one from the Angr (helpers) fell into dispute and the    Muhajir called his fellow Muhajirin, and the Ansari (the helper) called the Ansar (for    help). In the meanwhile, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came there and said:    What is this, the proclamation of the days of jahiliya (ignorance)? They said: Allah&#8217;s    Messenger, there is nothing serious. The two young men fell into dispute and the one    struck at the back of the other. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Well, a person    should help his brother whether he is an oppressor or an oppressed. If he is the oppressor    he should prevent him from doing it, for that is his help; and if he is the oppressed he    should be helped (against oppression).</font></p>

The Ansiri said: O Ansar! And the    Muhijir said: O Emigrants! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What    are these proclamations of the Days of Ignorance? They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, a person    from the emigrants struck at the back of an Ansari, whereupon he said: It is something    disgusting. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy heard it and said: They have indeed done it. By Allah, when    we would return to Medina the respectable amongst them (the Ansar) would turn away the    mean (the emigrants). Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Permit me so that I should strike the neck of    this hypocrite.

And the term with my Lord is that I said to Him: 1 am a human being and I am    pleased just as a human being is pleased and I lose temper just as a human being loses    temper, so for any person from amongst my Ummah whom I curse and he in no way deserves it,    let that, O Lord, be made a source of purification and purity and nearness to (Allah) on    the Day of Resurrection.</font></p>

I went to him and paid him    salutation thrice at (his) door but he made no response to me and so I came back Thereupon    he (&#8216;Umar) said: What stood in your way that you did not turn up? I said: I did come to    you and paid you salutations at your door three times but I was not given any response, so    I came back as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has said: When any one of    you seeks permission three times and he i. e not granted permission, he should come back.    Umar said: Bring a witness to support that you say, otherwise I shall take you to task.    Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b said: None should stand with him (as a witness) but the youngest amongst the    people. Abu Sa&#8217;id said: I am the youngest amongst the people, whereupon he said: Then you    go with him (to support his contention).</font></p>

He stood (before us) and    said: I ask you to bear witness in the name of Allah whether anyone amongst you heard    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Permission (for entering the house)    should be sought three times and if permission is granted to you (then get in). otherwise    go back. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b said: What is the iiiatter? He said: I sought permission yesterday    from &#8216;Umar b. Khattab three times but he did not permit me, so I came back; then I went to    him today and visited him and informed him that I had come to him yesterday and greeted    him thrice, then came back, whereupon he said: Yes, we did hear you but be were at that    time busy, but why did you not seek permission (further and you must have never gone back    until you were permitted to do so). He said: I sought permission (in the manner) that I    heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said (in connection &#8216;With the    seeking of permission for entering the house of a stranger). Thereupon he (Hadrat Umar)    said: By Allah, I shall torture your back and your stomach unless you bring one who may    bear witness to what you state. &#8216;Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b said: By Allah, none should stand with you    (to bear testimony) but the youngest amongst us. And he therefore, said to Abu Sa&#8217;id:    Stand up. So I stood up until I came to Umar and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) say this.</font></p>

They (the Companions present there) said: None    but the youngest amongst us would bear out this fact. So Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri (who was the    youngest one in that company) said: We have been commanded to do so (while visiting the    house of other people).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam in his complete  shape and form (directly), sixty cubits (about 30 meters) in height. When He created him,  He said (to him), &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what  they will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your  offspring.&#8221; Adam (went and) said, &#8216;As-Salamu alaikum (Peace be upon you).&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;AsSalamu-&#8216;Alaika wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you) So they  increased &#8216;Wa Rahmatullah&#8217; The Prophet added &#8216;So whoever will enter Paradise, will be of  the shape and form of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam&#8217;s (offspring) (i.e. stature of  human beings is being diminished continuously) to the present time.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Fadl bin &#8216;Abbas rode behind the Prophet as his companion  rider on the back portion of his she camel on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifice,  10th Dhul-Hijja) and Al-Fadl was a handsome man. The Prophet stopped to give the people  verdicts. In the meantime, a beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came, asking the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty attracted him.  The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at her; so the Prophet held out his  hand backwards and caught the chin of Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in  order that he should not gaze at her. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of  Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due (compulsory) on my  father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be  sufficient that I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;Beware! Avoid sitting on the  roads.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! We can&#8217;t help sitting (on  the roads) as these are (our places) here we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216; l f you  refuse but to sit, then pay the road its right &#8216; They said, &#8220;What is the right of the  road, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8216;Lowering your gaze, refraining from harming  others, returning greeting, and enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is evil.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say: As-Salam be  on Allah from His worshipers, As-Salam be on Gabriel, As-Salam be on Michael, As-Salam be  on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Allah  Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one sits in the prayer, one should say,  &#8216;At-Tahiyatu-lillahi Was-Salawatu, Wat-Taiyibatu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyyu wa  Rah-matul-lahi wa Barakatuhu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaina wa &#8216;ala &#8216;Ibadillahi assalihin, for if he  says so, then it will be for all the pious slave of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth.  (Then he should say), &#8216;Ash-hadu an la ilaha illalllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;Abduhu  wa rasulu-hu,&#8217; and then he can choose whatever speech (i.e. invocation) he wishes &#8221;  (See Hadith No. 797, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he was a boy of ten at the time when the Prophet  emigrated to Medina. He added: I served Allah&#8217;s Apostle for ten years (the last part of  his life time) and I know more than the people about the occasion whereupon the order of  Al-Hijab was revealed (to the Prophet). Ubai b n Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. It was  revealed (for the first time) during the marriage of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with Zainab bint  Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who  took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they  prolonged their stay. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with  him till he came to the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle thought that  those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he  entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The  Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he  returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone. At that time the Divine  Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed, and the Prophet set a screen between me and him (his  family). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 74, Number 256: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet married Zainab, the people came and were  offered a meal, and then they sat down (after finishing their meals) and started chatting.  The Prophet showed as if he wanted to get up, but they did not get up. When he noticed  that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and went away, while some others kept  on sitting. When the Prophet returned to enter, he found the people still sitting, but  then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet of their departure and he came and went  in. I intended to go in but the Prophet put a screen between me and him, for Allah  revealed:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses..&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Let your wives be veiled&#8221; But he did not do so. The wives of  the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.&#8217; Once  Sauda, the daughter of Zam&#8217;a went out and she was a tall woman. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw  her while he was in a gathering, and said, &#8220;I have recognized you, O Sauda!&#8221; He  (&#8216;Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling  of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover  excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man peeped through a round hole into the dwelling place  of the Prophet, while the Prophet had a Midray (an iron comb) with which he was scratching  his head. the Prophet said, &#8221; Had known you were looking (through the hole), I would  have pierced your eye with it (i.e., the comb).&#8221; Verily! The order of taking  permission to enter has been enjoined because of that sight, (that one should not look  unlawfully at the state of others). (See Hadith No. 807, Vol. 7) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have not seen a thing resembling &#8216;lamam&#8217; (minor sins)  than what Abu Huraira &#8216;narrated from the Prophet who said &#8220;Allah has written for  Adam&#8217;s son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is  the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing), the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the  inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was present in one of the gatherings of the Ansar,  Abu Musa came as if he was scared, and said, &#8220;I asked permission to enter upon &#8216;Umar  three times, but I was not given the permission, so I returned.&#8221; (When &#8216;Umar came to  know about it) he said to Abu Musa, &#8220;Why did you not enter?&#8217;. Abu Musa replied,  &#8220;I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the  permission is not given, then he should return.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah! We  will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it.&#8221; (Abu Musa went to a gathering of the  Ansar and said). &#8220;Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet ?&#8221; Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  said, &#8220;By Allah, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a  witness).&#8221; (Abu Said) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed  &#8216;Umar that the Prophet had said so.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sahl said, &#8220;We used to feel happy on Fridays.&#8221; I  asked Sahl, &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said, &#8220;There was an old woman of our acquaintance who  used to send somebody to Buda&#8217;a (Ibn Maslama said, &#8220;Buda&#8217;a was a garden of date-palms  at Medina). She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots and put it  in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the  Jumua (Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present  us with that meal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a  midday nap, nor meals, except after the Friday prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 60, Vol.2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa-bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said, &#8220;The Prophet rode over a donkey  with a saddle underneath which there was a thick soft Fadakiya velvet sheet. Usama bin  Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (who was  sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened  before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims  and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, and  there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that  gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Don&#8217;t cover us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,  dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the  Holy Quran. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai&#8217; bin Salul said, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than  what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go  back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to  him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;(O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!) Come to us and  bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims,  the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with  one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then  rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada, he said, &#8220;O  Sa&#8217;d, didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai). He said  so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him,  for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided  to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with  the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the  way you saw him behaving.&#8221; So the Prophet excused him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik narrating (when he did not join the  battle of Tabuk): Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to speak to us. I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips to  return to my greetings or not till fifty nights passed away. The Prophet then announced  (to the people) Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for us (acceptance of our repentance) at the time when  he had offered the Fajr (morning) prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu  Marthad Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, &#8220;Proceed till you reach  Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin  Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca).&#8221; So we overtook her while she was proceeding on  her camel at the same place as Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us. We said (to her) &#8220;Where is  the letter which is with you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; So we  made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8220;We do not see any letter.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not tell a lie. By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out  the letter, I will strip you of your clothes&#8217; When she noticed that I was serious, she put  her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and  brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the letter. The Prophet  said (to Habib), &#8220;What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied,  &#8220;I have done nothing except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not  changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of  Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my property, as there is none among  your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against  harm). The Prophet said, &#8220;Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him  (anything) but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Verily he has betrayed Allah,  His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah looked upon the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do  whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar  wept and said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e.,  under the command of another ruler). By Allah, I think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from  his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of &#8216;Abdul  Muttalib. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If  the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will  request him to recommend us to him. &#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah! If we ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us.  Besides, I will never ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; (See Hadith No 728, Vol 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was walking with the Prophet at the Hurra of Medina  in the evening, the mountain of Uhud appeared before us. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu  Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it,  not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except  that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole  amount) among Allah&#8217;s slaves like this and like this and like this.&#8221; The Prophet  pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, &#8220;O Abu Dhar!&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Labbaik wa Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Those who have  much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who  do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).&#8221; Then he ordered me,  &#8220;Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.&#8221; He  went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something  might have happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I  remembered the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept  on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but  then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, &#8220;That was  Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without  joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft &#8216; </font></p>

Then the Prophet came back and found those people  still sitting. Later on those people got up and went away. So I went to the Prophet and  informed him that they had left. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came, and entered (his house). I wanted to  enter(along with him) but he dropped a curtain between me and him. Allah then revealed: &#8216;O  you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet&#8217;s Houses until leave is given&#8230; (to His  statement)&#8230; Verily! That shall be an enormity, in Allah&#8217;s sight.&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

That person came, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He (Ali) is sleeping in the mosque.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went there and found him lying. His upper body cover had fallen off to one side of  his body, and so he was covered with dust. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started cleaning the dust from  him, saying, &#8220;Get up, O Abu Turab! Get up, Abu Turab!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 432, Vol  1) </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Good Manners and Form (Al-Adab)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.073.001"></a>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Walid bin &#8216;Aizar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Abi Amr &#8216;Ash-Shaibani saying, &#8220;The owner of this house.&#8221; he pointed to &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s house, &#8220;said, &#8216;I asked the Prophet &#8216;Which deed is loved most by Allah?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;To offer prayers at their early (very first) stated times.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To be good and dutiful to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, To participate in Jihad for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The Prophet narrated to me these three things, and if I had asked more, he would have told me more.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked for the fourth time, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet, &#8220;Shall I participate in Jihad?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are your parents living?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; the Prophet said, &#8220;Do Jihad for their benefit.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.&#8221; It was asked (by the people), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How does a man curse his parents?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;The man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While three persons were traveling, they were overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain. A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it. They said to each other. &#8216;Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from your difficulty. one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked (the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn&#8217;t return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky.&#8217; So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the second person said, &#8216;O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with her), she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said &#8216;O Allah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s slave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.&#8217; I said (to him). &#8216;Go and take those cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.&#8217; And so Allah released them (from their difficulty).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden you ( 1 ) to be undutiful to your mothers (2) to withhold (what you should give) or (3) demand (what you do not deserve), and (4) to bury your daughters alive. And Allah has disliked that (A) you talk too much about others ( B), ask too many questions (in religion), or (C) waste your property.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said thrice, &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the great sins?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221; He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah: to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet sat up after he had been reclining and added, &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false witness; I warn you against giving a forged statement and a false witness.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying that warning till we thought that he would not stop.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the greatest sins or he was asked about the greatest sins. He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to kill a soul which Allah has forbidden to kill; and to be undutiful or unkind to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Shall I inform you of the biggest of the great sins? That is the forged statement or the false witness.&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba (the sub-narrator) states that most probably the Prophet said, &#8220;the false witness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother came to me, hoping (for my favor) during the lifetime of the Prophet asked the Prophet, &#8220;May I treat her kindly?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Uyaina said, &#8220;Then Allah revealed: &#8216;Allah forbids you not with regards to those who fought not against you because of religion, and drove you not out from your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them.&#8217;&#8230;&#8230;.(60.8)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sufyan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Heraclius sent for him and said, &#8220;What did he, i.e. the Prophet order you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He orders us to offer prayers; to give alms; to be chaste; and to keep good relations with our relatives.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father, seeing a silken cloak being sold, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is worn only by that person who will have no share in the Hereafter.&#8221; Later a few silken cloaks were given to the Prophet as a gift, and he sent one of those cloaks to &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet), &#8220;How can I wear it while you have said about it what you said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar sent it to his (pagan) brother who was from the inhabitants of Mecca before he (&#8216;Umar&#8217;s brother) embraced Islam.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Inform me of a deed which will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He has something to ask (what he needs greatly).&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and join none in worship with Him: You should offer prayers perfectly, give obligatory charity (Zakat), and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Leave it!&#8221; (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;It seems that the Prophet was riding his she camel.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Who ever is pleased that he be granted more wealth and that his lease of life be pro longed, then he should keep good relations with his Kith and kin.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever loves that he be granted more wealth and that his lease of life be prolonged then he should keep good relations with his Kith and kin.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created the creations, and when He finished from His creations, Ar-Rahm i.e., womb said, &#8220;(O Allah) at this place I seek refuge with You from all those who sever me (i.e. sever the ties of Kith and kin). Allah said, &#8216;Yes, won&#8217;t you be pleased that I will keep good relations with the one who will keep good relations with you, and I will sever the relation with the one who will sever the relations with you.&#8217; It said, &#8216;Yes, O my Lord.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Then that is for you &#8216; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added. &#8220;Read (in the Qur&#8217;an) if you wish, the Statement of Allah: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship?&#8217; (47.22)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The word &#8216;Ar-Rahm (womb) derives its name from Ar-Rahman (i.e., one of the names of Allah) and Allah said: &#8216;I will keep good relation with the one who will keep good relation with you, (womb i.e. Kith and Kin) and sever the relation with him who will sever the relation with you, (womb, i.e. Kith and Kin).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet said, &#8220;The word &#8216;Ar-Rahm&#8217; (womb) derives its name from &#8216;Ar-Rahman&#8217; (i.e. Allah). So whosoever keeps good relations with it (womb i.e. Kith and kin), Allah will keep good relations with him, and whosoever will sever it (i.e. severs his bonds of Kith and kin) Allah too will sever His relations with him.</p>
<hr>

When the Prophet left, the man was blamed by his companions who said, &#8220;It was not nice on your part to ask the Prophet for it while you know that he took it because he was in need of it, and you also know that he (the Prophet) never turns down anybody&#8217;s request that he might be asked for.&#8221; That man said, &#8220;I just wanted to have its blessings as the Prophet had put it on, so l hoped that I might be shrouded in it.&#8221;</p>

So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.&#8221;</p>

And the hasty people went away, wondering. &#8220;Has the prayer been shortened&#8221; Among the people there was a man whom the Prophet used to call Dhul-Yadain (the longarmed). He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has it been shortened.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Surely, you have forgotten, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, Dhul-Yadain has told the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet got up and offered other two Rakat and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then he said Takbir, performed a prostration of ordinary duration or longer, then he raised his head and said Takbir and performed another prostration of ordinary duration or longer and then raised his head and said Takbir (i.e. he performed the two prostrations of Sahu, i.e., forgetfulness).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) that she was told that &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (on hearing that she was selling or giving something as a gift) said, &#8220;By Allah, if &#8216;Aisha does not give up this, I will declare her incompetent to dispose of her wealth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) say so?&#8221; They (people) said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I vow to Allah that I will never speak to Ibn Az-Zubair.&#8221; When this desertion lasted long, &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sought intercession with her, but she said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him, and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow.&#8221; When this state of affairs was prolonged on Ibn Az-Zubair (he felt it hard on him), he said to Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth, who were from the tribe of Bani Zahra, &#8220;I beseech you, by Allah, to let me enter upon &#8216;Aisha, for it is unlawful for her to vow to cut the relation with me.&#8221; So Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, wrapping their sheets around themselves, asked &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s permission saying, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings be upon you! Shall we come in?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Come in.&#8221; They said, &#8220;All of us?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, come in all of you,&#8221; not knowing that Ibn Az-Zubair was also with them. So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of &#8216;Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur Rahman also started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said (to her), &#8220;The Prophet forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days).&#8221; So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others&#8217; sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, &#8220;I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one.&#8221; They (Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about &#8220;Al-Luqata&#8221; (a lost fallen purse or a thing picked up by somebody). The Prophet said, &#8220;You should announce it publicly for one year, and then remember and recognize the tying material of its container, and then you can spend it. If its owner came to you, then you should pay him its equivalent.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Take it because it is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; The man again said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost camel?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle became very angry and furious and his cheeks became red (or his face became red), and he said, &#8220;You have nothing to do with it (the camel) for it has its food and its water container with it till it meets its owner.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle made a small room (with a palm leaf mat). Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out (of his house) and prayed in it. Some men came and joined him in his prayer. Then again the next night they came for the prayer, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle delayed and did not come out to them. So they raised their voices and knocked the door with small stones (to draw his attention). He came out to them in a state of anger, saying, &#8220;You are still insisting (on your deed, i.e. Tarawih prayer in the mosque) that I thought that this prayer (Tarawih) might become obligatory on you. So you people, offer this prayer at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is the one which he offers at home, except the compulsory (congregational) prayer.&#8221;</p>

Only if he said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast.&#8217; &#8221; So they said to that (furious) man, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you hear what the Prophet is saying?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not mad.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">But when he entered, the Prophet spoke to him gently in a polite manner. I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

I hope that you will have a long life, and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed, is multiplied ten times, that means, as if you fasted the whole year.&#8221; I insisted (on fasting more) so I was given a hard instruction.

So I was sure that my father would be angry with me. When he came, I went away (to hide myself) from him. He asked, &#8220;What have you done (about the guests)?&#8221; They informed him the whole story. Abu Bakr called, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur Rahman!&#8221; I kept quiet.

I beseech you by Allah, if you hear my voice, then come out!&#8221; I came out and said, &#8220;Please ask your guests (and do not be angry with me).&#8221; They said, &#8220;He has told the truth; he brought the meal to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As you have been waiting for me, by Allah, I will not eat of it tonight.&#8221; They said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not eat of it till you eat of it.&#8221; He said, I have never seen a night like this night in evil. What is wrong with you? Why don&#8217;t you accept your meals of hospitality from us?&#8221; (He said to me), &#8220;Bring your meal.&#8221; I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, &#8220;In the name of Allah.

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;All that happened was from Satan.&#8221; So he asked for the meals and ate of it, and so did they. Whenever they took a handful of the meal, the meal grew (increased) from underneath more than that mouthful. He said (to his wife), &#8220;O, sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8221; She said, &#8220;O, pleasure of my eyes! The meal is now more than it had been before we started eating&#8221; So they ate of it and sent the rest of that meal to the Prophet.

The Prophet said, &#8220;Will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man,&#8221; (or said, &#8220;..your companion&#8221;). They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The murder was a thing we did not witness.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the Jews will release you from the oath, if fifty of them (the Jews) should take an oath to contradict your claim.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

When nobody spoke, the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree&#8221; When I came out with my father, I said, &#8220;O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What prevented you from saying it?&#8221; Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune).&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor Abu Bakr spoke, so I disliked to speak (in your presence).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most true words said by a poet were the words of Labid. He said, i.e. &#8216;Verily, everything except Allah is perishable and Umaiya bin Abi As-Salt was about to embrace Islam &#8216;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 169:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar and we travelled during the night. A man amongst the people said to &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa&#8217;, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, and so he got down and started (chanting Huda) reciting for the people, poetry that keep pace with the camel&#8217;s foot steps, saying, &#8220;O Allah! Without You we would not have been guided on the right path, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed. Let all of us be sacrificed for Your cause and when we meet our enemy, make our feet firm and bestow peace and calmness on us and if they (our enemy) will call us towards an unjust thing we will refuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The infidels have made a hue and cry to ask others help against us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is that driver (of the camels)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa.&#8221;&#8216; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His mercy on him.&#8221; A man among the people said, Has Martyrdom been granted to him, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; We reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were stricken with severe hunger but Allah helped the Muslims conquer Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are those fires? For what are you making fires?&#8221; They said, &#8220;For cooking meat.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Donkeys&#8217; meat.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the cooking pots.&#8221; A man said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You can do that too.&#8221; When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit &#8216;Amir&#8217;s knee and caused him to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw me pale and said, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds of Amir have been annulled.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Who said so?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari said, &#8216;Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, &#8216;Amir will have double reward.&#8221;&#8216; (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers together to indicate that, and added, &#8220;He was really a hard-working man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Allah&#8217;s Cause) and rarely have there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an &#8220;Arab like him.&#8221;</p>

Who else would act justly if I did not act justly?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Allow me to chop his neck off.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, for he has companions (who are apparently so pious that) if anyone of (you compares his prayer with) their prayer, he will consider his prayer inferior to theirs, and similarly his fasting inferior to theirs, but they will desert Islam (go out of religion) as an arrow goes through the victim&#8217;s body (games etc.) in which case if its Nasl is examined nothing will be seen thereon, and if its Nady is examined, nothing will be seen thereon, and if its Qudhadh is examined, nothing will be seen thereon, for the arrow has gone out too fast even for the excretions and blood to smear over it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d! Didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habab said?&#8221; (meaning &#8216;Abdullah bin Unbar). &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: &#8216;You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you&#8230;..and from the pagans (3.186)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8216;Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. &#8230;. (2.109) So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah&#8217;s Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)&#8221;. Then they became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(One night) the Prophet woke up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah ! How many treasures have been (disclosed) sent down! And how many afflictions have been descended! Who will go and wake the sleeping lady-occupants up of these dwellings (for praying)?&#8221; (He meant by this his wives.) The Prophet added, &#8220;A well-dressed soul (person) in this world may be naked in the &#8220;Hereafter.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I asked the Prophet, &#8216;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safiya bint Huyai:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wife of the Prophet that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in Itikaf (staying in the mosque) during the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. She spoke to him for an hour (a while) at night and then she got up to return home. The Prophet got up to accompany her, and when they reached the gate of the mosque opposite the dwelling place of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by, and greeting Allah&#8217;s Apostle , they quickly went ahead. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;Do not be in a hurry She is Safiya, the daughter of Huyai.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (how dare we suspect you).&#8221; That was a great thing for both of them. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Satan runs in the body of Adam&#8217;s son (i.e. man) as his blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that he (Satan) might insert an evil thought in your hearts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mughaffal Al-Muzani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forbade the throwing of stones (with the thumb and the index or middle finger), and said &#8220;It neither hunts a game nor kills (or hurts) an enemy, but it gouges out an eye or breaks a tooth.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men sneezed before the Prophet. The Prophet said to one of them, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on you,&#8221; but he did not say that to the other. On being asked (why), the Prophet said, &#8220;That one praised Allah (at the time of sneezing), while the other did not praise Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ordered us to do seven (things) and forbade us from seven (other things): He ordered us to pay a visit to the sick, to follow funeral possessions, to say: May Allah be merciful to you to a sneezer, &#8211; if he says: Praise be to Allah, to accept invitation (invitation to a wedding banquet), to return greetings, to help the oppressed, and to help others to fulfill their oaths (provided it was not sinful). And he forbade us from seven (things): to wear golden rings or golden bangles, to wear silk (cloth), Dibaj, Sundus and Mayathir.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah likes sneezing and dislikes yawning, so if someone sneezes and then praises Allah, then it is obligatory on every Muslim who heard him, to say: May Allah be merciful to you (Yar-hamuka-l-lah). But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so one must try one&#8217;s best to stop it, if one says &#8216;Ha&#8217; when yawning, Satan will laugh at him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8221; If anyone of you sneezes, he should say &#8216;Al-Hamdulillah&#8217; (Praise be to Allah), and his (Muslim) brother or companion should say to him, &#8216;Yar-hamuka-l-lah&#8217; (May Allah bestow his Mercy on you). When the latter says &#8216;Yar-hamuka-llah&#8221;, the former should say, &#8216;Yahdikumul-lah wa Yuslih balakum&#8217; (May Allah give you guidance and improve your condition).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men sneezed before the Prophet and he said Tashmit to one of them, while he did not say Tashmit to the other. So that man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said Tashmit to that fellow but you did not say Tashmit to me. &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;That man praised Allah, but you did not praise Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah loves sneezing but dislikes yawning; so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises Allah, every Muslim who hears him (praising Allah) has to say Tashmit to him. But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so if one of you yawns, he should try his best to stop it, for when anyone of you yawns, Satan laughs at him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">28- On the authority of Hamzah bin Suhaib on the authority of his father who said that Umar said to Suhaib: You are a great man but would that you didn’t have three characteristics!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: And what are they?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: You have taken a kuniya (nickname) but you don&#8217;t have a son. You ascribe yourself to the Arabs but you are from Rome and you waste food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib replied: As for your saying: “You have taken a kuniya (nickname) but you don&#8217;t have a son”, rather the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – gave me a kuniya, Abu Yahya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying: that I ascribed my self to the Arabs and that I&#8217;m not from them but that I&#8217;m from Rome. Rather, I am a person from an-Nimar bin Qaasit and I was taken as a prisoner from Mousil to Rome while I was a child and knew my lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying: that I waste food. Rather, I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – saying: &#8216;The best of you are those who feed people.&#8217;<br>
No.44</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29- On the authority of Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amroo on the authority of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who said: &#8216;The pleasure of your Lord is in pleasing your father. And the anger of your Lord is in making your father angry.&#8217;<br>
No.516</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30- On the authority of Abu Huraira, on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who said: &#8216;Musa asked his Lord about six characteristics, which he thought were only and purely for him alone and he did not like the seventh one.<br>
1- He asked: &#8216;O my Lord! Which of your slaves are the most pious?<br>
He answered: He who/the one who remembers Allaah and does not forget.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- He asked: &#8216;Which of your slaves are the most guided?<br>
He answered: the one who follows the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- He asked: Which of your slaves is the best in judgement?<br>
He answered: the one who judges for the people just as he judges for his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- He asked: Which of your slaves is the most knowledgeable?<br>
He answered: The one who is not satisfied and always has a thirst for knowledge, he adds the knowledge of the people to his knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- He asked: which of your slaves are the most honourable?<br>
He answered: The one who has the capability to forgive, then forgives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- He asked: Which of your slaves is the most content?<br>
He answered: The one who is pleased with what he is given.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- He asked: Which of your slaves is the neediest?<br>
He answered: The one who utilizes what he has and always requires more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: Satisfaction is not that which is apparent; indeed satisfaction is satisfaction of the self/soul. If Allaah intends good for His slave then He places satisfaction in his soul and his Taqwa (piety) in his heart. And if Allaah intends evil for a slave then He places poverty where ever he turns.&#8217;<br>
No. 3350</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31- On the authority of &#8216;Alee who said: when I held onto the weapon of Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – I found a slip of paper in the sheath of the sword (scabbard) of Allaah’s Messenger which had on it: &#8216;Keep good relations with the one who breaks away from you. Be good to the one who is bad to you and say the truth even if it is against yourself.&#8217;<br>
No. 1911</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32- On the authority of Anas who said: There was a man who was with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – the man&#8217;s son came, he kissed him and sat him on his lap. His daughter came and he just sat her next to him. The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: &#8216;If only you had been just between them!&#8217; No.3098</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">10- On the authority of Anas who said: that the Messenger of Allaah said to a man: &#8216;O such and such! You did this? He answered: &#8216;No, I swear by Allaah other than whom there is no god!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- knew that he had indeed done that thing, so he said to him: &#8216;Indeed Allaah has forgiven your lying, due to your certainty of &#8216;La illaah illa Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- On the authority of Abdullaah who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Verily Allaah has distributed your manners between yourselves just like He distributed your provisions between yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gives the Duniya (world) to the one He loves and the one whom He doesn&#8217;t love, but He doesn&#8217;t give Emaan (faith) except to the one whom He loves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever is too miserly with his wealth to spend it, and is too fearful to fight the enemy, and is too weak to stand the night in prayer, then he should say &#8216;SubhanAllaah, wal-Hamdulillaah, wa la illah ill Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar.&#8217; a lot.<br>
No. 2714</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12- On the authority of al-Miqdam bin Ma&#8217;adee Karb al-Kindee on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who said: &#8216;Indeed Allaah orders you to fulfill the rights of your mothers, then to fulfill the rights of close relatives then those who are after them.&#8217;<br>
No.1666</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13- On the authority of Anas who said: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to have a she-camel named al-Udbaa&#8217;, and it could not be beaten in a race.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin came with his camel, and it beat al-Udbaa&#8217;. This was difficult for the Muslims, and they said &#8216;al-Udbaa&#8217; has been beaten!&#8217; On that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Indeed it is a right upon Allaah, that He does not raise anything in this world except that He lowers it.&#8217;<br>
No.3525</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14- On the authority of &#8216;Aeysha who said: that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Indeed a man reaches the level of the one who prays the night prayer and fasts during the day, due to his good manners.&#8217;<br>
No.795</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15- On the authority of Umaarah bin Khuzaimah bin Thaabit: that his father said: I dreamt as if I was prostrating on the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- forehead. I informed the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- of this, and he said: &#8216;Indeed a soul meets another soul [in another narration: sit down, prostrate and do what you saw.]&#8217; The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- tilted his head like this &#8211; [&#8216;Affaan said: with his head backwards] &#8211; then he placed his forehead on the forehead of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.<br>
No.3262</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16- On the authority of Abu Huraira: that a man mentioned: O Messenger of Allaah! Indeed I have close relatives, I keep good relations with them but they turn away from me. I am good to them but they are bad to me. I&#8217;m gentle to them and they are harsh with me. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;If it is as you say then it is as if you feed them hot ashes, you will continue to have assistance from Allaah as long as you are upon this way.&#8217;<br>
No. 2597</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17- On the authority of Anas bin Malik who said: some guests from Bahrain came to visit the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. The Prophet requested for some water for wudu, and he made wudu. They rushed to the water from his wudu, and they drank whatever they could from it. Whatever poured on to the ground, they wiped their faces, heads and chests with it. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to them: &#8216;what made you do this?&#8217; they said: for the love of you, perhaps Allaah will love us O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said : &#8216;If you love that Allaah and His Messenger will love you, then continue to have three characteristics: truthful speech, fulfilling trusts and being good to your neighbour; if the neighbour is harmed, your good deeds are erased just like the sun melts an ice-berg.&#8217;<br>
No. 2998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18- The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: &#8216;Indeed every religion has a characteristic and the characteristic of Islaam is modesty.&#8217;<br>

No. 570</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said: this is on my side of the land! And I said: It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said: ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa salaam – to order you to say it.<br>
So I said: ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr &#8211; RadhiAllaahuanhu- went off to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabiah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’<br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, do not be hasty.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he stood for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: ‘It is not that I loved to see them, but I loved that what would reach the women was his status with me and my status with him.’<br>

The Day of Judgement will not be established until obscenity and miserliness appear; when a trustworthy person will be cheated and a cheater will be trusted, when al-Waaool will be destroyed and at-Toohowat will appear.’<br>
They asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah What is al-Waaol and what is at-Toohawat?’<br>
He said: ‘al-Waaool are the leaders and the noble people and at-Toohowat are those who are under the feet of the people and are disregarded.’<br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His son Abdullaah ibn Abdullaah said: ‘I swear by The One Who has been generous to you and revealed the Book to you if you want I will bring his head to you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘No, but rather, be good to your father and maintain good companionship with him.’<br>
No. 3223</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62- 196 &#8211; On the authority al-Qaasim bin Muhammad who said that Abdullaah bin Hanzala claimed that Abdullaah bin Salam passed by in the market who had a bundle of wood. So it was said to him: ‘Has Allaah not enriched you?’</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen<br>
</span>Makaarim-ul-Akhlaaq (pg. 32-35)<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This is a chapter from the book &#8220;<i>Makaarim-ul-Akhlaaq</i>&#8221; (pg. 32-35) [Dar-ul-Watan Lin-Nashr] By Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, prepared and arranged by Khaalid Abu Saalih.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned previously that good manners can either be present in someone naturally or they can be instilled into him (i.e. through learning). And we stated that inherent good manners are better than acquired good manners. We mentioned a proof for this which was the Messenger of Allaah’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement to Al-Ashaj bin ‘Abdil-Qais (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>): <b>“Rather, Allaah has molded (i.e. created) you upon these two (noble characteristics).”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also because good manners that are innate do not disappear from a human being whereas good manners that are acquired may vanish from a person in many instances since it requires constant practice and effort as well as exercise and hard work. It also requires that one be reminded of it whenever there occurs something that affects a human being. This is why when a man once came to the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah, advise me”, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Do not get angry.”</b> The man then repeated his request several times, upon which the Prophet continued to reply: <b>“Do not get angry.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said: <b>“The strong person is not the one who wrestles and overpowers his opponents. Rather the strong person is the one who controls himself in times of anger.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a strong person is not someone who wrestles with people and overpowers them, He is someone <b>“who controls himself in times of anger.”</b> He takes hold of himself and restrains himself during instances when he becomes angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person controlling himself in times of anger is considered a characteristic of good manners. So if you become angry, do not let your anger penetrate, rather seek refuge in Allaah from the accursed Devil. And if you are standing, then sit down. If you are sitting, then lie down. And if your anger increases, then perform ablution (<i>wudoo</i>) until it goes away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person may acquire and earn good manners by way of training (himself), working hard at it and through constant practice. So he may obtain good manners through one of the following methods:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> By contemplating on the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger: One should look up the texts that show the virtue of the particular noble characteristic that he wishes to characterize himself with. This is since when a believer sees some texts that praise a characteristic or action, he implements them. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) indicated this when he said: <b>“The example of a good companion and an evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and a blacksmith. The seller of musk either sells you (perfume), gives you free samples or you get a pleasing smell from him. As for the example of an evil companion – such as a blacksmith – he either burns your clothes or you get a nasty smell from him.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>He should accompany those who are known for having good manners whilst staying far away from those who possess bad manners and poor actions. This is such that he turns this companionship of his into an educational institute that assists him in (his goal of) obtaining good manners. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“A man is upon the religion of his close friend, so let each of you look into whom he takes as a close friend.” </b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: </b>He should reflect on the consequences that come as a result of having bad manners. This is since a person with bad manners is despised. A person with bad manners is forsaken. A person with bad manners is always talked about in a bad way. So when one comes to realize that bad manners will lead him to all of this, he will then keep away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourth: </b>He should always envision an image of the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) manners and how he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would humble himself before the creation, being kind to them, forgiving to them and patient with their harm. So if a person visualizes the Prophet’s character and the fact that he was the best of mankind and the greatest of those who worshipped Allaah, he will then perceive a low image of himself and at this point the influence that arrogance has over him will be shattered and this will cause him to have good manners.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Abu Dawood (no. 5335), Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad</i> (4/206), Muslim with only the first part of it (no. 25 &amp; 26), and At-Tirmidhee (no. 2011)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6116) and At-Tirmidhee (no. 2020)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6114) and Muslim (no. 107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Purification (of the soul) cannot be achieved except by way of the messengers as stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim when he said: “Purifying the souls is harder and more difficult than curing the bodies. So whoever purifies his soul through exercise, hard work and being in isolation – all of which the messengers did not come with – he is like a sick person that tries to cure himself based on his own opinion. Where is his opinion with respect to the expertise of a doctor?! The messengers are the doctors of the hearts – there is no way to purify and rectify the hearts except through their way, at their hands and by totally submitting and complying with them. And we ask Allaah for His assistance!” [Madaarij-us-Saalikeen (2/300)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2101 &amp; 5534) and Muslim (no. 146); An-Nawawee said: “This shows the virtue of accompanying righteous and good people – those who possess chivalry, good manners, piety, knowledge, and good behavior. It also shows the prohibition of accompanying evil people, innovators, and those who backbite people or who are very wicked and so on, i.e. other types of condemnable characteristics.” [See <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i>: (16/394)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by At-Tirmidhee (no. 2378) who said it was <i>hasan saheeh</i>, Abu Dawood (no. 4833), Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad </i>(2/303, 334) and deemed <i>hasan </i> (sound) by Al-Albaanee in <i>Saheeh-ul-Jaami’ as-Sagheer</i> (no. 3545) and <i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</i> (no. 927).</p>
