<p>Abee Zayd al-Qayrawaanee, (the Imam famous well known as, Malik As-Sagheer) (May Allah have mercy on him) says:</p>



<p><strong>“The narrations of morals and manners have been combined into four narrations”</strong></p>



<p>The Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said: <br /><strong>“Whoever believes in Allah and the last day then let him say (a word that is) good or be silent.”</strong></p>



<p>And the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said: <br /><strong>“From the goodness of a person’s Islam is that he leaves off that which does not concern him.”</strong></p>



<p>Also, the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said to the one who sought advice from him: <br /><strong>“Do not become angry!”</strong></p>



<p>Likewise, the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wa Sallam) said: <br /><strong>“None of you (truly) believes until he loves for his brother, what he loves for himself.”</strong></p>



<p>Hence, these four narrations- are all from forty hadeeth of the narrations regarding morals and manners-collected by Imam Nawawee (May Allah be pleased with him).</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Chapter 7: The Soul Inclines Towards Evil</strong></span></p>
<p>The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(human)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His Mercy </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(upon whom He wills)</span>. &gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence for the description of the essence of the soul &#8211; it does not leave this description of inclining towards evil except with Allaah’s mercy and concern from Him, because the soul is <strong>oppressive</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong>. Nothing comes from oppression and ignorance except every evil. Therefore, if Allaah has mercy on His slave and blesses him with <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and makes him follow a <strong>path of justice</strong> in his manners and his actions, then his soul loses this description, finds tranquility in the obedience of Allaah and His remembrance and does not command its companion except to do good, and this leads to the grace of Allaah and His reward. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ  ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَّرْضِيَّةً  فَادْخُلِي فِي عِبَادِي  وَادْخُلِي جَنَّتِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">(It will be said to the pious)<strong>: ‘O </strong>(you) <strong>the one in </strong>(complete) <strong>rest and satisfaction! ‘Come back to your Lord, Well-pleased </strong>(yourself)<strong> and well-pleasing unto Him! ‘Enter you, then, among My honoured slaves, &#8220;And enter you My Paradise!’</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fajr: 27-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is upon the slave of Allaah to work on himself to rectify his soul, and to take this despised characteristic out of it, which is that the soul inclines towards evil. This is done by striving and having the best of manners, asking Allaah to be continuous upon that and repeating the following narrated supplication plentifully:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">‘<strong>O Allaah guide me to the best of actions and manners, no-one guides to the best of them except You, and turn me away from evil actions and evil manners no-one can turn me away from their evil except You.</strong>’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim &amp; Tirmidhi]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[PS: Arabic version of the above supplication is added below by AbdurRahman.Org for memorization of this important supplication]</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي لِأَحْسَنِ الْأَعْمَالِ وَأَحْسَنِ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَهْدِي لِأَحْسَنِهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> وَقِنِي سَيِّئَ الْأَعْمَالِ وَسَيِّئَ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَقِي سَيِّئَهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ</strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 131</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The blameless one from the Muslims is the one from whom nothing suspicious becomes apparent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F408965550&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-blameless-muslim-is-the-one-from-whom-nothing-suspicious-becomes-apparent" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech</strong>.” [<em>Saheeh</em> – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one’s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Excellent Example</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>‘<strong>Aqeedah</strong></em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his <strong>worship</strong>, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam – </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character</strong> &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> as an example in their <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa’</em> will be successful <em>– InshAllaah –</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa’</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa’</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa’</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa’</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa’</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness – and the likes of these things – then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa’</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa’</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1771 – From Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was brought some milk that was blended with water and on his right was a Bedouin and on his left was Abu Bakr, so he drank from it then he gave it to the Bedouin and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘On the right on the right.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: ‘those on the right, those on the right, you should give it on the right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1771</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth, the one who was serving the drinks began with the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>was the one who requested a drink. Therefore, it is not correct to use this hadeeth as an evidence to prove that the Sunnah is to essentially begin with the eldest of the people as is widespread nowadays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can this be the case when the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>himself did not do this, on the contrary the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>gave the drink to the Bedouin who was on his right hand side and not to Abu Bakr who was on his left hand side, then the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>explained by saying: ‘On the right hand side then the next one after him.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Imam AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jareer bin Abdullaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫من لا يرحم الناس لا يرحمه الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does not have mercy upon the people then Allaah does not have mercy upon him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi (d. 1376 A.H.) commented on this hadeeth saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The literal wording of the hadeeth indicates that the one who does not have mercy upon the people then Allaah does not have mercy upon him. The understanding of the hadeeth is that whoever has mercy upon the people, then Allaah has mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said in another hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘الراحمون يرحمهم الرحمن. ارحموا من في الأرض؛ يرحمكم من في السماء<strong>‘</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>ar-Rahman</em> (The Most Merciful) has mercy upon Merciful people. Have mercy upon those on the earth, and the One above the skies will have mercy upon you.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the mercy a slave of Allaah has for the creation is from the greatest means by which the mercy of Allaah is acquired. From the effects of that mercy is goodness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and goodness in the Hereafter. From the greatest means of Allaah’s mercy being blocked and prevented is if the slave of Allaah does not have mercy to the creation. The slave of Allaah is in great need and dire want of Allaah’s mercy, he cannot do without it for even the blink of an eye, and he cannot do without this mercy due to what it contains of blessings and repelling of punishment from the mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, when a person wants the mercy of Allaah to continue and increase, then he needs to implement all the means by which the mercy of Allaah is gained. All of these means are combined in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّ رَحْمَتَ اللّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good. &gt;&gt; [Ara’af: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are doers of good (<em>al-Muhsinoon</em>) in the worship of Allaah, and they are <em>al-Muhsinoon</em> to the worshippers of Allaah. The <em>Ihsaan</em> (being good) to the creation has an effect from the effects of the mercy that the slave of Allaah has with the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of mercy that the slave of Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First type:</strong> Natural &amp; innate mercy</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has granted some of His slaves this mercy.  He placed compassion, mercy and sympathy in their hearts for the creation.  These slaves of Allaah carryout what they are capable of in benefitting the people and this is what this mercy necessitates and they do so according to their capabilities. They are praised, and rewarded for what they do, and they are excused for that in which they fall short on, and perhaps Allaah wrote a reward for them, due to their truthful intentions even though their strength was not enough to carry out those actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second type</strong> is the mercy that a slave of Allaah acquires by following every path and means in order to characterize his heart with this mercy. The slave of Allaah knows that this description is from the most noble and most complete of manners and behavior.  He strives to characterize himself with it, and he is aware of the reward that Allaah has prepared for being merciful, and what he loses, if he is prohibited from this reward.  He desires excellence from his Lord, and he strives with all the different means to acquire that excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah knows that the reward is equivalent to the type of action carried out, and he knows that Allaah has ordained a religious brotherhood, and a love based on <em>Eemaan</em> between the Believers. Allaah ordered the believers to be brothers loving each other, and to eliminate everything that negates brotherhood from hatred, enmity and evil plotting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah continues to be acquainted with the means by which he acquires this noble characteristic of being merciful, and he exerts himself in implementing this characteristic so much so that he fills his heart up with this mercy, and sympathy for the creation. How great is this noble manner, and noble and complete characteristic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of this mercy, which is in the hearts, becomes evident upon the limbs and the tongue in striving to do good, righteousness and relaying benefits to the people, and to discontinue harm, and being compelling and offensive to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sign that shows the presence of mercy in the heart of the slave of Allaah is that he loves that goodness reaches all of the creation generally, and specifically to the Muslims, and he dislikes that evil and harm reaches them. And will be in relation to the level of love and dislike he has, and will be in relation to the level of mercy that he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is afflicted by the death of a beloved person or by other afflictions, and if his sadness upon that person or affliction is due to feeling merciful, then this sadness is praiseworthy, and it does not negate patience and seeking Allaah’s pleasure, this is because when the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> cried due to the death of his grandson, Sa’ad said to him: ‘What is this O Messenger of Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> followed up his question with another statement and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘هذه رحمة يجعلها الله في قلوب عباده، وإنما يرحم الله من عباده الرحماء’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is mercy, which Allaah places in the hearts of His slaves.  Indeed those whom Allaah has mercy upon from His slaves are those who are merciful.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said at the death of his son Ibraheem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘القلب يحزن، والعين تدمع، ولا نقول إلا ما يرضي ربنا. وإنَّا لفراقك يا إبراهيم لمحزونون’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The heart is saddened, the eyes shed tears, but we only say that which pleases our Lord. And indeed we are saddened by your separation O Ibraheem.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise having mercy upon young children and slaves, and making them happy is also from being merciful­.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for not having concern for them and not having gentleness with them, then this is from coarseness, harshness and cruelty, just like some of the coarseness of the Bedouins when they saw the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and his companions kissing their younger children, one of the Bedouins said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have ten children I did not even kiss one of them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘أو أملك لك شيئاً أن نزع الله من قلبك الرحمة؟’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘How can I hold something for you, with Allaah has removed mercy from your heart?’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, an example of being merciful is the mercy that the prostitute had when she gave water to a dog to drink, he was going to eat dirt due to extreme thirst, and Allaah forgave her due to that mercy.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of that example is how a woman was punished due to her tying up a cat, she did not feed her or give her drink, nor did she leave her to eat from the leftovers on the earth, until that cat died.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally from this mercy is that which has been witnessed and experienced, and that is that whoever is kind to his animals by giving them food and drink and beneficial consideration, then Allaah blesses him regarding his animals, and whoever is evil to them, then he is punished in the <em>Dunya</em> before the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَى بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land – it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Maidah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the first heart has cruelty, harshness and evil, whereas the other heart has mercy and gentleness and compassion, and he is concerned with reviving all those people from whom he has the ability to revive, in comparison to the first heart which has cruelty, and is prepared to annihilate all the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to place mercy in our hearts which will obligate us to follow all the ways that gain the mercy of Allaah, and that we sympathize with all the creation of Allaah due to this mercy. And that Allaah makes it a way of gaining Allaah’s mercy and His generosity; indeed He is the Bestower of goodness and the Most Kind.</p>

<p>Al-Imam Ishaq bin Rahawayyah (d.238 A.H.) said:</p>
<p>‘Allaah Ta’ala said: &lt;&lt;The Most Merciful [who is] above the Throne established.&gt;&gt; [Taha: 5]. There is a consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>) of the people of knowledge that Allaah is<em>Mustawaa’</em> (ascended) above the ‘<em>Arsh</em> (Throne), and He knows every single thing under the seven earths.’</p>
<p>Ad-Dhahabi commented on this statement in ‘al-‘Aloo’:</p>

<p>‘The statement of the Imams of Islaam, the Sunnah and the <em>Jammaah</em> is that we know that our Lord is above the sevens, above His ‘<em>Arsh</em> (Throne), like He said: &lt;&lt;The Most Merciful [who is] above the Throne established.&gt;&gt; [Taha: 5]</p>
<p>Ad-Dhahabi commented on this statement in ‘al-‘Uloo’:</p>
<p>‘So this is Qutaibah, being a great trustworthy Imam, who conveyed a consensus of this issue. He had met Malik, Layth, Hammad bin Zayd, the senior scholars and he lived a long life and the memorizers of hadeeth used to crowd around at his door.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From those Mannerisms that are Obligatory with Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>136 </strong>– From Qateelah bint Seefee a woman from Juhaynah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed a monk came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘You people commit <em>Shirk</em>! You say whatever Allaah wills and whatever you will, and you say I swear by the <em>Ka’abah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Say whatever Allaah wills, <strong>then</strong>what you will, and say I swear by <strong>the Lord of the Ka’abah</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Tahawi in ‘al-Mushkil’ and al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad. Al-Albaani said its chain is <em>Saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>137</strong> – From Hudhayfah who narrates the same hadeeth: ‘Whereby the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills and what so and so wills, but rather say: whatever Allaah wills <strong>then</strong> what so and so wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood and Tahaawi  in  ‘Mushkil al-Athaar’ and Bayhaqi and Ahmad. Al-Albaani said its chain is Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rabaee bin Harash followed up Abdullah bin Yasser on the authority of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘I saw in a dream that I met some people of the book and they said you are a blessed people if it were not that you say, whatever Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills’, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Indeed I used to dislike that for you to say whatever Allaah wills then what Muhammad wills’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ibn Majah and Ahmad, Shaykh al-Albaani said that from what is apparent the hadeeth is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>138</strong> – From at-Tufayl bin Sakhbrah the brother of Aeysha from the same mother: ‘That he saw what a sleeping person sees (dreams), it was as if he passed by a group of  the Jews.  He asked: ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are Jews.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said: ‘Indeed you are the people, if only you did not claim that Uzayr is the son of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews said: ‘And you are the people, if only you did not say: ‘Whatever Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he passed by a group of the Christians.  He asked: ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are Christians.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said: ‘Indeed you are the people, if only you did not claim that the Messiah is the son of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christians said: ‘And you are the people, if only you did not say: ‘Whatever Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the morning he informed those whom he informed, then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came and he informed him of what he saw in the dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked him: ‘Did you inform anyone?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> had prayed he gave them a<em>Khutbah</em>, and praised Allaah and glorified Him, then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Tufayl saw a dream, and he informed whosoever from amongst you, and indeed you used to say a statement, and shyness used to prevent me from prohibiting you from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills <strong>and</strong>what Muhammad wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>139</strong>&#8211; From Ibn Abbas who said: A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> to ask about something then he said: ‘Whatever Allaah wills and what you will.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Have you made me an equal with Allaah (in another wording: a partner)?! No, but rather, what Allaah Alone wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’, Ibn Majah, Tahawi in ‘al-Mushkil’, Bayhaqi, Ahmad, Tabrani and Albaani said its chain is Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fiqh of the Hadeeth:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: ‘In these Ahadeeth we find, that when a man says to someone else: ‘Whatever Allaah wills <strong>and</strong> what you will’ then this is regarded as <em>Shirk</em> in the <em>Sharia’</em>. This is from <em>Shirk</em> in wording, because it is presumed that the will of the slave of Allaah is that of the level of the will of the Lord – <em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em>; the reason being that there is a connection between the two wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The like of this are the statements of some of the common folk and those similar to them who claim to have knowledge: ‘I have no one except Allaah and you’, and ‘we have relied upon Allaah and you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are the statements of some of those who deliver  lectures: ‘In the name of Allaah and the country.’ Or ‘In the name of Allaah and the people.’ And there are various other similar wordings of <em>Shirk</em> which it is obligatory to stop using, and to repent from using them; in order to have correct manners with Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed many of the common folk have been negligent of this noble mannerism, likewise there are of the specific people (who claim to have knowledge) who justify their utterances such as these statements of <em>Shirk</em>.  Like calling on other than Allaah at times of hardship, and seeking help from the dead from amongst the righteous people and swearing by them and not by Allaah – <em>Ta’ala</em>, and swearing by them above Allaah<em>– Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah criticizes them for this, rather than helping the scholar to forbid the evil, they show enmity by criticizing  him, and they say: ‘Indeed the intentions of these people who call on other than Allaah is good! And actions are but by intentions, as found in the hadeeth!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are ignorant or pretend to be ignorant – to please the common folk – they claim that the intention is good, you find this amongst the previously mentioned people; and it does not make an evil action into a good action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the previously mentioned Ahadeeth is that good actions are with sincere intentions, not that actions which oppose the <em>Sharia’</em> are converted to legislated good actions due to being similar to a good action, this is something which only an ignorant biased person says!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that if a man prays towards a grave; then this would be an evil action even though he is praying; and this is due to his opposition to the Ahadeeth and the Aathaar which are mentioned about the prohibition against facing a grave for prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So would an intelligent person say: to the one who returns to face the grave – after having knowledge that the <em>Sharia’</em> has prohibited this – that his intention is good and his action is permissible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would never happen,  also those who seek deliverance and aid with other than Allaah, forgetting Allaah Ta’ala due to the circumstances in which they are in, they are in need of Allaah’s aid and help much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not intelligible that their end will be good, let alone that their action will be good, while they continue upon this evil knowingly.’</p>

<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part A</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- 205 – On the authority of Abu Huraira, on the authority of Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I order you with three and I prohibit you from three; I order you to worship Allaah and not to associate anyone with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hold together to the Rope of Allaah and do not separate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Obey the one whom Allaah places as a ruler over you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I prohibit you from gossip, asking too many questions and wasting wealth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 685</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- 206 -On the authority of Jaabir bin Sulayman or Saleem that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> while he was sitting with his Companions, I asked: ‘Which one of you is the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>? Either the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> gestured to himself or the people motioned to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was sitting with his knees against his chest with a garment and its trimming had covered his feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! I am ignorant about things so teach me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Fear Allaah <em>&#8211; Azza wa Jal &#8211;</em>, do not scorn any good deed even if you pour from a bucket into a vessel for the person who serves drinks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware of arrogance! Indeed Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabarak wa Ta’ala &#8211;</em> does not love arrogance. If a person curses you and disgraces you with something which he knows about you, then do not disgrace him with something you know about him, so you will have his reward and he will have his sin. Don’t you dare ever curse anyone.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.770</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- 208 – On the authority of Jaabir in a narration ascribed to the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The most beloved of food to Allaah is that which many hands partake of.’ No.895</p>

Which of the people are the most beloved to Allaah and which of the actions are most beloved to Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘The most beloved of the people to Allaah are the most beneficial for the people. The most beloved of actions to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> are to cause happiness to reach a Muslim, to relieve him from a hardship, to settle a debt for a Muslim or to repel hunger from him. For me to walk with a brother in order to assist him is more beloved to me than to make <em>‘Itikaf</em> in this <em>Masjid</em> (<em>Masjid</em> al-Madeenah) for a month.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever holds back his anger then Allaah hides his mistakes. Whoever suppresses his anger – even though he is not scared to show it, but withholds due to the truth – Allaah fills his heart with hope on the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever walks with his brother to assist him with a need until he has helped him completely, then Allaah plants his feet firmly on the day people will not stand firmly. Indeed bad behaviour spoils good actions, just as vinegar spoils honey.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 906</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If a noble person comes from a people, then be generous to him.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">7- 234- On the authority of Abu Huraira who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If one of you enters upon his Muslim brother and he feeds him from his food, then you should eat and not ask about it. And if he pours him a drink from his drink, then he should drink from his drink and not ask about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.627</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- 235 – The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If you see those who praise you, throw dirt in their faces.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.912</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- 268 – On the authority of Hisham on the authority of his father that ‘Aeysha said to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: O Messenger of Allaah! All your women have a <em>Kuniya</em> except me! So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Take a <em>Kuniya </em>by virtue of your son Abdullaah – i.e. Ibn Zubayr, you are Umm Abdullaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: ‘She was called Umm Abdullaah until she died and she had never given birth to a child.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.132</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">10- 269 – On the authority of Shaqeeq who said: Abdullaah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> said <em>Labbayik</em> while on the mountain of Safa. Then he said: ‘O tongue! Say good so you can benefit and remain silent so you are safe before you fall into regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu AbdurRahman! Is this something you yourself say or did you hear it?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘No, rather I heard the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say: ‘Most of the mistakes of the son of Aadam are due to his tongue.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 534</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- 274 – On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘O Allaah, indeed I make a pledge to You which I won’t break. Indeed I am a human being; so any believer who I harmed, reviled, cursed or punished; make that as prayer for him, <em>Zakat</em> and a means of being close to You on the Day of Judgement.’</p>

Chapter 140<br />
Seeking Permission to enter (somebody&#8217;s House) and Manners relating to it</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them.&#8221;</b></span><b> (24:27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age).&#8221;</b></span><b> (24:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>870.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Permission is to be sought thrice. If it is accorded, you may enter; otherwise, go back.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>871.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Seeking permission to enter (somebody&#8217;s house) has been prescribed in order to restrain the eyes (from looking at something we are not supposed to look at).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>872.</b> Rib`i bin Hirash (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man of Banu `Amir tribe has told us that he had asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for permission to enter when he was at home. He said: &#8220;May I enter?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the servant,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go out and instruct him about the manner of seeking permission.</span> Tell him to say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> As-Salamu `Alaikum (may you be safe from evil). May I come in?&#8221;</span> The man heard this and said: &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaikum (may you be safe from evil). May I come in?&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then accorded permission to him and he entered in.<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>873.</b> Kildah bin Al-Hanbal (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I visited the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and I entered his house without seeking permission. So he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go back and say: `As-Salamu `alaikum (may you be safe from evil). May I come in?&#8221;&#8217;</span><br />

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>623.</b> Sa`b bin Jaththamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I presented a wild ass to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as a gift but he returned it to me.

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>625.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) did not indulge in loose talk nor did he like to listen to it.

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>626.</b> Abud-Darda (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Nothing will be heavier on the Day of Resurrection in the Scale of the believer than good manners.

[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>627.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked about the deed which will be foremost to lead a man to Jannah. He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fear of Allah and the good conduct.&#8221;</span> Then he was asked about indulgence which will admit a man to Hell (Fire) and he answered,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The tongue and the genitals.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>628.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The most perfect man in his faith among the believers is the one whose behaviour is most excellent; and the best of you are those who are the best to their wives.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>629.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A believer will attain by his good behaviour the rank of one who prays during the night and observes fasting during the day.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 15<br />
The Righteous conduct on Regular base</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah &#8211; Islamic Monotheism) to be affected by Allah&#8217;s Reminder (this Qur&#8217;an), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before (i.e., Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened?&#8221;</b></span><b> (57:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And We sent `Isa (Jesus) &#8211; son of Maryam (Mary), and gave him the Injeel (Gospel). And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy. But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.&#8221;</b></span><b> (57:27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (16:92)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And worship your Rubb until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death).&#8221;</b></span><b> (15:99)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are Ahadith, one of them is narrated by `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">:</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) liked that act of worship most in the performance of which a person was regular and constant.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>153.</b> `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Should anyone fall asleep at night and fail to recite his portion of the Qur&#8217;an, or a part of it, if he recites it between the Fajr prayer and the Zuhr prayer, it will be recorded for him as though he had recited it during the night&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>154.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Abdullah! Do not be like so-and-so. He used to get up at night for optional prayer but abandoned it later.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>155.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) missed the optional night Salat (Tahajjud) due to pain or any other reason, he would perform twelve Rak`ah during the day time.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to    (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi&#8217; demonstrated    before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows    and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her.    She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother    (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his    mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your    mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my    prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk    to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don&#8217;t bring death to him unless he has seen    the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he    would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple    (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that    village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became    pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He    is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and    spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they    were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said:    Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and    said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and    when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we    have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before.    He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the    second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined    himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He    said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued    with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and    she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in    prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she    again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother    (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she    said: My Lord, don&#8217;t give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The    story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani    Isra&#8217;il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people):    If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to    her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and    he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth    to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and    demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You    have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from    your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just    leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he    came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He    is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking    blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just    rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was    sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His    mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to    see towards him, and said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him. He then returned to the chest    and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am    seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his    sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further    reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him    a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have    committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector,    and his mother said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,    and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between    them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said:    O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him, and they    passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you    committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her, and you said: O Allah,    make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t    make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in    fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she    had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.</font></p>

In the meanwhile, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came there and said:    What is this, the proclamation of the days of jahiliya (ignorance)? They said: Allah&#8217;s    Messenger, there is nothing serious. The two young men fell into dispute and the one    struck at the back of the other. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Well, a person    should help his brother whether he is an oppressor or an oppressed. If he is the oppressor    he should prevent him from doing it, for that is his help; and if he is the oppressed he    should be helped (against oppression).</font></p>

The first thing    which went into his stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).    He then rubbed his palate with dates and then invoked blessings for him and blessed him.    He was the first child who was born in Islam (after Migration).</font></p>

<h3 align="center">Good Manners and Form (Al-Adab)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.073.001"></a>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Walid bin &#8216;Aizar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Abi Amr &#8216;Ash-Shaibani saying, &#8220;The owner of this house.&#8221; he pointed to &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s house, &#8220;said, &#8216;I asked the Prophet &#8216;Which deed is loved most by Allah?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;To offer prayers at their early (very first) stated times.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To be good and dutiful to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, To participate in Jihad for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The Prophet narrated to me these three things, and if I had asked more, he would have told me more.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked for the fourth time, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father. &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet, &#8220;Shall I participate in Jihad?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are your parents living?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; the Prophet said, &#8220;Do Jihad for their benefit.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.&#8221; It was asked (by the people), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How does a man curse his parents?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;The man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While three persons were traveling, they were overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain. A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it. They said to each other. &#8216;Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from your difficulty. one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked (the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn&#8217;t return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky.&#8217; So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the second person said, &#8216;O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with her), she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said &#8216;O Allah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s slave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.&#8217; I said (to him). &#8216;Go and take those cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.&#8217; And so Allah released them (from their difficulty).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden you ( 1 ) to be undutiful to your mothers (2) to withhold (what you should give) or (3) demand (what you do not deserve), and (4) to bury your daughters alive. And Allah has disliked that (A) you talk too much about others ( B), ask too many questions (in religion), or (C) waste your property.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said thrice, &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the great sins?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221; He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah: to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet sat up after he had been reclining and added, &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false witness; I warn you against giving a forged statement and a false witness.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying that warning till we thought that he would not stop.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the greatest sins or he was asked about the greatest sins. He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to kill a soul which Allah has forbidden to kill; and to be undutiful or unkind to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Shall I inform you of the biggest of the great sins? That is the forged statement or the false witness.&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba (the sub-narrator) states that most probably the Prophet said, &#8220;the false witness.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother came to me, hoping (for my favor) during the lifetime of the Prophet asked the Prophet, &#8220;May I treat her kindly?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Uyaina said, &#8220;Then Allah revealed: &#8216;Allah forbids you not with regards to those who fought not against you because of religion, and drove you not out from your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them.&#8217;&#8230;&#8230;.(60.8)</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sufyan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Heraclius sent for him and said, &#8220;What did he, i.e. the Prophet order you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He orders us to offer prayers; to give alms; to be chaste; and to keep good relations with our relatives.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father, seeing a silken cloak being sold, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is worn only by that person who will have no share in the Hereafter.&#8221; Later a few silken cloaks were given to the Prophet as a gift, and he sent one of those cloaks to &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet), &#8220;How can I wear it while you have said about it what you said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar sent it to his (pagan) brother who was from the inhabitants of Mecca before he (&#8216;Umar&#8217;s brother) embraced Islam.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 12:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Inform me of a deed which will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He has something to ask (what he needs greatly).&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and join none in worship with Him: You should offer prayers perfectly, give obligatory charity (Zakat), and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Leave it!&#8221; (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;It seems that the Prophet was riding his she camel.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8216;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever loves that he be granted more wealth and that his lease of life be prolonged then he should keep good relations with his Kith and kin.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created the creations, and when He finished from His creations, Ar-Rahm i.e., womb said, &#8220;(O Allah) at this place I seek refuge with You from all those who sever me (i.e. sever the ties of Kith and kin). Allah said, &#8216;Yes, won&#8217;t you be pleased that I will keep good relations with the one who will keep good relations with you, and I will sever the relation with the one who will sever the relations with you.&#8217; It said, &#8216;Yes, O my Lord.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Then that is for you &#8216; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added. &#8220;Read (in the Qur&#8217;an) if you wish, the Statement of Allah: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship?&#8217; (47.22)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The word &#8216;Ar-Rahm (womb) derives its name from Ar-Rahman (i.e., one of the names of Allah) and Allah said: &#8216;I will keep good relation with the one who will keep good relation with you, (womb i.e. Kith and Kin) and sever the relation with him who will sever the relation with you, (womb, i.e. Kith and Kin).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet said, &#8220;The word &#8216;Ar-Rahm&#8217; (womb) derives its name from &#8216;Ar-Rahman&#8217; (i.e. Allah). So whosoever keeps good relations with it (womb i.e. Kith and kin), Allah will keep good relations with him, and whosoever will sever it (i.e. severs his bonds of Kith and kin) Allah too will sever His relations with him.</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Al-Wasil is not the one who recompenses the good done to him by his relatives, but Al-Wasil is the one who keeps good relations with those relatives who had severed the bond of kinship with him.&#8221;</p>

My father admonished me. But Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to my father), &#8220;Leave her,&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (then addressing me) said, &#8220;May you live so long that your dress gets worn out, and you will mend it many times, and then wear another till it gets worn out (i.e. May Allah prolong your life).&#8221; (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah aid, &#8220;That garment (which she was wearing remained usable for a long</p>

Then the Prophet came in and I informed him about this story.

<p style="text-align:justify;">(who was one of the companions who gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet underneath the tree (Al-Hudaibiya)) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever swears by a religion other than Islam (i.e. if somebody swears by saying that he is a non-Muslim e.g., a Jew or a Christian, etc.) in case he is telling a lie, he is really so if his oath is false, and a person is not bound to fulfill a vow about a thing which he does not possess. And if somebody commits suicide with anything in this world, he will be tortured with that very thing on the Day of Resurrection; And if somebody curses a believer, then his sin will be as if he murdered him; And whoever accuses a believer of Kufr (disbelief), then it is as if he killed him.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;I came out to inform you about the Night of Al-Qadr, but as so-and-so and so-and-so quarrelled, so the news about it had been taken away; and may be it was better for you. So look for it in the ninth, the seventh, or the fifth (of the last ten days of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Abu Dhar wearing a Burd (garment) and his slave too was wearing a Burd, so I said (to Abu Dhar), &#8220;If you take this (Burda of your slave) and wear it (along with yours), you will have a nice suit (costume) and you may give him another garment.&#8221; Abu Dhar said, &#8220;There was a quarrel between me and another man whose mother was a non-Arab and I called her bad names. The man mentioned (complained about) me to the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;Did you abuse so-and-so?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; He said, &#8220;Did you call his mother bad names?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He said, &#8220;You still have the traits of (the Pre-lslamic period of) ignorance.&#8221; I said. &#8220;(Do I still have ignorance) even now in my old age?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, they (slaves or servants) are your brothers, and Allah has put them under your command. So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.&#8221;</p>

Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were also present among the people on that day but dared not talk to him (about his unfinished prayer). And the hasty people went away, wondering. &#8220;Has the prayer been shortened&#8221; Among the people there was a man whom the Prophet used to call Dhul-Yadain (the longarmed). He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has it been shortened.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Surely, you have forgotten, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, Dhul-Yadain has told the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet got up and offered other two Rakat and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then he said Takbir, performed a prostration of ordinary duration or longer, then he raised his head and said Takbir and performed another prostration of ordinary duration or longer and then raised his head and said Takbir (i.e. he performed the two prostrations of Sahu, i.e., forgetfulness).&#8221;</p>

Shall we come in?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Come in.&#8221; They said, &#8220;All of us?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, come in all of you,&#8221; not knowing that Ibn Az-Zubair was also with them. So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of &#8216;Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur Rahman also started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said (to her), &#8220;The Prophet forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days).&#8221; So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others&#8217; sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, &#8220;I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one.&#8221; They (Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.</p>

I was Rifa&#8217;a&#8217;s wife and he divorced me thrice, and then I was married to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin AzZubair, who, by Allah has nothing with him except something like this fringe, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle,&#8221; showing a fringe she had taken from her covering sheet. Abu Bakr was sitting with the Prophet while Khalid Ibn Said bin Al-As was sitting at the gate of the room waiting for admission. Khalid started calling Abu Bakr, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Why don&#8217;t you reprove this lady from what she is openly saying before Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle did nothing except smiling, and then said (to the lady), &#8220;Perhaps you want to go back to Rifa&#8217;a? No, (it is not possible), unless and until you enjoy the sexual relation with him (&#8216;Abdur Rahman), and he enjoys the sexual relation with you.&#8221;</p>

Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you !&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I am astonished at these women who were with me. As soon as they heard your voice, they hastened to screen themselves.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You have more right, that they should be afraid of you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And then he (&#8216;Umar) turned towards them and said, &#8220;O enemies of your souls! You are afraid of me and not of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The women replied, &#8220;Yes, for you are sterner and harsher than Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Ibn Al-Khattab!

<p style="text-align:justify;">that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent him and Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal to Yemen, he said to them, &#8220;Facilitate things for the people (treat the people in the most agreeable way), and do not make things difficult for them, and give them glad tidings, and let them not have aversion (i.e. to make the people hate good deeds) and you should both work in cooperation and mutual understanding, obey each other.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are in a land in which a drink named Al Bit&#8217; is prepared from honey, and another drink named Al-Mizr is prepared from barley.&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;All intoxicants (i.e. all alcoholic drinks) are prohibited.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle was given the choice of one of two matters he would choose the easier of the two as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful, he would not approach it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle never took revenge over anybody for his own sake but (he did) only when Allah&#8217;s legal bindings were outraged, in which case he would take revenge for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 760. Vol. 4)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the city of Al-Ahwaz on the bank of a river which had dried up. Then Abu Barza Al-Aslami came riding a horse and he started praying and let his horse loose. The horse ran away, so Abu Barza interrupted his prayer and went after the horse till he caught it and brought it, and then he offered his prayer. There was a man amongst us who was (from the Khawari) having a different opinion. He came saying. &#8220;Look at this old man! He left his prayer because of a horse.&#8221; On that Abu Barza came to us and said, &#8220;Since the time I left Allah&#8217;s Apostle, nobody has admonished me; My house is very far from this place, and if I had carried on praying and left my horse, I could not have reached my house till night.&#8221; Then Abu Barza mentioned that he had been in the company of the Prophet, and that he had seen his leniency.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">But when he entered, the Prophet spoke to him gently in a polite manner. I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You have said what you have said, then you spoke to him in a very gentle and polite manner? The Prophet said, &#8220;The worse people, in the sight of Allah are those whom the people leave (undisturbed) to save themselves from their dirty language.&#8221;</p>

I hope that you will have a long life, and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed, is multiplied ten times, that means, as if you fasted the whole year.&#8221; I insisted (on fasting more) so I was given a hard instruction. I said, &#8220;I can do more than that (fasting)&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fast three days every week.&#8221; But as I insisted (on fasting more) so I was burdened. I said, &#8220;I can fast more than that.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fast as Allah&#8217;s prophet David used to fast.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How was the fasting of the prophet David?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;One half of a year (i.e. he used to fast on alternate days). &#8216;</p>

When it was night, Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; got up (for the night prayer). Salman said (to him), &#8220;Sleep,&#8221; and he slept.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr invited a group of people and told me, &#8220;Look after your guests.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, I am going to visit the Prophet and you should finish serving them before I return.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, So I went at once and served them with what was available at that time in the house and requested them to eat.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Where is the owner of the house (i.e., Abu Bakr)?&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Take your meal.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not eat till the owner of the house comes.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Accept your meal from us, for if my father comes and finds you not having taken your meal yet, we will be blamed severely by him, but they refused to take their meals . So I was sure that my father would be angry with me. When he came, I went away (to hide myself) from him. He asked, &#8220;What have you done (about the guests)?&#8221; They informed him the whole story. Abu Bakr called, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur Rahman!&#8221; I kept quiet. He then called again. &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!&#8221; I kept quiet and he called again, &#8220;O ignorant (boy)! I beseech you by Allah, if you hear my voice, then come out!&#8221; I came out and said, &#8220;Please ask your guests (and do not be angry with me).&#8221; They said, &#8220;He has told the truth; he brought the meal to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As you have been waiting for me, by Allah, I will not eat of it tonight.&#8221; They said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not eat of it till you eat of it.&#8221; He said, I have never seen a night like this night in evil. What is wrong with you? Why don&#8217;t you accept your meals of hospitality from us?&#8221; (He said to me), &#8220;Bring your meal.&#8221; I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, &#8220;In the name of Allah. The first (state of fury) was because of Satan.&#8221; So Abu Bakr ate and so did his guests.</p>

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;All that happened was from Satan.&#8221; So he asked for the meals and ate of it, and so did they. Whenever they took a handful of the meal, the meal grew (increased) from underneath more than that mouthful. He said (to his wife), &#8220;O, sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8221; She said, &#8220;O, pleasure of my eyes! The meal is now more than it had been before we started eating&#8221; So they ate of it and sent the rest of that meal to the Prophet. It is said that the Prophet also ate of it.</p>

Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, Huwaiyisa and Muhaiyisa, the two sons of Mas&#8217;ud, came to the Prophet and spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman who was the youngest of them all, started talking. The Prophet said, &#8220;Let the older (among you) speak first.&#8221; So they spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. The Prophet said, &#8220;Will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man,&#8221; (or said, &#8220;..your companion&#8221;). They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The murder was a thing we did not witness.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the Jews will release you from the oath, if fifty of them (the Jews) should take an oath to contradict your claim.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! They are disbelievers (and they will take a false oath).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself paid the blood money to them.</p>

When nobody spoke, the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree&#8221; When I came out with my father, I said, &#8220;O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What prevented you from saying it?&#8221; Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune).&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor Abu Bakr spoke, so I disliked to speak (in your presence).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 169:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar and we travelled during the night. A man amongst the people said to &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa&#8217;, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, and so he got down and started (chanting Huda) reciting for the people, poetry that keep pace with the camel&#8217;s foot steps, saying, &#8220;O Allah! Without You we would not have been guided on the right path, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed. Let all of us be sacrificed for Your cause and when we meet our enemy, make our feet firm and bestow peace and calmness on us and if they (our enemy) will call us towards an unjust thing we will refuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The infidels have made a hue and cry to ask others help against us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is that driver (of the camels)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa.&#8221;&#8216; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His mercy on him.&#8221; A man among the people said, Has Martyrdom been granted to him, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; We reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were stricken with severe hunger but Allah helped the Muslims conquer Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are those fires? For what are you making fires?&#8221; They said, &#8220;For cooking meat.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Donkeys&#8217; meat.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the cooking pots.&#8221; A man said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You can do that too.&#8221; When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit &#8216;Amir&#8217;s knee and caused him to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw me pale and said, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds of Amir have been annulled.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Who said so?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari said, &#8216;Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, &#8216;Amir will have double reward.&#8221;&#8216; (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers together to indicate that, and added, &#8220;He was really a hard-working man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Allah&#8217;s Cause) and rarely have there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an &#8220;Arab like him.&#8221;</p>

He gave us guidance and light while we were blind and astray, so our hearts are sure that whatever he says, will certainly happen.

While Abu Usaid was sitting there, the Prophet was busy with something in his hands so Abu Usaid told someone to take his son from the thigh of the Prophet . When the Prophet finished his job (with which he was busy), he said, &#8220;Where is the boy?&#8221; Abu Usaid replied, &#8220;We have sent him home.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is his name?&#8221; Abu Usaid said, &#8220;(His name is) so-and-so. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, his name is Al-Mundhir.&#8221; So he called him Al-Mundhir from that day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Name yourselves after me (by my name), but do not call yourselves by my Kuniya, and whoever sees me in a dream, he surely sees me, for Satan cannot impersonate me (appear in my figure).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once Um Sulaim was (with the women who were) in charge of the luggage on a journey, and Anjashah, the slave of the Prophet, was driving their camels (very fast).

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was the best of all the people in character. I had a brother called Abu &#8216;Umar, who, I think, had been newly weaned. Whenever he (that child) was brought to the Prophet the Prophet used to say, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Umar! What did Al-Nughair (nightingale) (do)?&#8221; It was a nightingale with which he used to play. Sometimes the time of the Prayer became due while he (the Prophet) was in our house. He would order that the carpet underneath him be swept and sprayed with water, and then he would stand up (for the prayer) and we would line up behind him, and he would lead us in prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most beloved names to &#8216;Ali was Abu Turab, and he used to be pleased when we called him by it, for none named him Abu Turab (for the first time), but the Prophet. Once &#8216;Ali got angry with (his wife) Fatima, and went out (of his house) and slept near a wall in the mosque. The Prophet came searching for him, and someone said, &#8220;He is there, Lying near the wall.&#8221; The Prophet came to him while his (&#8216;Ali&#8217;s) back was covered with dust. The Prophet started removing the dust from his back, saying, &#8220;Get up, O Abu Turab!&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d! Didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habab said?&#8221; (meaning &#8216;Abdullah bin Unbar). &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: &#8216;You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you&#8230;..and from the pagans (3.186)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8216;Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. &#8230;. (2.109) So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah&#8217;s Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)&#8221;. Then they became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Did you benefit Abu Talib with anything as he used to protect and take care of you, and used to become angry for you?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, he is in a shallow place of Fire. But for me he would have been in the lowest part of the Fire.&#8221;</p>

Sometimes they tell something which comes out to be true.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;That word which comes to be true is what a jinx snatches away by stealing and then pours it in the ear of his fore-teller with a sound similar to the cackle of a hen, and then they add to it one-hundred lies.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying. &#8220;Then there was a pause in the revelation of the Divine Inspiration to me.

So I opened the gate for him and gave him the glad tidings of entering Paradise. Then another man came and asked permission to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was sitting in a leaning posture, so he sat up and said, &#8220;Open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him or which will take place.&#8221; I went, and behold !

Who will go and wake the sleeping lady-occupants up of these dwellings (for praying)?&#8221; (He meant by this his wives.) The Prophet added, &#8220;A well-dressed soul (person) in this world may be naked in the &#8220;Hereafter.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I asked the Prophet, &#8216;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

The Prophet got up to accompany her, and when they reached the gate of the mosque opposite the dwelling place of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by, and greeting Allah&#8217;s Apostle , they quickly went ahead.

O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (how dare we suspect you).&#8221; That was a great thing for both of them. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Satan runs in the body of Adam&#8217;s son (i.e. man) as his blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that he (Satan) might insert an evil thought in your hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah likes sneezing and dislikes yawning, so if someone sneezes and then praises Allah, then it is obligatory on every Muslim who heard him, to say: May Allah be merciful to you (Yar-hamuka-l-lah). But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so one must try one&#8217;s best to stop it, if one says &#8216;Ha&#8217; when yawning, Satan will laugh at him.&#8221;</p>

When the latter says &#8216;Yar-hamuka-llah&#8221;, the former should say, &#8216;Yahdikumul-lah wa Yuslih balakum&#8217; (May Allah give you guidance and improve your condition).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah loves sneezing but dislikes yawning; so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises Allah, every Muslim who hears him (praising Allah) has to say Tashmit to him. But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so if one of you yawns, he should try his best to stop it, for when anyone of you yawns, Satan laughs at him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam in his complete  shape and form (directly), sixty cubits (about 30 meters) in height. When He created him,  He said (to him), &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what  they will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your  offspring.&#8221; Adam (went and) said, &#8216;As-Salamu alaikum (Peace be upon you).&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;AsSalamu-&#8216;Alaika wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you) So they  increased &#8216;Wa Rahmatullah&#8217; The Prophet added &#8216;So whoever will enter Paradise, will be of  the shape and form of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam&#8217;s (offspring) (i.e. stature of  human beings is being diminished continuously) to the present time.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Fadl bin &#8216;Abbas rode behind the Prophet as his companion  rider on the back portion of his she camel on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifice,  10th Dhul-Hijja) and Al-Fadl was a handsome man. The Prophet stopped to give the people  verdicts. In the meantime, a beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came, asking the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty attracted him.  The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at her; so the Prophet held out his  hand backwards and caught the chin of Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in  order that he should not gaze at her. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of  Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due (compulsory) on my  father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be  sufficient that I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;Beware! Avoid sitting on the  roads.&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! We can&#8217;t help sitting (on  the roads) as these are (our places) here we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216; l f you  refuse but to sit, then pay the road its right &#8216; They said, &#8220;What is the right of the  road, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8216;Lowering your gaze, refraining from harming  others, returning greeting, and enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is evil.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say: As-Salam be  on Allah from His worshipers, As-Salam be on Gabriel, As-Salam be on Michael, As-Salam be  on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Allah  Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one sits in the prayer, one should say,  &#8216;At-Tahiyatu-lillahi Was-Salawatu, Wat-Taiyibatu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyyu wa  Rah-matul-lahi wa Barakatuhu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaina wa &#8216;ala &#8216;Ibadillahi assalihin, for if he  says so, then it will be for all the pious slave of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth.  (Then he should say), &#8216;Ash-hadu an la ilaha illalllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;Abduhu  wa rasulu-hu,&#8217; and then he can choose whatever speech (i.e. invocation) he wishes &#8221;  (See Hadith No. 797, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he was a boy of ten at the time when the Prophet  emigrated to Medina. He added: I served Allah&#8217;s Apostle for ten years (the last part of  his life time) and I know more than the people about the occasion whereupon the order of  Al-Hijab was revealed (to the Prophet). Ubai b n Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. It was  revealed (for the first time) during the marriage of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with Zainab bint  Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who  took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they  prolonged their stay. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with  him till he came to the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle thought that  those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he  entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The  Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he  returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone. At that time the Divine  Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed, and the Prophet set a screen between me and him (his  family). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 74, Number 256: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet married Zainab, the people came and were  offered a meal, and then they sat down (after finishing their meals) and started chatting.  The Prophet showed as if he wanted to get up, but they did not get up. When he noticed  that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and went away, while some others kept  on sitting. When the Prophet returned to enter, he found the people still sitting, but  then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet of their departure and he came and went  in. I intended to go in but the Prophet put a screen between me and him, for Allah  revealed:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses..&#8217; (33.53) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Let your wives be veiled&#8221; But he did not do so. The wives of  the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.&#8217; Once  Sauda, the daughter of Zam&#8217;a went out and she was a tall woman. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw  her while he was in a gathering, and said, &#8220;I have recognized you, O Sauda!&#8221; He  (&#8216;Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling  of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover  excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man peeped through a round hole into the dwelling place  of the Prophet, while the Prophet had a Midray (an iron comb) with which he was scratching  his head. the Prophet said, &#8221; Had known you were looking (through the hole), I would  have pierced your eye with it (i.e., the comb).&#8221; Verily! The order of taking  permission to enter has been enjoined because of that sight, (that one should not look  unlawfully at the state of others). (See Hadith No. 807, Vol. 7) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have not seen a thing resembling &#8216;lamam&#8217; (minor sins)  than what Abu Huraira &#8216;narrated from the Prophet who said &#8220;Allah has written for  Adam&#8217;s son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is  the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing), the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the  inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Musa replied,  &#8220;I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the  permission is not given, then he should return.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah! We  will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it.&#8221; (Abu Musa went to a gathering of the  Ansar and said). &#8220;Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet ?&#8221; Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  said, &#8220;By Allah, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a  witness).&#8221; (Abu Said) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed  &#8216;Umar that the Prophet had said so.

She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots and put it  in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the  Jumua (Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present  us with that meal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a  midday nap, nor meals, except after the Friday prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 60, Vol.2) </font></p>

Usama bin  Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (who was  sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened  before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims  and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, and  there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that  gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Don&#8217;t cover us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,  dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the  Holy Quran. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai&#8217; bin Salul said, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than  what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go  back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to  him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;(O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!) Come to us and  bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims,  the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with  one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then  rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada, he said, &#8220;O  Sa&#8217;d, didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai). He said  so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him,  for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided  to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with  the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the  way you saw him behaving.&#8221; So the Prophet excused him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik narrating (when he did not join the  battle of Tabuk): Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to speak to us. I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips to  return to my greetings or not till fifty nights passed away. The Prophet then announced  (to the people) Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for us (acceptance of our repentance) at the time when  he had offered the Fajr (morning) prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu  Marthad Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, &#8220;Proceed till you reach  Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin  Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca).&#8221; So we overtook her while she was proceeding on  her camel at the same place as Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us. We said (to her) &#8220;Where is  the letter which is with you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; So we  made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8220;We do not see any letter.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not tell a lie. By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out  the letter, I will strip you of your clothes&#8217; When she noticed that I was serious, she put  her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and  brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the letter. The Prophet  said (to Habib), &#8220;What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied,  &#8220;I have done nothing except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not  changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of  Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my property, as there is none among  your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against  harm). The Prophet said, &#8220;Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him  (anything) but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Verily he has betrayed Allah,  His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah looked upon the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do  whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar  wept and said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e.,  under the command of another ruler). By Allah, I think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from  his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of &#8216;Abdul  Muttalib. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If  the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will  request him to recommend us to him. &#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah! If we ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us.  Besides, I will never ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; (See Hadith No 728, Vol 5) </font></p>

I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it,  not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except  that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole  amount) among Allah&#8217;s slaves like this and like this and like this.&#8221; The Prophet  pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, &#8220;O Abu Dhar!&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Labbaik wa Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Those who have  much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who  do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).&#8221; Then he ordered me,  &#8220;Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.&#8221; He  went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something  might have happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I  remembered the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept  on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but  then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, &#8220;That was  Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without  joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was no name dearer to &#8216;Ali than his nickname Abu  Turab (the father of dust). He used to feel happy whenever he was called by this name.  Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to the house of Fatima but did not find &#8216;Ali in the house. So he  asked &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;There was something (a quarrel)  between me and him whereupon he got angry with me and went out without having a midday nap  in my house.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked a person to look for him. That person came, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He (Ali) is sleeping in the mosque.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went there and found him lying. His upper body cover had fallen off to one side of  his body, and so he was covered with dust. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started cleaning the dust from  him, saying, &#8220;Get up, O Abu Turab! Get up, Abu Turab!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 432, Vol  1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas said, &#8220;Um Sulaim used to spread a leather sheet  for the Prophet and he used to take a midday nap on that leather sheet at her home.&#8221;  Anas added, &#8220;When the Prophet had slept, she would take some of his sweat and hair  and collect it (the sweat) in a bottle and then mix it with Suk (a kind of perfume) while  he was still sleeping. &#8220;When the death of Anas bin Malik approached, he advised that  some of that Suk be mixed with his Hanut (perfume for embalming the dead body), and it was  mixed with his Hanut. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to Quba, he used to visit Um  Haram bint Milhan who would offer him meals; and she was the wife of &#8216;Ubada bin As-samit.  One day he went to her house and she offered him a meal, and after that he slept, and then  woke up smiling. She (Um Haram) said, &#8220;I asked him, &#8216;What makes you laugh, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Some people of my followers were displayed before me as warriors  fighting for Allah&#8217;s Cause and sailing over this sea, kings on thrones,&#8217; or said, &#8216;like  kings on thrones.&#8217; (The narrator, Ishaq is in doubt about it.) I (Um Haram) said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that He may make me one of them.&#8217; He invoked (Allah) for her  and then lay his head and slept again and then woke up smiling. I asked, &#8216;What makes you  laugh, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Some people of my followers were displayed before me  as warriors fighting for Allah&#8217;s Cause and sailing over this sea, kings on the thrones,&#8217;  or said, &#8216;like kings on the thrones.&#8217; I (Um Haram) said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah  that He may make me one of them.&#8217; He said, You will be amongst the first ones.&#8221; It is  said that Um Haram sailed over the sea at the time of Muawiya, and on coming out of the  sea, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He added, &#8216;But this year he reviewed it with me twice, and  therefore I think that my time of death has approached. So, be afraid of Allah, and be  patient, for I am the best predecessor for you (in the Hereafter).&#8217; &#8221; Fatima added,  &#8220;So I wept as you (&#8216;Aisha) witnessed. And when the Prophet saw me in this sorrowful  state, he confided the second secret to me saying, &#8216;O Fatima! Will you not be pleased that  you will be chief of all the believing women (or chief of the women of this nation i.e. my  followers?&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">28- On the authority of Hamzah bin Suhaib on the authority of his father who said that Umar said to Suhaib: You are a great man but would that you didn’t have three characteristics!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: And what are they?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: You have taken a kuniya (nickname) but you don&#8217;t have a son. You ascribe yourself to the Arabs but you are from Rome and you waste food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib replied: As for your saying: “You have taken a kuniya (nickname) but you don&#8217;t have a son”, rather the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – gave me a kuniya, Abu Yahya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying: that I ascribed my self to the Arabs and that I&#8217;m not from them but that I&#8217;m from Rome. Rather, I am a person from an-Nimar bin Qaasit and I was taken as a prisoner from Mousil to Rome while I was a child and knew my lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying: that I waste food. Rather, I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – saying: &#8216;The best of you are those who feed people.&#8217;<br />
No.44</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29- On the authority of Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amroo on the authority of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who said: &#8216;The pleasure of your Lord is in pleasing your father. And the anger of your Lord is in making your father angry.&#8217;<br />
No.516</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30- On the authority of Abu Huraira, on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who said: &#8216;Musa asked his Lord about six characteristics, which he thought were only and purely for him alone and he did not like the seventh one.<br />
1- He asked: &#8216;O my Lord! Which of your slaves are the most pious?<br />
He answered: He who/the one who remembers Allaah and does not forget.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- He asked: &#8216;Which of your slaves are the most guided?<br />
He answered: the one who follows the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- He asked: Which of your slaves is the best in judgement?<br />
He answered: the one who judges for the people just as he judges for his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- He asked: Which of your slaves is the most knowledgeable?<br />
He answered: The one who is not satisfied and always has a thirst for knowledge, he adds the knowledge of the people to his knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- He asked: which of your slaves are the most honourable?<br />
He answered: The one who has the capability to forgive, then forgives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- He asked: Which of your slaves is the most content?<br />
He answered: The one who is pleased with what he is given.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- He asked: Which of your slaves is the neediest?<br />
He answered: The one who utilizes what he has and always requires more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: Satisfaction is not that which is apparent; indeed satisfaction is satisfaction of the self/soul. If Allaah intends good for His slave then He places satisfaction in his soul and his Taqwa (piety) in his heart. And if Allaah intends evil for a slave then He places poverty where ever he turns.&#8217;<br />
No. 3350</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31- On the authority of &#8216;Alee who said: when I held onto the weapon of Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – I found a slip of paper in the sheath of the sword (scabbard) of Allaah’s Messenger which had on it: &#8216;Keep good relations with the one who breaks away from you. Be good to the one who is bad to you and say the truth even if it is against yourself.&#8217;<br />
No. 1911</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32- On the authority of Anas who said: There was a man who was with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – the man&#8217;s son came, he kissed him and sat him on his lap. His daughter came and he just sat her next to him. The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: &#8216;If only you had been just between them!&#8217; No.3098</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">9- On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said: this is on my side of the land! And I said: It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah!

<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr &#8211; RadhiAllaahuanhu- went off to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabiah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>

One day he wanted to go out to the desert, so he sent me a female-camel which could not be tamed and rode from the camels which were for charity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen<br />
</span>Makaarim-ul-Akhlaaq (pg. 32-35)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This is a chapter from the book &#8220;<i>Makaarim-ul-Akhlaaq</i>&#8221; (pg. 32-35) [Dar-ul-Watan Lin-Nashr] By Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, prepared and arranged by Khaalid Abu Saalih.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned previously that good manners can either be present in someone naturally or they can be instilled into him (i.e. through learning). And we stated that inherent good manners are better than acquired good manners. We mentioned a proof for this which was the Messenger of Allaah’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement to Al-Ashaj bin ‘Abdil-Qais (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>): <b>“Rather, Allaah has molded (i.e. created) you upon these two (noble characteristics).”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also because good manners that are innate do not disappear from a human being whereas good manners that are acquired may vanish from a person in many instances since it requires constant practice and effort as well as exercise and hard work. It also requires that one be reminded of it whenever there occurs something that affects a human being. This is why when a man once came to the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah, advise me”, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Do not get angry.”</b> The man then repeated his request several times, upon which the Prophet continued to reply: <b>“Do not get angry.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said: <b>“The strong person is not the one who wrestles and overpowers his opponents. Rather the strong person is the one who controls himself in times of anger.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a strong person is not someone who wrestles with people and overpowers them, He is someone <b>“who controls himself in times of anger.”</b> He takes hold of himself and restrains himself during instances when he becomes angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person controlling himself in times of anger is considered a characteristic of good manners. So if you become angry, do not let your anger penetrate, rather seek refuge in Allaah from the accursed Devil. And if you are standing, then sit down. If you are sitting, then lie down. And if your anger increases, then perform ablution (<i>wudoo</i>) until it goes away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person may acquire and earn good manners by way of training (himself), working hard at it and through constant practice. So he may obtain good manners through one of the following methods:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> By contemplating on the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger: One should look up the texts that show the virtue of the particular noble characteristic that he wishes to characterize himself with. This is since when a believer sees some texts that praise a characteristic or action, he implements them. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) indicated this when he said: <b>“The example of a good companion and an evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and a blacksmith. The seller of musk either sells you (perfume), gives you free samples or you get a pleasing smell from him. As for the example of an evil companion – such as a blacksmith – he either burns your clothes or you get a nasty smell from him.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>He should accompany those who are known for having good manners whilst staying far away from those who possess bad manners and poor actions. This is such that he turns this companionship of his into an educational institute that assists him in (his goal of) obtaining good manners. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“A man is upon the religion of his close friend, so let each of you look into whom he takes as a close friend.” </b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: </b>He should reflect on the consequences that come as a result of having bad manners. This is since a person with bad manners is despised. A person with bad manners is forsaken. A person with bad manners is always talked about in a bad way. So when one comes to realize that bad manners will lead him to all of this, he will then keep away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourth: </b>He should always envision an image of the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) manners and how he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would humble himself before the creation, being kind to them, forgiving to them and patient with their harm. So if a person visualizes the Prophet’s character and the fact that he was the best of mankind and the greatest of those who worshipped Allaah, he will then perceive a low image of himself and at this point the influence that arrogance has over him will be shattered and this will cause him to have good manners.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Abu Dawood (no. 5335), Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad</i> (4/206), Muslim with only the first part of it (no. 25 &amp; 26), and At-Tirmidhee (no. 2011)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6116) and At-Tirmidhee (no. 2020)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6114) and Muslim (no. 107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Purification (of the soul) cannot be achieved except by way of the messengers as stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim when he said: “Purifying the souls is harder and more difficult than curing the bodies. So whoever purifies his soul through exercise, hard work and being in isolation – all of which the messengers did not come with – he is like a sick person that tries to cure himself based on his own opinion. Where is his opinion with respect to the expertise of a doctor?! The messengers are the doctors of the hearts – there is no way to purify and rectify the hearts except through their way, at their hands and by totally submitting and complying with them. And we ask Allaah for His assistance!” [Madaarij-us-Saalikeen (2/300)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2101 &amp; 5534) and Muslim (no. 146); An-Nawawee said: “This shows the virtue of accompanying righteous and good people – those who possess chivalry, good manners, piety, knowledge, and good behavior. It also shows the prohibition of accompanying evil people, innovators, and those who backbite people or who are very wicked and so on, i.e. other types of condemnable characteristics.” [See <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i>: (16/394)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by At-Tirmidhee (no. 2378) who said it was <i>hasan saheeh</i>, Abu Dawood (no. 4833), Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad </i>(2/303, 334) and deemed <i>hasan </i> (sound) by Al-Albaanee in <i>Saheeh-ul-Jaami’ as-Sagheer</i> (no. 3545) and <i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah</i> (no. 927).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture was given on Monday May 21, 2012.  This is part 4 in our lecture mini-series covering the book مكارم الأخلاق (Upright Moral Character) by our noble Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yesterday we discussed the first kind of good manners, good manners with Allah, the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Today we will read about the second kind of good manners, good manners in dealing with the creation (the people). Our noble Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen describes good manners with the people as including three things. </span></p>
<p>Listen to find out what they are, in shaa Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture was given on Sunday May 20, 2012.  This is part 3 in our lecture mini-series covering the book مكارم الأخلاق (<strong>Upright Moral Character</strong>) by our noble Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Many people believe that good manners are just in dealing with other people &#8211; being nice to others.  This is a deficient understanding.  Rather a person must have good manners with his Creator first!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So know that good character has two forms; Good manners with one&#8217;s Creator and good manners with the creation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The focus of today will be on having good manners with the Creator. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">So what 3 things are from good manners with our Creator?</span></p>
<p>Listen and find out&#8230;</p>

<p>This lecture was given on Saturday May 19, 2012.  This is part 2 in our lecture mini-series covering the book مكارم الأخلاق (Upright Moral Character) by our noble Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen.</p>
<p>Today we begin with the point by the Sheikh regarding the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Which is better, good character which is inborn and natural or the good character which is sought after and attained by effort on the part of the person?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And what are the categories of people regarding good manners?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we begin studying from the book <strong>مكارم الأخلاق Makarim al-Akhlaq (Upright Moral Character)</strong> by our noble Sheikh Muhammad bin Saaleh al-Uthaymeen, rahimahullah. This was originally a talk that the Sheikh gave to the youth in a summer camp regarding good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may find the original arabic text of the book on the Sheikh&#8217;s website at:<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a topic of great importance, so please take the time to listen and benefit, in shaa Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 01</strong>: We begin with a few stories from the life of our Sheikh, rahimahullah, and then with the introduction and the text of the book.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having good manners with the creation, then some of them have defined it as <span style="color:#993300;">withholding abuse</span>, <span style="color:#993300;">extending kindness</span> and <span style="color:#993300;">having a cheerful countenance</span>. This has been mentioned as a saying of Al-Hasan Al-Basree, may Allaah have mercy on him. [1]</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">First: The Meaning of Withholding Abuse</span>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by withholding abuse is that a person refrains from harming others whether <strong>financially, spiritually or socially</strong> (i.e. by harming his reputation). So whoever does not withhold from harming the creation, he does not possess good manners. On the contrary, he is ill-mannered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger proclaimed the prohibition of harming a Muslim through any means of <span style="color:#ff0000;">abuse</span>. He did this during the greatest of gatherings in which he congregated with his ummah, saying: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, your blood (i.e. lives), your wealth and your honor are sacred for you just like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this land of yours.<strong>&#8220;</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man transgresses against people by taking their wealth or by committing fraud or by deceiving them or by hitting them and committing a crime against them or by reviling, backbiting or slandering them, such a person is not good-mannered towards people. This is since he has not refrained from harming others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the sin of this becomes even greater every time his bad manners are directed towards someone who has a bigger right over you. So maltreatment of your parents, for example, is worse than you treating anyone else bad. Maltreatment of your relatives is worse than you treating strangers bad. And maltreatment of your neighbors is worse than treating those who are not your neighbors bad. This is why the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">By Allaah, he does not believe! By Allaah, he does not believe! By Allaah, he does not believe!&#8221;</span> They (i.e. the Companions) said: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Who O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; He said: &#8220;He whose neighbor is not safe from his calamities<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: The Meaning of Extending Kindness:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word nadaa (kindness) means <strong>generosity</strong> and <strong>courtesy</strong>, i.e. to extend one&#8217;s generosity and courtesy to others. Generosity does not mean what some people think it to be, which is giving money only. Rather, generosity can also be by way of giving one&#8217;s self, offering one&#8217;s status (to assist), donating one&#8217;s wealth and spreading one&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we see an individual <strong>taking care of the people&#8217;s needs</strong> by helping them, directing their affairs to those who are not able to reach them, spreading his knowledge amongst the people and donating his wealth to them, can we describe this man as having good manners? Yes, we can say he has good manners because he has extended kindness and generosity. This is why the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Fear Allaah wherever you may be, and follow up an evil deed with a good deed, (for) it will wipe it out. And treat the people with good manners<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls under treating the people with good manners is: If you are oppressed and maltreated by someone,<strong> you should pardon and forgive that person</strong>. Allaah has praised those who pardon others, as He says about the inhabitants of Paradise: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who spend (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) during times of prosperity and adversity, who repress anger and who pardon people. Verily, Allaah loves the good-doers<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 134]</p>
<p>And Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">And to forego is closer to piety (Taqwaa)<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 237]</p>
<p>And He says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let them pardon and forgive<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah An-Noor: 22]</p>
<p>And He says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allaah<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person is in constant contact with people, so he will most definitely encounter some bad treatment from people. But his stance with regard to this bad treatment should be that of <strong>pardoning and overlooking</strong>. And he should know for certain that by pardoning, overlooking, and responding with good, the animosity that exists between him and his brother will transform to amicability, love and friendship. Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">The good deed and the evil deed are not equal. Repel (the evil) with that which is better, then behold, the one between whom he and you there was enmity (will become) as though he were a close friend<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Fussilat: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those of you who have knowledge of the Arabic language should reflect on how the end-result is derived here via the abrupt mention of &#8220;<strong>idhaa</strong>&#8221; (which means &#8220;then behold&#8221; here). The abrupt mention of this word indicates that the result (at the end of the ayah) will come to pass immediately, and that is: &#8220;then behold, the one between whom he and you there was enmity (will become) as though he were a close friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, not everyone is granted this same result. This is why Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">But none are granted it except those who are patient. And none are granted it except those who possess a great portion (of moral character)<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Fussilat: 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do we understand from this that pardoning a criminal is praiseworthy in the absolute sense and that it is something that we were ordered to do? Some people have come up with this understanding based on this verse. However, it should be known that <strong>pardoning should only be commended if forgiving is the best and most advisable option</strong>. However, if retribution is the best option then doing that is better. This is why Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">The recompense for an evil is an evil the like thereof. But whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allaah. Verily, He likes not the wrongdoers<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 40] So here Allaah has linked forgiveness with reconciliation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is possible that forgiveness may not necessarily mean reconciliation. For example, it could be that this individual who committed a crime against you and was insolent towards you is an evil man who is known for being evil and corrupt, and so if you were to forgive him, he would persist in his evil and mischief. In this situation, it is better that this man is punished for his crime since there is reconciliation in this.Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;Reconciliation is obligatory whereas forgiveness is optional. So in the event that forgiveness will cause reconciliation to be bypassed, this means that we have given precedence to something optional over something obligatory. And the religious legislation did not come to institute this.&#8221; And he has spoken truthfully, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Important Note</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to take this opportunity to point out something that many people do today with the intention of being good and sympathetic. And it is that when a person gets into an accident and as a result another person dies, the guardians of the deceased come and revoke the blood-money that is owed by this offender that committed the accident. So is their canceling of the blood-money praiseworthy and considered as being from good manners or does this issue have more detail to it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is more detail required on this issue. We must reflect and ponder on the condition of this offender who has caused this accident. Is he from among those people who are known to be careless and inconsiderate? Does he fall into the type of people that say: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I run over somebody on the road because I already have his blood-money prepared inside my desk&#8221; and we seek refuge in Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or is he someone who has fallen into an accident even though he employed complete discretion and complete poise and balance, but in spite of this Allaah had already decreed all things to come to pass?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he falls under the second category of people, then forgiving him is better. However, even if he does fall under this second category of prudent and well-poised people, before we forgive him, we must look to see if the victim has any debt he owes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the victim owes a debt, we cannot forgive the offender. And had we already pardoned the offender, the pardon would be dismissed. This is an issue that perhaps many people are unaware of. We say this because the heirs will assume entitlement of this blood-money from the victim that was killed in an accident, and their entitlement will not be satisfied until they pay back the deceased&#8217;s debt if he owed someone money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why when Allaah mentions inheritance, He says: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">(The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or a debt (he owes).<strong>&#8220;</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that forgiving people is part of good manners and it falls under the realm of extending kindness to others. This is since extending kindness can either be in the form of giving something or in the form of revoking something, and pardoning falls under revoking something.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Third: A Cheerful Countenance</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Having a cheerful countenance means that your face is radiant and illuminated when you come in contact with other human beings. The opposite of this is to appear with a gloomy face. This is why the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not think little of any good deed, even if it is encountering your brother with a cheerful face<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p>A poet put this understanding into a verse, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;My son, indeed piety can be something so trivial,<br />
as a cheerful face and a soft-spoken tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a cheerful face allows happiness to enter into people; it brings out love and amiability; and it causes the heart to expand &#8211; both yours and those you encounter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if you always appear upset, people will run away from you. They will not be happy sitting with you or talking to you. Perhaps you may even be afflicted with psychological problems. You may be suffering from a dangerous disease known as stress. If so, then being happy and having a cheerful face is from the most effective treatments one can use to combat this disease. This is why doctors advise those who are afflicted with this illness to keep away from those things that cause them to be instigated and angered since that will only cause their sickness to grow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being happy and having a cheerful face causes this disease to be exterminated. And as a result of these two characteristics, a person will become loved by the people and dear to them.</p>
<p>These are the <strong>three foundations that good manners</strong> when dealing with the creation revolve around.</p>
<p>Also from the <strong><span style="color:#993300;">signs of good manners towards creation</span></strong> is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That a person observes good relations with those friends and relatives that he is contact with. He should not be bothered by them nor should he inconvenience them. On the contrary, he should cause happiness to go into their hearts according to the extent that he is able to, within the confines of Allaah&#8217;s Legislation. This restriction is absolutely necessary since there are some people who cannot be made happy except with things that are disobedience to Allaah, and we seek refuge in Allaah! So we should not consent with him in this. However, causing happiness and joy to enter into those you keep ties with whether they are your family members, friends or relatives according to the limits of the Religion is part of having good manners. This is why the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of you are those who are the best towards their family. And I am the best of you towards my family.</span><strong>&#8220;</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Many people, unfortunately, display good manners in front of people yet they do not behave in the same manner towards their family</span>. This is extremely wrong and the opposite of how things should be. How can you have good manners in front of strangers yet bad manners in front of your own family?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone may say: Because I take care of them and support them! We respond by saying: This is not something that should cause you to display bad manners towards them. Your family members and relatives have the most right out of all people that you should be good-mannered towards them when accompanying and spending time with them. This is why when a man once asked the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, who has the most right amongst people of my good companionship&#8221; , he (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) replied: <strong>&#8220;Your mother.&#8221;</strong> The man said: &#8220;Then who?&#8221; He replied: <strong>&#8220;Your mother.&#8221;</strong> The man said: &#8220;Then who?&#8221; He replied: <strong>&#8220;Your mother.&#8221;</strong> The man said: &#8220;Then who?&#8221; He replied: <strong>&#8220;Your father.&#8221;</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, some people behave contrary to this. So you will find him having a bad relationship with his mother while having a good relationship with his wife. So he gives having good ties with his wife precedence (over having good ties with his mother) whereas the status of his wife before him is like that of a captive. The Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Take care of the women for indeed they are like captives before you</span><strong>.&#8221;</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: Keeping good relations with family, friends and relatives is all part of having good manners.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] See al-Adaab-ush- Shar&#8217;eeyah (2/216); There are also other definitions for good manners such as the definition of Al-Waasitee, where he said: &#8220;It is when one does not argue due to his complete awareness of Allaah. It is also said it means the relinquishment of immoral characteristics and the adornment of virtuous characteristics. It is also said that it means offering the good while withholding the vile. Sahl was once asked about it so he replied: &#8216;The lowest form of it is showing, tolerance, lack of retribution and mercy towards the wrongdoer, while asking Allaah to forgive him and showing sympathy towards him.'&#8221; [Refer to Madaarij-us- Saalikeen of Ibn Al-Qayyim (2/294), Ihyaa &#8216;Uloom-id-Deen of Abu Haamid Al-Ghazaalee (3/53) and al-Adaab-ush- Shar&#8217;eeyah (2/216)]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee</strong> [Al-Asaalah, Issue #20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Whoever loves that the people appear before him standing (up for him), then let him find his seat in the Hellfire.</span></span>&#8221; Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in Al-Adab-ul-Mufrad (977) and others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It occurs from the path of Habeeb Ibn Ash-Shaheed on the authority of Abu Mujliz, who said: &#8220;Mu&#8217;awiyah entered a house in which was &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Az-Zubair and &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Aamir. So Ibn &#8216;Aamir stood up while Ibn Az-Zubair remained seated – and he was the one with the most experience of the two. So Mu&#8217;awiyah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, said: &#8220;Sit O Ibn &#8216;Aamir for I heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, say: [and he mentioned the hadeeth]. At-Tirmidhee said: &#8220;It is a hasan hadeeth.&#8221; I say: Rather, it is a saheeh hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mukhlis said in (his book) Al-Fawaa&#8217;id:<br />
&#8216;Abdullaah narrated to us: Dawood reported to us: Marwaan reported to us, Mugheerah Ibn Muslim As-Siraaj reported on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Buraidah that he said: &#8220;Mu&#8217;awiyah went outside (one day) and saw that they were standing up because he was going out. So he said to them: Sit for the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8216;Whoever is pleased that the Children of Adam (mankind) stand up for him, Hellfire becomes binding upon him.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration.<br />
Shabaaba Ibn Siwaar followed up the same hadeeth except that he reported &#8220;Whoever loves that men gather around him standing (up for him)…&#8221; and the rest is the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by At-Tahaawee (2/38/39) and Al-Khateeb in Taareekh Baghdaad (13/193). And the hadeeth has another supporting evidence with Al-Khateeb (11/361) in mursal form concerning a road story. He reported it from &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq Ibn Sulaimaan Ibn &#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad who said: I heard my father say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Once Al-Ma&#8217;moon (the Khaleefah at that time) went to visit the jewelers in the market place. So he haggled with them on the price of an object that they had. Then Al-Ma&#8217;moon embarked on completing some of his needs. Then he left, so everyone that was in that gathering stood up for him except for Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad, for he did not stand. So Al-Ma&#8217;moon looked at him with an expression of anger. Then he took him to the side and said: &#8216;O Shaikh, what prevented you from standing up for me as your companions stand up for me?&#8217; So he (&#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad) said: &#8216;I honor the Ameer Al-Mu&#8217;mineen too much (to stand up for him) because of the hadeeth that we report from the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.&#8217; He said: &#8216;What is it?&#8217; &#8220;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad said: &#8216;I heard Al-Mubaraak Ibn Fudaalah say: I heard Al-Hasan say: the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said…[then he mentioned the hadeeth with the first wording]. So Al-Ma&#8217;moon lowered his head pondering over the hadeeth. Then he raised his head and said: &#8216;No one should buy except from this Shaikh.&#8217; So the people bought only from that Shaikh on that day till he had the amount of thirty thousand deenaars.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s saying:<br />
&#8220;And whoever fears Allaah, he will make a way out for him (i.e. from difficulty), and he will provide for him from places he never imagined&#8221; became a reality for &#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad, the reliable and trustworthy reporter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Dainooree reported a similar story to this in Al-Muntaqaa min Al-Majaalisah: Ahmad Ibn &#8216;Alee Al-Basree narrated to us saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al-Mutawakkil (the Khaleefah at that time) turned his attention to Ahmad Ibn Al-Mu&#8217;adhal and other scholars and so he gathered them in his home. Then he came out to them, so all of the people there stood up for him except Ahmad Ibn Al-Mu&#8217;adhal. So Al-Mutawakkil said to &#8216;Ubaidullaah. &#8216;This man does not agree with swearing allegiance to us (bay&#8217;ah).&#8217; So he (&#8216;Ubaidullaah) said to him: &#8216;Yes O Ameer Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, but he appears to have bad eyesight.&#8217; So Ahmad Ibn Al-Mu&#8217;adhal said: &#8216;O Ameer Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, I do not have any defect in my eyesight. But rather I removed you from the punishment of Allaah, the Most Exalted, for the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8216;Whosoever loves that men present themselves to him standing (up for him), then let him find his seat in the Hellfire.&#8217; So Al-Mutawakkil went to sit down beside him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Asaakir reported in Taareekh Dimashq (19/170/2) with his chain of narration to Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee:<br />
Some of the guards of &#8216;Umar Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez (the Khaleefah) narrated to me saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez came out one day while we were waiting for him on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah. So when we saw him, we stood up. So he said: &#8216;When you see me do not stand up but instead spread out (to make way for passing).'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fiqh (understanding) of the Hadeeth: This hadeeth indicates two matters to us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: The prohibition of someone loving that people stand up for him when he enters. And this evidence is clear such that there is no need for it to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: The disapproval of those sitting to stand up for the one who is entering, even if he doesn&#8217;t have a love for people standing up for him. This falls under the aspect of helping one another in goodness and avoiding opening the door to evil. And that is an accurate understanding that has been indicated to us by the narrator of the hadeeth, Mu&#8217;awiyah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, when he refused that &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Aamir stand up for him, and he used this hadeeth as evidence for what he said. He did this because of his understanding and knowledge of the Religion and it&#8217;s legal principles, which include &#8220;preventing the means&#8221;, and because of his awareness of the natural dispositions of humans and their reactions to good and evil factors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you were to imagine a community like the community of the first predecessors, they never practiced the custom of standing up for one another. It would be very rare that you find among them anyone that loved this kind of standing, which can throw someone into the Hellfire. And this was due to the lack of there being present that thing which would remind one about it – and it is the standing itself. On the other hand, if you were to look at a society like our society today, they have taken this particular type of standing as a normal custom. Indeed, this practice, particularly when done repeatedly, constantly reminds the person. So then the person&#8217;s soul desires it and finds pleasure in it until he ends up loving it. So when he loves it, he becomes ruined. So it becomes from the aspect of helping one another towards righteousness and Taqwaa to abandon doing this standing, even to those whom we feel don&#8217;t have a love for it, out of fear that our standing up for him will bring him to love it, for then we would be assisting him in bringing destruction to his soul and this is not permissible. Among the proofs that bear witness to this is when you see some of the people of knowledge of whom it is thought have good manners, their souls change when their eyes fall upon an individual that does not stand up for them. This is if they don&#8217;t become angry with him and attribute him with having little manners and give him the tidings of being prevented form the blessing of knowledge due to his lack of showing respect for its people, according to their claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, there is even among them he who calls others to stand, deceiving them with such sayings as &#8220;You do not stand up for me for the sake of a body of flesh and bones, but rather you only stand up for the knowledge that is contained in my chest!!&#8221; As if the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, did not have knowledge in his!! For the Companions did not used to stand up for him. Or is it that the Companions did not used to give him the respect that was befitting of him! So can a Muslim honestly say this or the other?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And due to this hadeeth and others beside it, a group of scholars have taken the opinion that it is prohibited to stand up for another person, as is stated in Al-Fath (4/14). Then he (Ibn Hajr) said: &#8220;The outcome of what has been reported on Maalik is the forbiddance of standing for the length of time that the one who is being stood up for doesn&#8217;t sit., even if he is busy serving himself. For he (Maalik) was asked about the woman who goes to great extents in hosting her husband, by receiving him, taking off his (outer) garments and standing until he sits? So he responded: &#8216;As for her receiving him, then there is nothing wrong with this. But as for her standing until he sits down, then no, for this is from the acts of the tyrants. And &#8216;Umar Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez forbade this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: There is nothing in this subject that presents a contradiction to the evidence found in this hadeeth at all. And those who oppose and hold the opinion that it is permissible to stand, rather that it is recommended, they use as evidence ahaadeeth, some of which are authentic and some of which are weak. But all of them, when one reflects on their chains of narration and texts do not present a contradiction to the evidences for that (prohibition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what further confirms and clarifies this is the Prophet&#8217;s dislike of people standing up for him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There was no individual in the world that was more beloved to them than the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And when they would see him, they would not stand up for him due to what they knew of his dislike for that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in Al-Adab-ul-Mufrad (946), At-Tirmidhee (2/125), At-Tahaawee in Mushkil-ul-Athaar (2/39), Ahmad (3/132), and Abu Ya&#8217;laa in his Musnad (2/183) and the wording is from him. It is from the path of Humaid on Anas, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu. And At-Tirmidhee said: &#8220;It is a hasan saheeh hadeeth, ghareeb from this perspective.&#8221; I say its chain of narration is authentic according to the standards of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth strengthens what the previous hadeeth has indicated from the forbiddance of standing out of respect and honor. This is since if standing up were a legislated form of showing respect, it would not be permitted for him sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to make it disliked for his Companions. And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, is the most deserving of people to be shown respect and honor. And they, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhum, were the most aware of people of what he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, deserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, hated this standing up for him to be done by his Companions. So therefore, it is upon the Muslims – especially if they are from the people of knowledge and exemplary figures – that they should hate that for themselves, in accordance with following his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, way. And they should hate that for those Muslims beside themselves due to his saying: &#8220;None of you truly believes untill he loves for his brother what he loves for himself from good.&#8221; So no one should stand up for him nor should he stand up for anyone. Rather their hatred for this standing should be greater than that of the Prophet&#8217;s hatred (for it). This is since if they do not hate it, it will become a normal practice for some of them to stand up for others. And that will lead them to hold a love for it, which then will serve as a cause for which they will be deserving of the Hellfire, as is stated in the previous hadeeth. And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was not like this, for he was free and protected from having any love for this act of disobedience. So if he also hated it along with that, it becomes clear that it is more fitting that the Muslim hate it. [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has gathered the comprehensive and abundant good manners in his saying: &#8220;He is not from us who doesn&#8217;t have mercy for our young, and respects our old and knows the right of our scholar.&#8221; [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowing the right of the scholar requires having good manners with him in his presence as well as in his absence. However, this does not require that one should worship him, as is the case with some of the Sufis and the extremists among the shaikhs. An example of this is standing up for the scholar when he enters the gathering. This act is not befitting for the pure and uncorrupted Islaamic society. So the main concern of the true Islaamic callers is to bring back as close as possible the first Islaamic society, in which it was not possible to adopt a practice any way they felt like. So indeed the matter is only as the famous saying goes: &#8220;So imitate them if you are not like them, Verily, imitation of the righteous is success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we are trying to imitate those righteous and good individuals (from the Salaf), and we are attempting to bring forth a society that resembles that first luminous society that existed in that radiant time. So our attention must always be directed towards doing what they used to do, as much as we are able to, for the reality is as his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying indicates: &#8220;Whatever I command you to do, then do as much of it as you are able. And what I forbid you from, then stay away from it.&#8221;32 So the matters related to actions are restricted and thus additions to them are not accepted. An example of that is being kind to the scholar by outward gestures, such as by standing up for him or others when they enter one of the gatherings. And I do not say the gatherings of knowledge, for this is very clear &#8211; that the students in that situation should not stand up for this scholar. However, if he enters a gathering that is not a gathering of knowledge, is it from the beneficial knowledge and from the righteous deeds that the people of that gathering stand up for that scholar who has entered the gathering?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: &#8220;So imitate them if you are not like them.&#8221; Who is the only single individual that we should imitate apart from others? He is, as we all know, Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah. And the people of knowledge know, and this is something that they do not differ about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nowadays, the whole Islaamic world – except for those whom Allaah has mercy on – is in opposition to the Prophet&#8217;s guidance of the past concerning this matter. So the people of knowledge do not forbid their companions nor the general people when one of them enters a gathering and they stand up for him. And those who stand up for him out of kindness and respect, they deem that this is how the first society (of the Companions) were. Therefore, it is upon us to constantly direct the attention towards physically imitating the (way of this) first society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from the matters of which it is obligatory upon the scholars, rather upon the students of knowledge, to take concern of. This is since if you are truthful in your imitation of the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then spread amongst your companions the fact that you hate this outward expression. This means to humble yourself as the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, used to humble himself. The Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, used to hate this standing and so the people accepted it, for in reality he hated this thing. So if the scholar is following the example of the Messenger then let him spread that amongst his companions. This comes first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, it falls into the realm of &#8220;preventing the means.&#8221; For instance, if the scholar makes it a normal habit for the people to stand up for him, his soul will yearn for this standing. Then there will come a time when he will see his student who loves him and is devoted to him. He used to stand up for him then all of a sudden he stopped standing up for him. So there will occur disputes, then blaming, then perhaps more than that between the scholar and the student. This is because this scholar made it a normal habit for himself to love this standing. So what brought him to fall into this hated and forbidden love was the people&#8217;s accustoming him to it. I also wanted to remind the scholar and the students of knowledge to not adapt the societies because this adapting (and conforming) has no fixed limits today, for an innovation may appear and we will say: “There is something more important than it.” And then tomorrow there will be another innovation and we will say what we said in the first instance, until the society has gone far away from acting in accordance with what Islaam has brought, due to these distortions and false justifications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<em> silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations –<em>hadeeth </em>no. 16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of <em>Abu Huraira</em>: “when the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to say farewell to someone, he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُ اللهَ دِينَكَ وَأَمَانَتَكَ وَخَوَاتِيمَ عَمَلِكَ<br />
</strong>(I entrust your religion, your family and belongings (that you are leaving behind), and the last of your deeds to Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A number of benefits are gained from this authentic <em>hadeeth</em>. First: the permissibility of saying farewell with the mentioned saying in it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُ اللهَ دِينَكَ وَأَمَانَتَكَ وَخَوَاتِيمَ عَمَلِكَ</strong>,’ and the traveler responds to him and says:‘<strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُكُمُ اللهَ الَّذِي لاَ تَضِيعُ وَدَائِعُهُ</strong>’ (I entrust you to Allaah, whose trusts are not lost).[1]Refer to ‘<em>Al-Kalim At-Tayyib</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: (the permissibility of) taking hold of one hand during handshaking, which has been mentioned in many narrations, and this <em>hadeeth</em> indicates the derivation of this word (‘handshaking’) in the (Arabic) language. According to<em>Lisaan ul-‘Arab:</em>[3] ‘<em>al-musaafaha</em> (handshaking) is taking hold of the hand, the same as <em>at-tasaafuh</em>. A man handshakes another man when he places the side of his palm in the side of the other’s palm, and the sides of their palms are the front of them – like the <em>hadeeth</em> of handshaking upon meeting, which is done with one another by joining the side of a palm with another palm and turning face-to-face.’ I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: there is that which reports this meaning as well in some of the previously mentioned narrations, such as the <em>marfoo’ hadeeth</em>[4] of<em>Hudhaifa</em>: ‘Indeed, if the believer meets another believer, then gives him the<em>salaam</em> and takes hold of his hand and handshakes him, their sins fall off as the leaves of trees fall off.’[5] <em>Al-Mundhuri</em> said: ‘<em>At-Tabaraani</em> narrated it in ‘<em>Al-Awsat</em>’ and I don’t know of anyone who was criticized among its narrators.’ I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it has evidences by which it rises to the rank of being authentic, such as (that which was reported) on the authority of <em>Anas </em>by<em> Ad-Dhiyaa Al-Maqdisee</em> in ‘<em>Al-Mukhtaara</em>,’ which <em>al-Mundhuri </em>attributed to <em>Ahmad</em>and others. So all these narrations indicate that <strong>the <em>sunnah</em> in handshaking is taking hold of one hand</strong>; therefore, the handshaking with <strong>both</strong> hands that some of the scholars do is <strong>against the <em>Sunnah</em></strong>, so let this be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third benefit: that handshaking is legislated at the time of parting as well… The reason for inferring, rather quoting (this) becomes clear by remembering the permissibility of (giving) the <em>salaam</em> when parting as well due to his (the Prophet’s) saying (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>): ‘If one of you enters the gathering then let him give the<em> salaam</em>, and if he leaves then let him give the<em>salaam</em>, as the first one is not more deserving (to be said) than the other one,’[6]<em>Abu Daawood</em>, <em>at-Tirmidhi</em> and others narrated it with a <em>hasan</em> (good) chain of narration. So the saying of some (people) is that handshaking at the time of parting is an innovation which has no truth. Yes, indeed the one who reads the mentioned narrations about handshaking when meeting will find them to be more in number and stronger than the mentioned narrations about handshaking when parting; and the one who is intelligent will conclude from that, that the permissibility of the second handshaking is not like that of the first (handshaking) in rank. <strong>Therefore,</strong> <strong>the first one is <em>sunnah</em> and the second one is recommended.</strong> As for (the latter) being an innovation, then no (this is not true) due to the evidence that we mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And<strong> as for handshaking immediately after the prayers, then it is undoubtedly an innovation</strong>, except if (the handshaking) takes place between two persons who have not met before that, then it is <em>sunnah</em> as you learned.”</p>

<td style="text-align:justify;" valign="top">Doctor Saud al-&#8216;Ajaaji who was amongst those who accompanied Shaykh al-&#8216;Uthaymeen on the last medical trip he made to Boston (a city in America) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whilst we were leaving the hotel where we were staying in, a little American boy who was with his mother stood in front of him &#8211; the Shaykh caught his attention because of his Saudi thawb and abayah &#8211; so he began to touch him on his head and to play with him. So his mother asked him to greet the Shaykh and he returned an even better greeting. Then the Shaykh said directing his speech to the mother &#8216;May Allaah guide you to Islaam&#8217; all during which he kept lowering his gaze. Then the mother told her son to bid the Shaykh farewell by saying to her son, &#8216;Tell him have a nice day.&#8217; So the Shaykh asked me what he said, I told him he said ‘Have a nice day.’ However some of those who were accompanying him became annoyed because of the way in which the woman was dressed. One of them even made some remarks towards her, but the Shaykh did not like this and he said, &#8216;O brothers this is not from the mannerisms of Islaam, the mother and he son were smiling at us and they were very cordial in speech, so it is upon us to reciprocate the favour. So rather then make du&#8217;aa against them, we should make du&#8217;aa for her which by the way is the path of this exalted religion.&#8217;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Shaykh ul –Islaam <strong>Ibn Al Qayyim</strong> as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-</em><br />
From his book ‘Za’ad al-Ma’aad’<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> said:</p>
<p>‘Every Muslim should be warned of the oppression of:  <strong>‘I – My/Mine – I Possess’</strong></p>
<p>Indeed these three words are what Iblees (Shaytan), Fir’awn and Qaroon were tried with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iblees said: ‘<strong>I am </strong>better than him’</li>
<li>Fir’awn said: ‘Is not <strong>mine</strong> the Kingdom of Egypt,’</li>
<li>Qaroon said: ‘This has been given to me only because of knowledge <strong>I possess</strong>.’</li>
</ul>
<p>So regarding the saying of the Slave of Allaah ‘<strong>I</strong>’ – then the best that he can be described with is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">I am a slave who sins, makes mistakes, seeks forgiveness and recognizes this</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So regarding the saying of ‘<strong>My/Mine</strong>’ – and those statements similar to that is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">My sins, my crimes, my humbleness, my depravation and submissiveness.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So regarding the saying of ‘<strong>I Possess</strong>’:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Forgive me for my mistakes and what I do intentionally, in jest, or in seriousness and I possess all these shortcomings.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Taken from ‘Za’ad al-Ma’aad’ 2/475 – By Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawzeeyah]</span></p>
