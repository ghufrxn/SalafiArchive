<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 76 : Point 127</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The greeting of salaam is to be given to all of Allah’s worshippers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F408009939&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allah created Adam (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>), He said to him: `Go and greet that company of angels who are sitting there – and then listen to what they are going to say in reply to your greetings because that will be your greeting and your off-spring’s.’ Adam (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the angels: `<em>As-Salamu `Alaikum</em> (may you be safe from evil).’ They replied:<em> `As-Salamu `Alaikum wa Rahmatullah</em> (may you be safe from evil, and Mercy of Allah be upon you).’ Thus adding in reply to him: `<em>wa Rahmatullah</em> (and Mercy of Allah)’ to his greeting.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them.</span>” (24:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e., say: As-Salamu `alaikum – peace be on you), blessed and good</span>.” (24:61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally</span>.” (4:86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibril (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibrahim (Abraham)? When they came in to him, and said, `Salam (peace be upon you)!’ He answered: `Salam (peace be upon you).</span>”’ (51:24,25)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #2: “What is the authenticity of adding <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>[1] in offering the<em>salaam</em> and responding to it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no addition (of <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>) in the <em>hadeeth </em>with respect to offering the <em>salaam</em>; i.e., if a person starts with offering the <em>salaam</em>, he ends at <em>wa barakaatuh</em>: <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh.</em> And the<em>hadeeth</em> that has come – or in more precise words, (the <em>hadeeth</em>) that was narrated – (stating) that at the fourth time, the fourth of them said, <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh wa maghfiratuh</em>, then this is a weak narration. As for the addition (of <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>) in the response to <em>wa barakaatuh</em>, then it is established; i.e., a man says, <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</em>, then we add <em>wa maghfiratuh</em> in the response…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in agreement with the noble <em>Qur’aan</em> (with) the saying ‘When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.’[2] So if the greeter gives the <em>salaam</em>, saying <em>asalaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuh</em>, the <em>aayah</em> that stated ‘greet in return with what is better than it’ is not invalidated; this command still exists, which is (followed by saying) <em>wa maghfiratuh</em>. This addition (with respect to responding) has also been mentioned in…narrations established from some of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we have brought out a conclusion whose summary is that<strong> adding <em>wa maghfiratuh</em> in the response is allowed and starting (the <em>salaam</em> with it) is not allowed</strong>.”</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[1] saying ‘and His Forgiveness’ after the greeting ‘may Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allaah be upon you’<br />
[2] <em>Surat un-Nisaa</em>, 4:86</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;">AUTHOR: Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam bin Barjiss</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> SOURCE: Al-I’laam ‘an ba’adi Ahkaam-is-Salaam (pg. 36-37)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people ask on the ruling of what some people do nowadays, such as the shaking of hands between those next to each other – on the right and justify – after finishing from performing the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, answered this type of question when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Shaking hands after prayer is not prescribed in the Sunnah. Rather, it is an innovation, and Allaah knows best.”</strong></span> [Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa: 23/339]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how beautiful is what Ibn-ul-Haaj, may Allaah have mercy on him, said, whilst advising the student of knowledge:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And he should refrain from what they have introduced from shaking hands after the Morning Prayer, the ‘Asr Prayer and the Jumu’ah Prayer. In fact, some of them in these times have even gone so far as to do this after all of the five daily prayers! And all of this is from innovations. The proper place for shaking hands, according to the Religion, is only at the time when a Muslim encounters his brother, not after the five daily prayers. All of this is from innovations. Wherever the Religion has placed it (i.e. the act of shaking hands), we too should place it. Therefore, this act (of shaking hands after prayer) should be avoided and the one who does it should be reprimanded for what he has brought forth from opposition to the Sunnah.”</strong></span> [Al-Madkhal: 2/223]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Ibn Hajr Al-Haytamee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What people do from shaking hands directly after the five daily prayers is detested (makrooh). It has no basis in the Religion.”</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Some scholars have also indicated that shaking hands after prayer is from the ways of the Rawaafid, may Allaah debase them</strong></span>. [See As-Si’aayah (pg. 264) of the great scholar AlLuknawee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslim, after having heard the words of the scholars on this aspect of shaking hands (after every prayer), you have no choice except but to abandon it, detest it and instruct the people to forsake it, out of caution from falling into innovations, which violate an individual’s religion and detract from his deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must know that these scholars’ ruling this act of shaking hands (after prayer) to be an innovation is based on the premise that it is an act of worship that was introduced after the time of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the first three generations (of Muslims, i.e. the Salaf). The Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: “<strong>Whoever does a deed that is not in conformity with our affair (i.e. Sunnah), he is rejected</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you will surely be amazed at how innovations cling tightly onto the hearts of those who were raised upon it to the point that they become like armor for these innovations, protecting it from harm and destruction, whereas Ahlus-Sunnah suffer weakness and humiliation for the sake of defending and reviving the acts of the Sunnah and refuting and showing sternness against those who oppose it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Don’t you see this innovation and how the people guard it, believing it to be an act of nearness to Allaah? This is such that if a person were to give the slightest hint that he dislikes such an act, the people will call out to him from every direction accusing him of having brought a new religion!! And all of this came about due to the scholars’ laxity in waging war against innovations – even though they be small – and due to their leniency in implementing the Sunnah – even though it may cause divisions. So verily, to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return. And Allaah is sufficient for us and the best of guardians.</p>

Excellence of Greeting the Acquaintance Repeatedly</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>859.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)reported in the Hadith in respect of the person who was at fault in performing his Salat (prayer): He came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and greeted him. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) responded to the greeting and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go back and repeat your Salat because you have not performed the Salat (properly).&#8221;</span> He again performed Salat as he had prayed before and came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and greeted him. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) responded to the greetings (and repeated his words to him). This act of repeating (the Salat and the Salam) was done thrice.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>860.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you meets a brother (in Faith) he should greet him. Then if a tree or a wall or a stone intervenes between them and then he meets him again, he should greet him.&#8221;</span><br />

Excellence of Promoting Greetings</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;<b>O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them.&#8221;</b></span><b> (24:27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e., say: As-Salamu `alaikum &#8211; peace be on you), blessed and good.&#8221;</b></span><b> (24:61)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.&#8221;</b></span><b> (4:86)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibril (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibrahim (Abraham)? When they came in to him, and said, `Salam (peace be upon you)!&#8217; He answered: `Salam (peace be upon you).&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (51:24,25)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>845.</b> Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;Which act in Islam is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">To give food, and to greet everyone, whether you know or you do not.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>846.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When Allah created Adam (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), He said to him: `Go and greet that company of angels who are sitting there &#8211; and then listen to what they are going to say in reply to your greetings because that will be your greeting and your off-spring&#8217;s.&#8217; Adam (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the angels: `As-Salamu `Alaikum (may you be safe from evil).&#8217; They replied: `As-Salamu `Alaikum wa Rahmatullah (may you be safe from evil, and Mercy of Allah be upon you).&#8217; Thus adding in reply to him: `wa Rahmatullah (and Mercy of Allah)&#8217; to his greeting.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>847.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded us to do seven things: to visit the sick, to follow the funeral (of a dead believer), to invoke the Mercy of Allah upon one who sneezes (i.e., by saying to him: Yarhamuk-Allah), to support the weak, to help the oppressed, to promote the greeting of `As-Salamu `Alaikum&#8217;, and to help those who swear to do something to keep their oaths.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>848.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Him in Whose Hand is my life! You will not enter Jannah until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I inform you of something which, if you do, you will love one another? Promote greetings amongst yourselves.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>849.</b> `Abdullah bin Salam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people, exchange greetings of peace (i.e., say: As-Salamu `Alaikum to one another), feed people, strengthen the ties of kinship, and be in prayer when others are asleep, you will enter Jannah in peace.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>850.</b> At-Tufail bin Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I used to visit `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) in the morning and accompany him to the market. `Abdullah offered greetings of peace to every one he met on the way, be they sellers of petty goods, traders or poor people. One day when I came to him, he asked me to accompany him to the market. I said to him:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;What is the point of your going to the market when you do not sell, nor ask about articles, nor offer a price for them, nor sit down with any company of people. Let us sit down here and talk.&#8221;</span> He replied:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Abu Batn (belly)! (Tufail had a large belly), we go to the market to greet everyone we meet.&#8221;</span><br />
[Malik].</p>

<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Salutations and Greetings  (Kitab As-Salam) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way  the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a  society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators  of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the  pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good  Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no  spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one&#8217;s mornings and  evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the  time of meeting are as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance  behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within  and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on  every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be  constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness  of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind.  peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important feature of words of greeting  in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted  but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the  blessing of peace. (The pronoun&#8217;Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come  within its orbit.) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The two words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum may be called the  irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been  commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another  in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum are generally  suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings).  These three words:&#8221; peace&#8230;, mercy&#8221; and&#8221; blessings of Allah&#8221; in fact  form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another  these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in  perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of  as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this  essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the  whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility  of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for  it. </font></p>

We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of    doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation    amongst ourselves.

You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in    a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren,    would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There happened to come &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf and he had    been absent in connection with some of his needs. He said: I have with me a knowledge of    it, that I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you hear of its    presence (the presence of plague) in a land, don&#8217;t enter it, but if it spreads in the land    where you are, don&#8217;t fly from it. Thereupon &#8216;Umar b. Khattab praised Allah and then went    back?</font></p>

Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of    that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith,    however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words    in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said:    No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you    say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and    His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very    night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on    the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do    a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of    heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of    this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of    the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then    the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the    heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages    to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack    them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but    they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</font></p>

The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing    between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her    with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house    until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on    the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in    the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died    first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and    made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to    life.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer . </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From 58 Surah Al Mujadlah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden,) He said, &#8220;The Jews.&#8221; Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, &#8220;The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and conspired together for sin and wrongdoing and disobedience to the Messenger.) means, they used to talk to each other,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for sin) which involves themselves,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and wrongdoing) which effects others. They speak about disobedience and defying of the Messenger , with persistence and recommending each other to follow their way,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Prophet and greeted him by saying, `As-Sam `Alayka, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O `A&#8217;ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech.) I said, `Didn&#8217;t you hear them say, `As-Sam Alayka&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Didn&#8217;t you hear me answering them back by saying, `Wa `Alaykum (And the same upon you)&#8217;) Allah the Exalted then sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,)&#8221; The narration collected in the Sahih states that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;And be upon you the death, disgrace and curse.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah said to her,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah accepts our supplication against them, but not theirs against us.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A Jew passed by Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said to his Companions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Rather he said, Sam `Alaykum.) meaning, `may you disgrace your religion.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.&#8217; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of the Book greet you, say, `Wa `Alaykum.&#8217;)&#8221; meaning, `and the same on you too.&#8217; The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A&#8217;ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say within themselves:&#8221;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221;) means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.&#8217; Allah the Exalted replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, &#8220;Sam `Alayka,&#8221; to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . They would say then within themselves, &#8220;Why does Allah not punish us for what we say&#8221; This Ayah was later revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: &#8220;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221; Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir . The Noble Qur&#8217;an An-Nisa 4:86</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.) meaning, if the Muslim greets you with the Salam, then return the greeting with a better Salam, or at least equal to the Salam that was given. Therefore, the better Salam is recommended, while returning it equally is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Raja&#8217; Al-`Utaridi said that `Imran bin Husayn said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum&#8221;. The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Ten.&#8221; Another man came and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Twenty.&#8221; Then another man came and said, &#8220;As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuh.&#8221; The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, &#8220;Thirty.&#8221; This is the narration recorded by Abu Dawud. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Al-Bazzar also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;Hasan Gharib&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several other Hadiths on this subject from Abu Sa`id, `Ali, and Sahl bin Hanif. When the Muslim is greeted with the full form of Salam, he is obliged to return the greeting equally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl Adh-Dhimmah the Salam should not be initiated nor should the greeting be added to when returning their greeting. Rather, as recorded in the Two Sahihs their greeting is returned to them equally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the Jews greet you, one of them would say, `As-Samu `Alayka (death be unto you).&#8217; Therefore, say, `Wa `Alayka (and the same to you).&#8217;) In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not initiate greeting the Jews and Christians with the Salam, and when you pass by them on a road, force them to its narrowest path.) Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love each other. Should I direct you to an action that would direct you to love each other Spread the Salam among yourselves.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We joined a karate club in America, and when our trainer told us that we had to bow to him after he bowed to us, we refused, explaining to him that we couldn&#8217;t because of our religion. He accepted our excuse but then he said that we had to bow our heads at least. He said that since he began the greeting by bowing, we had to respond. What is the ruling in this issue?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To greet somebody by bowing is unlawful, regardless whether that person is a Muslim or a disbeliever, and <strong>regardless whether you bow with our entire upper body or with your head only</strong>. This is because bowing is a kind of worship, and worship is for Allaah Almighty alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send peace and blessing upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Some brothers limit their speech by; ‘good morning…good evening’ instead of ‘assalâmu alaykum wa rahmatu Allâh wa barakâtuh’ ie the greeting of Islâm. So is there any advice concerning this?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, that is not permitted. What is obligatory is to start with the ‘Salâm’. ‘Assalâmu alaykum. You do not say ‘good morning’ and ‘good evening’ but rather say: ‘Assalâmu alaykum. And if he said; ‘wa rahmatu Allâh wa barakatuh’ is better and perfect/complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Thereafter (after starting with the Salaam) he may says; ‘Good morning’, ‘may Allâh give you a good morning’, ‘may Allâh give you a good evening’, ‘how are you’, ‘how are your children’, ‘how is your family’, (this is) a good added greeting. However he starts by saying; ‘Assalâmu alaykum and that is the minimum. And if he added ‘wa rahmatu Allâh wa barakâtuh’ then that is better.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is how the Prophet (peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him) was with his companions. One time a man came in (joined them) and said: “Assalâmu ‘alaykum (peace be upon you).” The Prophet said, “[He will have] ten hasanât (rewards).” Another man passed by and said “Assalâmu ‘alaykum wa rahmatu Allâh.” The Prophet, “[He will have] twenty hasanât.” Another man passed by and said “Assalâmu ‘alaykum wa rahmatu Allâhi wa barakâtuh.” The Prophet, “[He will have] thirty hasanât.” [Bukhâri]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the virtue of that point of view.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the ruling on</strong><strong> gesturing Salam (Islamic greeting of peace) by waving? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>Salam should be pronounced and not gestured, for this is the greeting of the Jews. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade it, unless the one being greeted is far away or deaf; hence, one should wave along with offering Salam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q 5: Allah has facilitated means of transportation for us, including cars. I frequently meet people while driving and offer the Salam (Islamic greeting of peace), but some are not aware that I greet them except when I waive with my hand while uttering the Salam. Am I to blame if I raise my hand, given that I know this is forbidden? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>There is no harm in waving during offering the Salam in this case.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="ItwasnarratedthattheProphetpeacebeuponhimgreetedagroupofwomenandwavedwithhishand"></a> It was narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) greeted a group of women and waved with his hand. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />He (peace be upon him) meant, and Allah knows best, to make them understand that he was greeting them. However, it is not permissible to substitute Salam by waving.May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q 3: Is it permissible</strong><strong> for children to bow when greeting or meeting their elders to show respect or honor them? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>Scholars are unanimous that it is impermissible to bow to any creature. Bowing should only be to Allah to express His glorification. Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have prohibited bowing to other than Allah. In the Hadith reported on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), a man asked him:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="OMessengerofAllahshouldapersonbowwhenhemeetshisMuslimbrotherorfriend?HesaidNo"></a> O Messenger of Allah, should a person bow when he meets his Muslim brother or friend? He said: No. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />(Related by Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<em> silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations –<em>hadeeth </em>no. 16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of <em>Abu Huraira</em>: “when the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to say farewell to someone, he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُ اللهَ دِينَكَ وَأَمَانَتَكَ وَخَوَاتِيمَ عَمَلِكَ<br />
</strong>(I entrust your religion, your family and belongings (that you are leaving behind), and the last of your deeds to Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A number of benefits are gained from this authentic <em>hadeeth</em>. First: the permissibility of saying farewell with the mentioned saying in it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُ اللهَ دِينَكَ وَأَمَانَتَكَ وَخَوَاتِيمَ عَمَلِكَ</strong>,’ and the traveler responds to him and says:‘<strong>أَسْتَوْدِعُكُمُ اللهَ الَّذِي لاَ تَضِيعُ وَدَائِعُهُ</strong>’ (I entrust you to Allaah, whose trusts are not lost).[1]Refer to ‘<em>Al-Kalim At-Tayyib</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: (the permissibility of) taking hold of one hand during handshaking, which has been mentioned in many narrations, and this <em>hadeeth</em> indicates the derivation of this word (‘handshaking’) in the (Arabic) language. According to<em>Lisaan ul-‘Arab:</em>[3] ‘<em>al-musaafaha</em> (handshaking) is taking hold of the hand, the same as <em>at-tasaafuh</em>. A man handshakes another man when he places the side of his palm in the side of the other’s palm, and the sides of their palms are the front of them – like the <em>hadeeth</em> of handshaking upon meeting, which is done with one another by joining the side of a palm with another palm and turning face-to-face.’ I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: there is that which reports this meaning as well in some of the previously mentioned narrations, such as the <em>marfoo’ hadeeth</em>[4] of<em>Hudhaifa</em>: ‘Indeed, if the believer meets another believer, then gives him the<em>salaam</em> and takes hold of his hand and handshakes him, their sins fall off as the leaves of trees fall off.’[5] <em>Al-Mundhuri</em> said: ‘<em>At-Tabaraani</em> narrated it in ‘<em>Al-Awsat</em>’ and I don’t know of anyone who was criticized among its narrators.’ I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it has evidences by which it rises to the rank of being authentic, such as (that which was reported) on the authority of <em>Anas </em>by<em> Ad-Dhiyaa Al-Maqdisee</em> in ‘<em>Al-Mukhtaara</em>,’ which <em>al-Mundhuri </em>attributed to <em>Ahmad</em>and others. So all these narrations indicate that <strong>the <em>sunnah</em> in handshaking is taking hold of one hand</strong>; therefore, the handshaking with <strong>both</strong> hands that some of the scholars do is <strong>against the <em>Sunnah</em></strong>, so let this be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third benefit: that handshaking is legislated at the time of parting as well… The reason for inferring, rather quoting (this) becomes clear by remembering the permissibility of (giving) the <em>salaam</em> when parting as well due to his (the Prophet’s) saying (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>): ‘If one of you enters the gathering then let him give the<em> salaam</em>, and if he leaves then let him give the<em>salaam</em>, as the first one is not more deserving (to be said) than the other one,’[6]<em>Abu Daawood</em>, <em>at-Tirmidhi</em> and others narrated it with a <em>hasan</em> (good) chain of narration. So the saying of some (people) is that handshaking at the time of parting is an innovation which has no truth. Yes, indeed the one who reads the mentioned narrations about handshaking when meeting will find them to be more in number and stronger than the mentioned narrations about handshaking when parting; and the one who is intelligent will conclude from that, that the permissibility of the second handshaking is not like that of the first (handshaking) in rank. <strong>Therefore,</strong> <strong>the first one is <em>sunnah</em> and the second one is recommended.</strong> As for (the latter) being an innovation, then no (this is not true) due to the evidence that we mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And<strong> as for handshaking immediately after the prayers, then it is undoubtedly an innovation</strong>, except if (the handshaking) takes place between two persons who have not met before that, then it is <em>sunnah</em> as you learned.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We joined a karate club in America, and when our trainer told us that we had to bow to him after he bowed to us, we refused, explaining to him that we couldnt because of our religion. He accepted our excuse but then he said that we had to bow our heads at least. He said that since he began the greeting by bowing, we had to respond. What is the ruling in this issue?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To greet somebody by bowing is unlawful, regardless whether that person is a Muslim or a disbeliever, and regardless whether you bow with our entire upper body or with your head only. This is because <strong>bowing is a kind of worship</strong>, and worship is for Allaah Almighty alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send peace and blessing upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>
