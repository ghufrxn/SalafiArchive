										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Saalih bin &#8216;Abdil-&#8216;Azeez As-Sindee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author dispels many of the false claims and accusations that are spread and circulated about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab died 1206H] by using the Imaam&#8217;s own testimony from statements he made in his writings. The author brings seven of the most popular misconceptions that surround Imaam Ibn Abdil-Wahhaab and his da&#8217;wah and refutes them through the words of the Imaam, as has been recorded in his writings and collected by reliable sources into compilations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By doing this we clearly see the Imaam&#8217;s position with regard to these fundamental issues based on his own testimony and not having to rely on someone else&#8217;s explanation in his defense. We hope that through this treatise, those who have doubt about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab and his call, can gain clarity about the true state of affairs and not listen to the lies and slander of his opponents who seek and strive to discredit the tremendous efforts of this great reformer.</p>

<p><strong>Read the Book Below:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For many years and long decades now, there has been much talk and debate going on about Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) and his da’wah between those who agree and those who disagree, and those who accuse him and those who defend him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But anyone who looks at the words of those who oppose the Shaikh, those who attach all kinds of accusations to him, will find that their words are void of any proof. This is since there can’t be found any basis for what they claim either in his statements or in his books. Rather, they are just allegations mentioned by those in the past and repeated by those in later times, nothing more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I think a fair and just person would only agree that the best and most correct way to find out the truth about him would be by returning to and taking from the main source (i.e. the Shaikh himself).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the books of the Shaikh are present and his words are preserved. And by looking into them, one can find out the truth or falsehood of what is being spread about him. And as for the claims that are void of evidences then they are just a mirage and not real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these following pages, I will present brief excerpts from the speech of Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, using quotes from him, which I relied on from the trustworthy books that have collected all of his statements. And I have not added anything to them except for arranging them in order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These quotes consist of responses from the Shaikh himself against the most popular accusations that his opponents launch against him, in which he asserts the opposite of what they claim. I am certain that, by Allaah’s Guidance, these responses will suffice in clarifying the truth to those who seek it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who reject the Shaikh and oppose his Da’wah, those who spend their time spreading falsehood and circulating lies, then I say to them: Lie against your own selves for indeed the truth is clear and indeed the Religion of Allaah is victorious, and the sun shines bright, one cannot cover it with his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here is the speech of the Shaikh, which disproves these claims and refutes all of your accusations. So if you have some speech from him that contradicts it then bring it out in the open and do not conceal it. And if you can’t do this, and you will not be able to do it, then I counsel you with one piece of advice: That you stand up for Allaah, free from every vain desire or bigotry, and ask Him sincerely to show you the truth and to guide you to it. Then reflect on what this man said – did he bring forth something better than the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then reflect a second time: Is there any other way to salvation than speaking the truth and believing in the truth? So if the truth becomes clear to you, then return to your guidance and go back to the truth, for that is better than lingering upon falsehood. And to Allaah return all the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE REALITY OF THE DA’WAH OF SHAIKH MUHAMMAD BIN ‘ABDIL-WAHHAAB</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is proper to begin this discussion by relaying some brief words from Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, in which he explains the reality of what he was calling to, far removed from the dark clouds of propaganda that his opponents have placed as an obstacle between many people and that Da’wah. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, and to Allaah belongs the Praise and the Blessing, and all might is by Him, that my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, an upright religion, the pure monotheistic way of Ibraaheem, and he wasn’t from the polytheists. And I, all praise be to Allaah, do not call to a madh-hab (way) of Sufism or (a madh-hab) of a Fiqh scholar or a speaker or one of the Imaams that they magnify.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the contrary, I call to Allaah alone and with no partner. And I call to the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger, which he advised the first part of his ummah and the last part of it to abide by. And I hope that I will not reject the truth if it comes to me. In fact, I call on Allaah, His angels and all of His creation to bear witness that if one of you brings one word of truth to me that I should accept it immediately and throw against the wall everything that opposes it, from the statements of my Imaams, with the exception of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) for indeed he doesn’t speak anything but the truth.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I, all praise be to Allaah, am a follower (muttabi’) and not an innovator (mubtadi’).” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab: 5/36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct representation of the affair is that I say: No one should be supplicated to except Allaah, alone and with no partner, as Allaah says in His Book: ‘So do not call unto anyone along with Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 18] And He said about the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: It is not in my power to cause you harm or to bring you to the Right Path.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 21] So this is the Speech of Allaah, which the Messenger of Allaah mentioned to us and counseled us with. And this is what stands between me and you, for if he mentioned something besides this, then it is a lie and a slander.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/90-91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE FIRST ISSUE: THE SHAIKH’S BELIEF WITH REGARD TO THE PROPHET</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh is charged by his enemies with terrible accusations related to his belief concerning the Prophet. These accusations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: That he didn’t believe he was the last of the Prophets. This is what is claimed (!), but yet all the books of the Shaikh are filled with a refutation of this misconception and they testify that this claim is a lie. Some examples are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I believe that our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is the seal (last) of the prophets and messengers. And the Eemaan (Faith) of a servant (person) is not valid unless he believes in his messengership and bears witness to his prophethood.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the most prosperous of creatures and those who will have the greatest blessing and highest level are those who are foremost in following him (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and in conforming with him in knowledge and action.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That he violates the right of the Prophet and doesn’t give him the position he deserves. In order to find out the reality of this claim, I will quote some of his statements in which he clearly asserts what his belief is with regard to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Because Allaah wanted His Tawheed to be supreme and His Religion to be completed and because He wanted His Word to be the highest and the Word of the disbelievers to be the lowest, He sent Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the last of the prophets and the loved one of the Lord of creation. So he did not cease to be known throughout every generation, being mentioned in the Torah of Moosaa and the Gospel of ‘Eesaa, until Allaah brought forth that pearl from between the tribes of Kinaanah and Zahra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he brought him out during a period of time that was void of messengers, and guided him to the most upright of paths. So he had signs and indicators that proved his prophethood before he was even sent forth (with the message), which amazed the people of his time. And Allaah brought him up in a good manner. That’s why he was the noblest, the best mannered, the nicest neighbor, the most lenient and the most truthful in speech amongst his people. This was such that his people would call him ‘Al-Ameen’ (The Trustworthy One), because of what Allaah gave him from righteous conditions and praiseworthy characteristics.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/19, 90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is the chief of the intercessors, possessor of the most praiseworthy station, and Aadam as well as those besides him will be under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first of the messengers was Nooh, and the last and most virtuous of them was Muhammad.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He clarified with the most profound of clarifications (i.e. the Religion) and he completed and finalized it. He was the most sincere of creatures towards the servants of Allaah, and he was compassionate and merciful to the believers. He conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and he made true Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah. And he worshipped Allaah until certainty (i.e. death) reached him.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he (rahimahullaah) mentioned that one of the benefits derived from the Prophet’s statement: “None of you truly believes until I become more beloved to him than his father, his son, and all of mankind” is the obligation of loving him above loving one’s self, family and wealth. [Kitaab at-Tawheed: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: They claim that he rejected the Prophet’s intercession. The Shaikh responds to this misconception by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They claim that we reject the Prophet’s intercession. Far removed is Allaah from imperfections, this is a great slander. Rather, we bear witness before Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah is the intercessor and possessor of the praiseworthy station. We ask Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Mighty Throne, that He allow him to intercede for us and that he resurrect us under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No one rejects the Prophet’s intercession except for the people of innovation and misguidance. However, the intercession will not occur unless permission is granted first (by Allaah) and He is pleased with it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And no one will intercede except for he whom He is pleased with.’ [Surah Al- Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who is it that will intercede in His presence except by His permission.’ [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh explains the reason why this false claim was spread about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These people, when I mentioned to them what Allaah and His Messenger, as well as the scholars from all the groups, stated about the obligation of making the worship solely for Allaah and the prohibition of resembling the People of the Scripture who came before us in the aspect of taking their priests and rabbis as lords besides Allaah, they said to us: ‘You have degraded the status of the prophets, righteous people and the awliyaa (friends of Allaah)!’” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SECOND ISSUE: THE PROPHET’S HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the many accusations directed at the Shaikh is that he didn’t love the members of the Prophet’s Household and that he violated their rights. The response to this is that what is claimed is in contradiction to the true state of affairs. In fact, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, fully acknowledged the right that they had of being loved and honored, and he abided by it. In fact, he would even rebuke those who didn’t abide by this, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has obligated certain rights for the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger, which they have over the people. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon their rights thinking that to be part of Tawheed. Rather this is from extremism. The only thing we reject is honoring them for the sake of the (false) claim that they have the right to be worshipped, as well as honoring those who claim this.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/284]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever reflects on the life and history of the Shaikh will realize the truthfulness of what he stated here. It is enough to know that the Shaikh named six of his seven children with names from the Prophet’s Household, may Allaah be pleased with them: ‘Alee, ‘Abdullaah, Husayn, Hasan, Ibraaheem and Faatimah. This is a clear proof of the great love and respect he had for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE THIRD ISSUE: THE WONDROUS OCCURRENCES OF THE AWLIYAA</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people spread around that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab denied the extraordinary occurrences (karaamaat) of the awliyaa (close friends of Allaah). What disproves this false claim is that the Shaikh has clearly affirmed in several places of his Creed the opposite of what is spread around about him concerning this issue. An example of this is the statements he makes in some of his speech in which he explains his belief and creed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I affirm the karaamaat (wondrous occurrences) of the awliyaa.” [Ad-Durar As- Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wonder how the Shaikh can be accused of such a claim when he is the one who described those who deny the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa as people of innovation and misguidance, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And no one rejects the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa except for the people of innovation and misguidance.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FOURTH ISSUE: TAKFEER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the greatest of misconceptions that are spread about the Shaikh and his followers is that they declare the general masses of Muslims to be disbelievers (i.e. takfeer), and that they claim that marrying them is not valid except for those who are part of them or those who join their group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has refuted this misconception in numerous places, amongst them are: “The statement that we declare the Muslims to be disbelievers generally is from the lies of the enemies who wish to prevent people from this Religion. So we say: ‘Glorified and far removed are You (O Allaah), this is a tremendous slander!’ [Surah An-Noor: 16]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They have ascribed to us various lies, and so the fitnah has increased. Amongst these lies are: Spreading slander, which any sane person would be shy to transmit, not to mention be fooled by. An example of this is what you have mentioned that I deem all people to be disbelievers except for those who follow me, and that I claim that marrying them is not valid! How strange that such a notion could enter into the mind of a sane person! Would a Muslim say such a thing?! I absolve myself before Allaah from this claim, which only emanates from one with deficient intellect and no understanding. So may Allaah curse the people of evil and false objectives.” [Ad- Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person I deem to be a disbeliever is the one who knows the Religion of the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), but then after coming to know it, turns to reviling it and forbidding the people from it and making enmity with those who adhere to it. This is the person that I declare to be a disbeliever. And the majority of the ummah (i.e. Muslims), all praise be to Allaah, are not like this.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FIFTH ISSUE: THE WAY OF THE KHAWAARIJ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people who accuse the Shaikh of being upon the beliefs of the Khawaarij, those who declare Muslims disbelievers because of sins. The response to this from the words of the Shaikh is as follows: He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I do not testify for any of the Muslims that he is in Paradise or the Hellfire except for those who Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) testified it for. However, I wish well for the good-doer and I fear for the evildoer. And I do not deem anyone amongst the Muslims to be a disbeliever due to a sin, nor do I extract him from the fold of Islaam.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SIXTH ISSUE: TAJSEEM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also spread about the Shaikh is that he was a mujassim, i.e. that he likened Allaah’s attributes to the creation’s attributes.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has mentioned his belief concerning this aspect, and he is far removed from the lies his opponents accuse him of. He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the Belief (Eemaan) in Allaah, is that one believes in what Allaah has described Himself with in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), without committing tahreef (distortion) or ta’teel (denial). Rather, he must believe that there is nothing equal to Allaah and that he is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. So he must not negate what Allaah described Himself with, nor should he distort the words from their true state, nor should he deny His Names and Attributes, nor should he say how Allaah’s Attributes are or resemble them to the creation’s attributes. This is because Allaah has no equals or rivals or similars, nor can He be compared to His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah is the most knowledgeable about Himself and about others, and He is the most truthful in words and the best in speech. So He has removed Himself from what His opponents from the people who commit takyeef and tamtheel have described Him with, and from what those who commit tahreef and ta’teel have negated from Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far removed is your Lord, the Lord of Glory and Might, from what they ascribe to Him, and peace be on the Messengers. And all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all that is created.’ [Surah As-Saafaat: 180-182]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/29] “It is well known that ta’teel is the opposite of tajseem, and those who commit this (ta’teel) are enemies of those who commit that (tajseem). The truth lies in between these two (extremes).” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 3/11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SEVENTH ISSUE: OPPOSING THE SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab opposed the rest of the scholars in what he called to, not turning to their statements or relying on their books. Rather, he introduced something new and brought forth a fifth madh-hab. The best person to clarify the reality of this issue is the Shaikh himself. He (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We are blind followers of the Book and the Sunnah and the righteous predecessors of this ummah, as well as what is relied on from the opinions of the four Imaams: Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan bin Thaabit, Maalik bin Anas, Muhammad bin Idrees and Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you hear that I have issued a ruling on something that does not conform with the unanimous agreement of the scholars, then reject my opinion.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you claim that the scholars are upon something different than what I am upon, then here are their books present.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I challenge the follower of Abu Haneefah with the opinions of the old Hanafee scholars and also the followers of Maalik, Shaafi’ee and Hanbal with the opinions of the previous scholars of each madh-hab, who are relied upon.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In summary, the thing that I forbid is when one believes that someone other than Allaah can do things that it is not possible for anyone to do except Allaah. So if I said something to this effect from myself, then accuse me of that, or in a book you find, which doesn’t adhere to this, then accuse me with that also. Or if I quoted it from the people of my madh-hab, then accuse me of that. But if I stated it based on the Command of Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and based on what the scholars in every madh-hab have unanimously agreed on, then it is not appropriate for a person who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to reject it due to the people of his time or the people of his country or because most of the people in his time reject it.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this discussion, we present two pieces of advice from the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: For those who strive against this da’wah and its followers, conspiring against it and attaching all kinds of accusations and falsehoods to it, the Shaikh says to these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I remind those who oppose me that the obligation upon the people is to follow what the Prophet counseled his ummah with (i.e. the Sunnah). And I say to them: The books are with you. Look in them and do not take any of my speech. However, when you come to know the words of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that are in your books then follow it even though most of the people oppose it…Do not (unconditionally) obey me or anyone else except for the command of Allaah’s Messenger, which is found in your books. And know that nothing can save you except for following Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). This worldly life is temporary and it is not proper for someone with common sense to be forgetful about Paradise and Hell.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/89-90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I call those who oppose me to four things: Either the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger or to the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of the scholars. And if he refuses this then I call him to a mubaahalah.” [2] [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: To those who are confused about this matter, the Shaikh says: “You must constantly supplicate to Allaah and humble yourself before Him, especially during the times in which the invocations are answered, such as: the last part of the night, the last portion of the prayer and after the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also use the supplications reported in the texts, especially the one that has been reported in the Saheeh, that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would say: ‘O Allaah, Lord of Jibraa’eel, Mikaa’eel and Israa’eel, Originator of the heavens and the earth, All-Knower of the Hidden and the Apparent, You will judge between Your servants in those matters which they differed on. Guide me in that which is differed on from the truth, by Your Will. Verily, You guide whom You will to a Straight Path.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must be persistent in saying this supplication before the One who answers the call of the distressed when he calls, and the One who guided Ibraaheem to oppose all of the people. And say: ‘O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you find difficulty in opposing the people, then reflect on Allaah’s statement: ‘Then we placed you upon a Legislation from Our Command, so follow it, and do not follow the vain desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing before Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allaah’s Path.’ [Surah Al-An’aam: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And reflect on the Prophet’s words found in the Saheeh: ‘Islaam began strange and it will return to being strange as it began’ and his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement: ‘Verily Allaah will not snatch away knowledge…’ and his statement: ‘Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khaleefahs who come after me’ and his statement: ‘And beware of newly invented matters, for indeed every innovation is a misguidance.’” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/42-43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if it becomes clear to you that this is the truth in which there is no doubt, and that it is an obligation to spread it amongst the people and to teach it to the women and men, then may Allaah have mercy on the one fulfills his duty, repents to Allaah and acknowledges this to himself, for indeed a person who repents from a sin is like one who has no sin at all. May Allaah guide us and you and our brothers to that which He loves and is pleased with, and peace be on you.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 2/43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His peace and blessings on His slave and messenger, our prophet and loved one, Muhammad, as well as His family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Tajseem comes from the word jism (body), and it literally means to make something into a body. This is the term applied when someone gives anthropomorphic (i.e. human-like) qualities to Allaah, by saying His hand is like my hand, and His seeing is like my seeing, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: A Mubaahalah is when two people who are in opposition to one another come together to invoke Allaah’s curses on the one who is lying and upon falsehood between the two disputants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the &#8216;Islamic terror&#8217; are endless. From the times in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80&#8217;s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who&#8217;s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can&#8217;t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur&#8217;an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word &#8216;salama&#8217; which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jihad </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a &#8216;holy war&#8217;, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic&#8221; [3]. </i>In the Qur&#8217;an, Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; &#8216;Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; &#8216;Make not mischief on the Earth&#8217;, they say; &#8216;We are only peace makers&#8217;. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <i>&#8220;forbade the killing of women and children</i>&#8221; [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading such passages from the Qur&#8217;an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah&#8217;s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Those who go to extremes are destroyed&#8221; </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam&#8217;s glorious law. However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up&#8221;</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli&#8217;s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell&#8221; </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He is a dweller of the Fire&#8221;. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire&#8221; </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>&#8230;If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Media</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi&#8217;ite suicide bombers of the 80&#8217;s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi&#8217;ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, &#8216;The Today&#8217; [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>&#8220;In The Name of Islam&#8221; </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? &#8230; no. The way forward? &#8230; yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1 </b>By using the many cases of child abuse and homosexuality by priests, Such a generalisation about Christianity could be made<br />
<b>2 </b>By using the incident of the destruction of the Babri mosque in Ayodya, India in December 1992 by Hindu zealots, such generalisations could be made about Hinduism<br />
<b>3 </b>Authentic &#8211; Reported by At-Tabaranee<br />
<b>4 </b>Years of sexual liaison with a White House aide, Monica Lewinski, has been proved against Mr Clinton.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Reply given by Ibn Baz to written questions posed by a Shaykh from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my esteemed brother, may Allah guide you to useful knowledge and to act upon it! Amen. Peace be upon you! I have received your letter dated 2/3/1394 A.H. May Allah guide you and grant you success! It included three questions about Wahhabism. Following is my answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>You asked about Wahhabism and whether it is a fifth Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) or follows one of the four Madh-habs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The term Wahhabism is used by many people to refer to the call initiated by Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab ibn Sulayman Al-Tamimy Al-Hanbaly (may Allah be merciful to him). He is called along with his followers &#8216;Wahhabis&#8217;. Every knowledgeable person must have heard about Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Wahhab&#8217;s movement (may Allah be merciful to him). He called for pure Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and warned people against all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as supplicating to the dead, trees, rocks or the like. He (may Allah be merciful to him) followed in creedal matters the Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) while in subsidiary matters he followed the Madh-hab of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal Al-Shaybany (may Allah be merciful to him). This is clear in the books and Fatwas (legal opinions) of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab and in the books of his followers and offspring which are published. Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab appeared at a time when Islam was alienated, the Arabian Peninsula and other areas were engulfed in ignorance and worshiping idols was widespread. So the Shaykh took it upon himself to strive and struggle, and devoted himself to destroying all means of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He employed all the possible ways leading to the spread of Tawhid free from any kind of superstition. Allah, out of His Bounty, made Imam Muhammad ibn Su`ud, Prince of Al-Dir‘iyyah at that time, accept the call. Thus, the Prince, his sons, those under his authority and his followers supported the Imam, may Allah reward them, forgive them and grant their offspring success to all that pleases Him and to what sets right the affairs of His Servants! All regions of the Arabian Peninsula have lived under this righteous call to the present day. Thus, Imam Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab’s call was in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Wahhabism is not a fifth Madh-hab as some ignorant and prejudiced people claim; rather, it is a call to the ‘Aqidah (creed) of Salafiyyah (those following the way of the righteous predecessors) and a way of reviving the main aspects of Islam and Tawhid which was forgotten in the Arabian Peninsula.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the criticisms leveled at Islam by demented animal rights activists, is that it encourages the wide scale slaughter of animals. Every year after the annual Hajj (pilgrimage) Muslims worldwide sacrifice an animal for the pleasure of Allaah. Not only is this a religious duty benefiting the doer, but it also helps many starving people around the world, to whom the meat is sent to. This however, is blurred from the minds of the insane.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Animal Tragic” &#8211; Islam And The Treatment Of Animals</strong></span><br />
Source: Invitation To Islam Newsletter, vol.1 issue.6, July 1999</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chained up bears in Russian circuses. A terrified fox running from the blood hounds. The Spanish bull being tormented in the arena with darts and knives. Elephant graveyards littered across India and Africa, courtesy of ivory hunters. Thousands of rare animals vanishing due to the deforestation of Central and Southern America. All these are examples of the tragic state of the creatures which live alongside us on this planet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, to be an animal in today’s world is not an easy life. Injustice against animals occurs in all of today’s societies. Living in the West, we hear many tales of cruelty towards animals in the ‘third’ world. The cruel cock fighting of South East Asia, the ‘barbaric’ animal delicacies of the Orient and the international smuggling of rare animals, are just some of the tales we hear. However, people in the West seem to forget that cruelty also goes on under their own noses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every year the cosmetics industry kills millions of animals for testing, just to appease the vain desires of people. Cattle and livestock are transported between the ‘civilised’ nations of Europe in the most horrendous conditions. And animals are brought to the verge of extinction just so that people can revel in the latest trends of jewellery and fashion. Indeed, to be an animal in today’s world is not as easy life!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the solution to this cruelty? Do we all join the RSPCA and WWF? 1 Do we jump onto the bandwagon with the crazy animal rights groups and start bombing campaigns? No, clearly not, as such measures have eased the cruelty animals very little. So what do we do? The answer is simple, and has been available to the people of the world for the past 1400 years. It is none other than Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and Animals – The Americans send a monkey into space and the Russians a dog. TV programmes about injured animals are aired daily. Cruelty to pets results in massive fines and imprisonment. Such actions by the non- Muslims are seen as liberating forces which have only come into existence this century. However, unknown to many, Islam endorsed this kindness to animals 1400 years earlier. It is Islam which first taught the world about compassion and Mercy to animals. The Qur’an and the Sunnah (way) of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), give us guidance in all affairs. By worshiping Allaah through these sources, the treatment of animals is exemplified more than any other way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam teaches us that the creatures of the earth are from the signs of Allaah, by which we can recognize His Greatness. They are all here for a specific purpose which Allaah has ordained for them. From the tiniest ant to the largest Blue Whale, each animal on this earth provides a service by which life carries on uninterrupted. As Muslims, we see these creatures as an opportunity to reflect and ponder about the perfect artistry of Allaah. An example are the birds in the sky as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is the All-Seer of everything.” [Surah al-Mulk (67):19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These creatures offer us so much by way of their services. They are our food, our clothing, our livelihoods and our transportation across the land. All this they do for us at no cost or charge. As Muslims we have to therefore be grateful to Allaah for this magnificent blessing, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Thus We have made them (animals) subject to you that you may be grateful.” [Surah Al-Hajj (22):36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gratitude to Allaah comes in the form of kindness towards these animals. Such is the mercy of Islam, that it produces this kindness through the expectation of Allaah’s reward, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: “….there is a reward for kindness to every living thing” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way Muslims see kind treatment of animals as a religious deed to please Allaah. To mistreat animals is thus disobedience to Allaah – something which we will be held accountable for, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) demonstrated when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A woman (from the previous nations) was tormented because of a cat which she had confined and staved till it died. She did not allow it to eat or drink while it was confined, nor did she set it free so that it may eat the insects of the earth. As a result of her wickedness she was condemned to Hell.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People abuse and torture animals because they think that no one will hold them accountable. Once people accept that Allaah will hold us all to account, can such cruelty stop. By studying the beliefs and practising the injunctions of Islam, cruelty to animals can truly stop. Looking at the example of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) we can see exactly how animals should be treated. Thus, from the actions and saying of this amazing man, can so much be learned in this oppressive and unjust world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way of Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) – Once, during the early part of the day, the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) passed by a withered camel kneeling down near the gate of the mosque. At the end of the day he passed by the mosque again only to see the camel in the same state as before. When the owner of the camel was looked for but could not be found, he (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said to the people:<br />
“Fear Allaah regarding these dumb animals and ride them with care and feed them with care.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last Messenger to humanity also said:<br />
“Ride these animals peacefully, and when you are not in need of them keep them peacefully, and do not take them as chairs.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lot of the animal in light of these sayings is exonerated beyond anything that the liberation movements of the West have produced. This is because the sayings of this man are not from is own desire, rather:<br />
“….it is (only) the revelation with which he is inspired”[Surah An-Najm 53:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Beware of taking the backs of your animals as pulpits, for indeed Allaah, the Most High, has subjugated them for you to carry you to a land with great difficulty….” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the wisdom of these words O’ reader. Is this not an appreciation of the creatures which inhabit our planet? Whilst the rest of the world was steeped in savagery, here was this amazing man, 1400 years ago, improving the situation for every being on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, while entering an enclosure, the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saw a camel. When the camel saw the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) it began to cry. So the Prophet went to it, wiped its back around its hump and rubbed it until it calmed down. Then addressing the owner of the camel, he (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: “Will you not fear Allaah in regards to these animals which Allaah has placed under your control? For indeed it (the camel) has complained to me that you keep it hungry and fatigued.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The leader of a nation and a man to be followed by millions, is seen here comforting a creature which cannot even talk. Such behaviour has made the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) the most influential man ever to exist. One does not hear of Confucious, Caeser, Napoleon, Hitler or any other famous leader ever expressing such mercy and compassion towards the creation. Even today, when leaders broadcast their own virtues to gain support, we find that they cannot even stop the cruelty which goes on in their countries. The widespread abuse of riding beasts (camels, elephants, horses, mules etc.) in circuses is one such example. The case of Mary Chipperfield, a circus trainer who was caught on camera beating elephants – only for her to be given them back – shows us how much the people truly need Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The killing of animals for the sake of sport and fun is something totally outlawed by the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and Islam. He (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Do not take any living thing as a target.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, such is the severity of this, that Ibn Umar (a companion of the Prophet) said:<br />
“Indeed the Messenger of Allaah cursed the one who made a living thing a target.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, big game safaris, bull fighting and fox hunting are all acts which were condemned by Islam even before they were invented by the Europeans. If pain has to be inflicted, such as for identifying purposes, then the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<br />
“….Prohibited striking animals in their faces or branding them on their faces.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The international smuggling of rare tropical birds and the theft of their eggs is something well highlighted. The motive to make profit from the suffering of some of the most beautiful creatures on earth, is a good reason for many. With Islam however, such a reason is not valid. Once the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was on a journey with his companions. Some of his companions saw a nest with a bird and its two chicks. They took the chicks from the nest which made the bird swivel around in anxiety. When the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saw this he said:<br />
“Who has caused distress to her regarding her children? Return her children to her”. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kindness is even extended to those animals which Islam normally bars participation with, such as dogs. [12] The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) informed us about a man from the previous nations who had seen a thirsty dog panting and eating mud. The man climbed into a well, filled his shoe with water and gave it to the dog. Because of this “….Allaah thanked and forgave him.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) also said:<br />
“Allaah forgave a prostitute (from the Israelites) who tied her shoe to her scarf and drew out some water (from a well) for a dog which she saw dying of thirst…..” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kind treatment of animals is topped up by the practical help which Islam advises with. The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Any Muslim who plants a tree gains the reward of giving in charity. What is eaten from it is charity, what is stolen from it, what the animals eat and what the birds eat is all charity….” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only do these words encourage us to preserve the environment, but they also help us to provide a welcome sustenance to the animals around us. Developing from this, the Muslim will increase obedience to Allaah by leaving out bread and biscuits for the birds that visit the garden, or nuts for the squirrels who rummage around. Having heard these narrations about the last Messenger, only the unjust would say that Islam does not truly emancipate animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extremes – Cruelty to animals is one extreme regarding the beasts of the earth. On the other side of the spectrum we find that the lot of the animal is increased so much, that it has even superseded that of humanity. In today’s world people love and honour animals so much that they literally worship them! What could be more typical of this then the religion of Hinduism. Cows, monkeys, snakes, elephants and rats are among the many animals worshipped by Hindus. By going to this extreme of worshipping and loving animals, the lives of humans are usually forgotten and put in danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A perfect example is the huge outbreak of plague in Calcutta, India, a few years ago. According to Hindu mythology, Ganesh the elephant headed deity, who is called upon to remove obstacles, used to ride upon a rat! Because of this the rat is considered sacred and thus the city could not be sectioned off. Such insane polytheistic behaviour resulted in this plague spreading and killing many people. Such is the deification of the rat in Hinduism, that in India special temples are dedicated for rats. In these temples Hindus live and eat with rats. Once the rats finish drinking milk provided for them, that which is left over is drunk by Hindus who consider the milk to have been blessed!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other religions such as Jainism 16 have gone to such extremes, that we find that their religious monks and nuns constantly wear mouth veils lest they should swallow even a fly by accident!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worship of animals is not just confined to organised religion. In the West, many pet owners are also guilty of this. The extent to which people love their pets has escalated beyond control. Every year millions are spent on pampering pets. If all the money from the beauty pageants for cats and dogs was sent to the starving millions around the world, so much human life could be saved. But no… the eccentric vices of the West deem that animal life is far precious then human life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Islam, humans undoubtedly come first. The destruction of human life for the sake of animals is epitomised by the animal rights groups who are so fervent in the West. Activities of groups such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) clearly show how human life is so undervalued. By vandalising and destroying laboratories, such groups believe that they are liberating the poor animals who are tested therein. [17] However the human cost of such actions is ignored. By testing animals for medical research, remedies for cancer, Alzheimer’s, and many other degenerative illnesses are being developed. Such testing is very beneficial for humanity and has brought relief to many through the new drugs developed. Thus, in destroying incubators, computers and other valuable equipment, more people are kept in pain then animals. Letter bombs, car bombs, assassinations and throwing acid at scientists, are just some of the horrors which these terrorists have unleashed upon society. Every year innocent people get killed because of the love which these lunatics have for animals. Such people have clearly gone to extremes with the creatures of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Slaughter</strong></span> – One of the criticisms levelled at Islam by demented animal rights activists, is that it encourages the wide scale slaughter of animals. Every year after the annual Hajj (pilgrimage) Muslims worldwide sacrifice an animal for the pleasure of Allaah. Not only is this a religious duty benefiting the doer, but it also helps many starving people around the world, to whom the meat is sent to. This however, is blurred from the minds of the insane. In countries such as Britain and France, protests against this are vigorous. In France such protests have been intensified with the support of people like Bridgett Bardot, the famous ‘sexkitten’ of French cinema. 18 If only these people were to examine the way of the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), would they realise that even in the slaughter of animals Islam has regulated compassion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic method of slaughtering is one which embodies true mercy. To have mercy whilst slaughtering will bring mercy from Allaah, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Whosoever has mercy, even if he is slaughtering a sparrow, Allaah will have mercy upon him on the day of resurrection.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the method of slaughtering with a knife (at the wind pipe) is far painless then the electric shocks or crushing bows to the head which are administered in the West. The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Allaah has enjoined goodness to everything.. when you slaughter, slaughter in a good way. Let every one of you sharpen his knife and let the slaughtered animal die comfortably.” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By using a sharp knife to slaughter, the pain is minimised and the animal dies very quickly. Such is the mercy of Islam, that it even forbids that a knife be sharpened in front of the slaughtered animal, lest it would feel terror and anxiety. Once the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) passed by a man who had his foot on the neck of a sheep. Whilst he was sharpening his blade, the sheep was looking towards it. The Prophet of Mercy (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said to him:<br />
“Do you intend to give it two deaths? Why did you not sharpen your knife before you laid it on the ground?” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This compassionate behaviour of the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was understood and implemented in the best way by his noble companions. Thus, we find that Umar, the second righteous caliph of Islam, once hit a man with a stick because he sharpened his blade in front of a sheep. Another time, Umar saw a man dragging a sheep to slaughter it. Umar hit him with a stick [22] and said:<br />
“Drive it – may your mother be bereaved of you – to its death in a nice way.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading this, who can say that Islam encourages wide scale slaughter? Surely those who criticise Islam after knowing how merciful it is towards animals, do so from desire. Animals have been created for our use and provision; yet such is the beauty of Islam, that it has set a standard for use and provision which is truly humane. There is no other way which is so balanced in its treatment of the animals of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From cruelty to craziness, the extremes regarding animals are astounding. These extremes show how ignorant people are of their purpose in life. Once people realise that Allaah deserves to be worshipped alone, will everything else fall into place. Our actions on this earth stem from whether or not we worship Allaah correctly. Those who worship Allaah correctly are those who treat the animals of the earth correctly. Those who worship other than Allaah, are those who go to extremes with animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The world is beautiful and green and Allaah &#8211; be He exalted – has made you governors over it to see how you will act” 24 said Muhammad the last Messenger of Allaah. By worshipping Allaah as guided by Islam, we can act correctly with the animals, the plants and all that is in the beautiful and green world of ours. May Allaah help us to show compassion to all the creatures which He has created. Ameen</p>

An example is the release of 2000 minks from a mink farm last year in the UK by activists. Starving and desperate, the minks turned from harmless creatures into ferocious beasts rampaging the English countryside on the lookout for food &#8211; even if it was human!<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>We always hear the Hadith:</strong><strong> Women are lacking in their capacity to reason and in deen i.e. religion. </strong>Some people even use it to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">offend</span> women. Could you kindly explain the meaning of this Hadith? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by shaykh ibn baz rahimahullah: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith reads:<a rel="nofollow"> &#8220;I have not seen anyone more deficient in ability to reason and deen than you. A cautious sensible man can be led astray by some of you.” It was said: “O Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him)! What is the deficiency in our reasoning and deen?” He said: “Is not the testimony of two women equal to the witness of one man?” It was said: &#8220;What is deficient in her deen?&#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;Is not it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?” </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained that the deficiency in woman&#8217;s reasoning means their weak memory. Therefore, their testimony must be verified and supported by another woman to confirm their testimony, because they may forget and thus add or omit some of the testimony. Allah (He may be Praised) states:Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 282<a rel="nofollow"> And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the deficiency of their deen, it means they abandon Salah and Sawm (fasting) during their menses and post-partum period. They are not commanded to repeat Salah (prayer). This is the meaning of their being lacking in deen. They will not be called to account for this shortcoming, because it is the will of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who legislated this for their comfort. If they were to observe Sawm during their menses and post-partum period, it would be difficult for them. Therefore, Allah commands them to abandon Sawm during their menses and post-partum period, and make up for it later. As for Salah, there is something which prevents them from ceremonial purity. Therefore, it is out of the Mercy of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) that He commands them to abandon Salah during their menses and post-partum period. However, they are commanded not to compensate for Salah because there is great hardship in this, as Salah is repeated five times a day  and night, and menses may last for many days; seven, eight or more and post-partum may last for forty days. So, it was of Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Benevolence not to hold them accountable for Salah or oblige them to make up for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This does not mean that the lack of their deficiency to reason and deen extends to every aspect of life. The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained that the lack of their ability to reason is because of their weak memory when giving testimony, and the shortcoming in their worship is because they abandon Salah and Sawm during their menses and post-partum period. This does not mean that they are lower in rank than men in all things, or men are better than them in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally speaking, males excel females for many reasons. Allah states:Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 34<a rel="nofollow"> Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, some women may excel men. There are many women whose reason is better than men, and are stronger in deen and memorization. The report of the Prophet (peace be upon him) only indicates that the male gender is generally better in reasoning and deen than the female gender in the two aspects specified by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women may perform more righteous deeds than men, their piety may be more than men, and thus their rank in the Hereafter may be better than the rank of men. They may focus on some matters and memorize them better than men. They exert effort in memorization and focus, so they established a reference in Islamic history as well as other things which are clear to those who consider the conditions of women during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and later. It is now evident that this deficiency does not mean that we cannot rely on her in narration or testimony, if she is supported by another woman. Anyway, this report does not prevent her from being of the best servants of Allah  if they perform righteous deeds; although Sawm is overlooked during their menses and post-partum, and even if they are exempt from performing Salah. This does not mean that they are lower in everything. Men and women are equally required to observe the standards of piety, good actions, and careful performance of things in their charge. This specific lack of reason and deen is limited to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained. <strong>So, a Muslim must not offend women by attributing deficiency to them in everything, but it is a flaw in their worship and weakness in reasoning with regard to accuracy of testimony. Thus, the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) should be properly understood. Allah knows the best.</strong></p>
