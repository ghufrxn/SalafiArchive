<p>When the Hearts Are Not Filled With the Love of Allah &#8211; Shaykh Saleh Ale ash Shaykh حفظه الله [Video|En subtitles] &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEyqTpu3ho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEyqTpu3ho</a> [1:32 min]<br /><br />Shortcomings in worship, the absence of humility and submission, committing evil actions, falling into the impermissible, and falling short in the obligations only occur when the love of Allah is not filled in the hearts.</p>



<p>And when He is not exalted with the utmost exaltation and He is not feared.</p>



<p>The more the individual contemplates and looks, the more he will know the signs that show that Allah alone is the Lord and He is the One administering, meaning, that which is included in Tawhid al-Rububiyyah- and that everything is in His Hands.</p>



<p>The more these hearts are filled and are submissive and humbled, even if all of mankind plotted, they wouldn&#8217;t pay any attention to it.</p>



<p>The absence of giving importance to the understanding of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah leads to weakness in the hearts towards the people and weakness in the hearts in holding fast to the religion.</p>



<p>And one&#8217;s submission will be weak because he doesn&#8217;t exalt Allah and he doesn&#8217;t see the marvelous creation of Allah in everything.</p>



<p>And the individual said well when he said: And in everything has a sign that shows that He is One.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Fatwa No. 8377</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I would like to raise an issue that caused a dispute between some people. It is the writing of the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the word &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; in an interlacing shape on top of the door of one of the Masjids (mosques) in Adlab. Some of them said that it is not permissible to write these names in such a shape. The proof they mentioned to support their viewpoint was that in this way, Muhammad&#8217;s status (peace be upon him), would be the same as Allah&#8217;s which is not reasonable. Others said that writing them in such a way is permissible as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) places His name beside the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). I would like you to guide me to what is right. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans. by Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;, KSA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law) texts join between testifying that no one is worthy of worship except Allah and testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah in certain places, such as in Adhan (call to Prayer), Iqamah (call to start the Prayer), in the Hadith: Islam is based on five pillars: (Testifying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah&#8230;) and other places. These texts point out what Mukallafun (legally competent persons) should believe in with regard to Allah and the Messenger, such as saying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But mixing the two words in writing was not mentioned in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah </strong>(whatever is reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, mixing both words in writing contains great danger as this is similar to the false creed of the Christians with regard to the trinity. They believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It also contains an element of the false creed of pantheism, and leads to elevating the Prophet </strong>(peace be upon him)<strong> and worshipping him along with Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is prohibited to write the Name of Allah and the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) by mixing the letters of the two words together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is also <strong>prohibited to write the words (Allah &#8211; Muhammad) next to each other</strong> on the top of the door of the Masjids or any other place because doing so may contain some delusion and misguidance with regard to the prohibitions mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are repeated questions about some who claim that Allah is incarnate among His creation and mingles with them. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">They claim that</span> </strong>this is the meaning of the general Ma`iyyah (association or being with). They take as evidence the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> were not on the western side</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (of the Mount)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong> and:  &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span>; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">nor were you with them when they disputed&#8221;</span></strong>. They claim that the two Ayahs denote that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) was not with them, but Allah was there in His Self ­Entity, as he exists everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since those people misunderstand the whole point and made a big mistake, opposing the true `Aqidah (creed) as shown in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the Muslim nation, I think I should show the right opinion on such a false belief and what seems to be confusing about this point pertaining to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted and Glorified) can be described only with the Names and Attributes with which He has described Himself and the Names and Attributes with which His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Him, which suit His Majesty without Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All­ Hearer, the All­ Seer&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As stated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and unanimously agreed upon by the Salaf of the Muslim nation, Allah (Glorified be He) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty, unlike the seating of His creation. Allah (Exalted be He) is among His creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed about them from Him. This is what has been proven by the Holy Qur&#8217;an with its rhetoric Ayahs and by the Prophetic Sunnah with its direct authentic Hadiths.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There are many Qur&#8217;anic proofs</strong></span> that Allah exists in the heavens above His creatures and is seated on His Throne. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">To Him ascend </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(all)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds) ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will take you and raise you to Myself ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The angels and the Rûh</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [Jibrîl (Gabriel)]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> ascend to Him ; </span></strong></p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the proofs from the Prophetic Sunnah</span></strong>, there are uncountable numbers of Sahih (authentic) and Hasan (good) Hadiths, such as: the Hadith about the Prophet&#8217;s Mi`raj (Ascension to the heavens) to his Lord and the Hadith about the Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) which was reported by Abu Dawud and others: &#8220;<strong>Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven; Holy is Your Name, Your command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadith about the mountain goats, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>..and the Throne is above this; Allah is above the Throne; and He knows your states</strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span>. (Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an authentic Hadith he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said to the bonds woman: &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;In the heaven.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) asked her: &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;You are the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Then he (peace be upon him) said to her master: &#8220;Release her for she is a believer.&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Hadiths that were authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) stating that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said that Allah is above His Throne and that He is above the heavens, as naturally known by all nations, Arabs and non­-Arabs both in the pre­Islamic period and under Islam, except those whom Satan has allured. Also, there are hundreds or thousands of statements by the Salaf on the same topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing in the Holy Qur&#8217;an, the Prophetic Sunnah or the statements of the Salaf, neither from among the Prophet&#8217;s Companions nor those who followed their guidance or the Imams who lived in the age of allurement and difference, that opposes what has been mentioned above whether explicitly or implicitly. None of them ever said that Allah is not above the heavens, not above the Throne, not exist anywhere in His Self ­Entity, all places are the same to Him, or not exist in the world nor outside it, not permissible to use your fingers, etc. to point at Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrarily, it was authentically reported in the Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah that on concluding a famous sermon by Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) on the Day of `Arafat in the biggest gathering attended by Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), he said: &#8220;<strong>Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you, haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you</strong>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then He (peace be upon him) raised his finger to the sky and pointed at the people and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>O Allah! Bear witness to this</strong>.&#8221; There are many similar Hadiths on this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also discussed by Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and others who were well ­versed in such matters (see Al ­Fatawa, v., p. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, the corrupt belief adopted by the impairing <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Jahmiyyah</span> </strong>(a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) and those following them from among the people who introduced innovations to the religion is one of the most wicked and harmful beliefs. It detracts from Allah&#8217;s Majesty ­ we seek refuge in Allah from our hearts&#8217; deviation from the right path! There are many pieces of evidence of such misleading and corrupt beliefs. There can be no doubt that a sound mind and upright natural disposition deny such corrupt beliefs. Besides, there is hard legal evidence that denies such corrupt beliefs. Regarding the practice of taking the above ­mentioned Ayahs as evidence to support their corrupt belief, it is a wicked practice, as they claim that Allah was incarnate in the earth beside Mount Sinai, taking as evidence the Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs on such an event. May Allah be Glorified and High from their grave falsehood!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those claiming Allah is incarnate among His creation do not know that Ma`iyyah is of two types; general and private.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>private Ma`iyyah</strong></span> are the Ayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)&#8221;</strong></span>. See the footenote of V.9:120). ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us&#8221;</span></strong>. and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am with you both, hearing and seeing&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are similar Ayahs on the private Ma`iyyah that Allah (Exalted be He) is with His prophets and pious believing servants through support, help, guidance and care. This is confirmed by Allah (Glorified be He) in a Qudsi Hadith related by His Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) until I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears; his sense of sight with which he sees; his hand with which he grips; and his leg with which he walks&#8221;</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not mean that Allah becomes a servant&#8217;s extremities ­ may Allah be Glorified and High from such meaning! Conversely, it denotes that Allah becomes with a servant through support and guidance, as explained in another narration of the Qudsi Hadith mentioned above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With Me he hears, with Me he sees, with Me he grips, and with Me he walks</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the second narration Allah explains the meaning of His saying, &#8220;<strong>I become his sense of hearing, etc.<span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong>&#8221; which implies Allah&#8217;s guidance to and support of His servants and protecting them from committing what displeases Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#993300;">general Ma`iyyah</span></strong>, it means perfect knowledge. Such a type of Ma`iyyah is mentioned in many Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(secret counsel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of three but He is their fourth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of five but He is their sixth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of less than that or more but He is with them </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is with you (</strong>by His Knowledge)<strong> wheresoever you may be&#8221;</strong></span>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">their whole story) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">with knowledge, and indeed We have not been absent</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Neither you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur’ân, ­ nor you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(mankind)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(good or evil)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing i</span></strong>t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many similar Ayahs on such a type of Ma`iyyah. Allah (Glorified be He) is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Perfection and Majesty. Also, He is All ­Knowing of His creation and a Witness over them wherever they exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, at their homes or in the open desert. All are equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge, as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge and they all are under His Sight and Hearing that He hears their speech, sees them wherever they are, and knows their secrets and private counsel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah (Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> It is the same </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(to Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(His)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Knowledge. There is no god or lord but Allah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) begins the Ayahs on general Ma`iyyah with knowledge and finishes them with knowledge so that His servants may know that Allah is All ­Knowing of their affairs, not that He is incarnate among them in their dwellings, etc. Allah is Exalted above such falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The falsehood that the general Ma`iyyah means that Allah is incarnate among His creation is adopted by those believing in incarnation</span>. They claim that Allah exists everywhere in His Self­ Entity and that He is Exalted above being seated on His Throne and existing in the heavens over His creation. They never exalt Him above being existent in the dirtiest places ­may Allah disgrace them all!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Great scholars from among the Salaf fought such falsehoods such as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, `Abdullah Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ishaq Ibn Rahawayh, Abu Hanifah Al­Nu`man and others. Similarly, scholars from among the Imams of Guidance did the same such as Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim, Al­ Hafiz Ibn Kathir and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this point has been clear, the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge)</span></strong> and similar Ayahs do not denote that Allah is incarnate among His creation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. The preposition &#8220;with&#8221; in these Ayahs does not mean this at all, but it only denotes Ma`iyyah and association. Such Ma`iyyah has a different meaning in each situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As said by Abu `Umar Al­ Tallamanky (may Allah be merciful with him), Muslims from among Ahl­ul­Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) unanimously agree that the meaning of the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be</span></strong>. and similar Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs is that Allah is with His creation by His knowledge and that He, may He be Exalted, is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, great scholars and Imams from among the Salaf were of the opinion that Allah is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr Al­Sijzy said our great Imams, such as Sufyan Al­Thawriy, Malik, Hammad Ibn Salamah, Hammad Ibn Zayd, Sufyan Ibn `Uyaynah, Al­Fudayl, Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ahmad, and Ishaq unanimously agree that Allah (Glorified be He) is established on His Throne by His Self­ Entity and everywhere by His Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Umar Ibn `Abdul­Bar said: &#8220;Great scholars from among Sahabah (Prophet&#8217;s Companions) and Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) known for Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation) were of the opinion that the Ta&#8217;wil of the Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth</strong></span> (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) is that Allah is seated on His Throne above the heavens in His Self­ Entity and that He exists everywhere by His Knowledge. It is worth mentioning that no notable scholar opposed their opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al­ Hafizh Ibn Kathir (may Allah be Merciful with him) said, &#8220;The Ayah: &#8216;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by His Knowledge) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">wheresoever you may be. And Allâh is the All ­Seer of what you do&#8217;</span></strong>. means that Allah is a witness of our deeds wherever and whenever we exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, in our homes or in the open desert, as we are all equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge because He surrounds us all with His Knowledge. We are all under His Sight and Hearing that He hears our talk and sees us wherever we are, and knows our secrets and private counsels. Allay (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts</span></strong>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. There is no God or lord but Him</span></strong>. Regarding the Tafsir (explanation) of the Ayah quoted from Surah Al­Mujadalah in which Allah says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three he said that there are no three persons with a secret but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. that He is All­Knowing of their affairs, hearing their talk and knowing their secrets and private counsels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah&#8217;s messengers write down people&#8217;s private counsels though Allah is All­ Knowing of such private counsels and hears them. Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Know they not that Allâh knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allâh is the All­ Knower of things unseen&#8221;</strong></span>. and: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record&#8221;</span></strong>. As said, many scholars reported consensus over the meaning of this Ayah is that Allah exists among His creation by His Knowledge. There can be no doubt with regard to this point. In addition, His hearing as well as His Knowledge encompasses them. Moreover, they are under His Sight, as He (Exalted be He) is All­ Knowing of the affairs of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There can be no doubt that the statements of the Salaf about such a point are too many to be counted. Therefore, the belief that Allah is incarnate among His creation, the claim that Allah exists among His creation in His Self­ Entity according to the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">by His Knowledge)</span> and that it is not permissible to point at Him are totally wrong and false as shown from the many direct proofs mentioned here and the consensus of Muslim scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it becomes clear that those who say that Allah is incarnate among His creation and those who follow them are not right at all. Rather, they ascribe to Allah what does not suit His Majesty. In addition, they give the Ayahs on Ma`iyyah explanations that are different from those given by great scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah protect us from disgrace and from ascribing to Allah that which does not suit Him, out of ignorance! We ask Allah (Glorified be He) to make us adhere to the right path, as only He is Able to do all things! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>37- Merits of learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner from Hadhramaut is asking about &#8216;Aqidah (creed): Your Eminence, is learning the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Wajib (obligatory) or Mustahab (desirable)? Does learning these Attributes make any difference? What is the ruling on those who believe that it is not Wajib to learn the Attributes because this might entangle one into asking why and what? What are the books you recommend in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes from the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is <strong>one of the best acts of worship that brings us nearer to Allah</strong>. Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes <strong>helps one to glorify, praise and call on Allah by His Names and Attributes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that we should know Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and use them while calling on Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has ninety-nine Names; anyone who learns them will be admitted to Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith indicates that Allah is Witr (&#8216;Odd&#8217;, i.e. He is one) and He loves odd numbers.  It also indicates that scholars and believers should learn the Names and Attributes of Allah to invoke and praise Him and act upon them so that they enter Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should know that to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) belongs all Magnificent Names and that He has no peer, equal or rival. He is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds and none is comparable to Him. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></strong>.) None of Allah&#8217;s Attributes such as His Mercy, Highness, Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Wrath , Laughter etc, is similar to ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">As for the books we recommend in this regard,</span> </strong>the Noble Qur&#8217;an is the greatest Book. We advise you and all Muslims to adhere to it and recite it frequently because it is the Book of Allah which contains light and guidance. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur&#8217;ân guides to that which is most just and right</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(This is) a Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which we have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?)&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise all Muslims to frequently recite, ponder over, and memorize the entire Qur&#8217;an or parts thereof. It is the Book of Allah and the source of light and guidance. It calls for adopting good morals, performing righteous deeds, following that which Allah has enjoined, and avoiding that which He has forbidden. It contains the stories of the prophets, messengers, and the righteous so that people may follow in their footsteps and the stories of the wrongdoers, so people may avoid their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also recommend those who are versed to read the books of Hadith such as the Two Sahihs (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) and the four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) books (of Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we recommend novices to read the abridged versions of these books which can be easily memorized, such as, Bulugh Al-Maram by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Kitab Al-Tawhid, Thalathat Al-Usul, Al Qawa&#8217;id Al &#8216;Arba&#8217;, and Kashf Al-Shubuhat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him), Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasatiyyah by Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, and Umdat Al-Hadith by Shaykh Al-Hafidh Abdul Ghani Al-Maqdisi. These are some important books which should be read and studied because they are useful.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.</strong></span>&#8221; [Surah Kahf 18:109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>[Tafseer Ibn Kathir]</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Words of the Lord can never be finished</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: `<strong>Say, O Muhammad, if the water of the sea were ink for a pen to write down the words, wisdom and signs of Allah, the sea would run dry before it all could be written down.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(even if We brought like it)</strong> means, another sea, then another, and so on, additional seas to be used for writing. The Words of Allah would still never run out. As Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَامٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea </strong>(were ink)<strong>, with seven seas behind it to increase it, yet the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</strong></span>) (31:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, &#8220;<strong>The parable of the knowledge of all of mankind, in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, is that of a drop of water in comparison to all of the oceans</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished,</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says that even if those oceans were ink for the Words of Allah, and all the trees were pens, the pens would be broken and the water of the sea would run dry, and the Words of Allah would remain, for nothing can outlast them. For no one can comprehend the greatness of Allah or praise Him as He deserves to be praised, except the One Who praises Himself. Our Lord is as He says He is and He is beyond what we can say. The blessings of this world, the beginning and end of it, in comparison to the blessings of the Hereafter, are like a mustard seed compared to the entire world.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this episode <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio/audio-saleh-as-saleh"><strong>Dr. Saleh Al-Saleh</strong></a> <em>rahimahullaah</em> explained on the topic of <strong>&#8220;Who We Must Worship?&#8221;</strong> Human beings are in need to worship, but Who to worship? And What are his attributes? And how he will be worshiped? The lectures provide a good explanation to such hard questions.</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Some Excerpts from the Video:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The submission and obedience of man to His Creator is the essence of Islam. The Name “Islam” is chosen by God (Allaah) and not by man. It is the same message revealed to all the prophets and Messengers by Allaah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its final and universal form it was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم: may Allaah exalt his mention and save him and his message from all kinds of evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the identifying name or title of the Majestic, sole and True God. This noun which is the name of Allaah applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and Most High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name Allaah is the ma’looh (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing). He is the Creator: to Him belongs the Commandment. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Elijas, Malcom’s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Gurus, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too), Diana, light fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), Saints, Priests, Monks, Haile Selassie, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!! All are created beings or things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Allaah is not chosen by man and it is not named after a prophet, saint or any famous man. The name “Allaah” was referred to by all prophets including Adam, Jesus, Moses, and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as the One true God who deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate nature in man (fitrah) recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allaah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes nor does it relax towards associating human qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son”, and that “everyone is born with an original sin”. They “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material world”. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!” not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “origin god” of Rome: The god of desire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete code for life which requires man to fulfill the purpose for his presence on earth. Allaah does not want for man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men, desire, or sex. He provides the proofs that he is the One who can deliver man from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him. He is the Last, everything ends except Him; the Most High, nothing is above Him; the Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach and his compassing, and He is the Most High in His nearness. He is the Ever-Living, to Him we shall all return, where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not beget nor is He begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel (Injeel) as a message to the Children of Israel. A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him. A man who needs to eat, walk, sleep, rest, etc. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need, but Allaah, the God of Jesus, is far above any imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafarianism, etc., all are forms of worship to created beings/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a nationalistic belonging to Allaah: “The Tribal God” of Israel. Men and women following these religions were born with the natural inclination of worshipping their Creator, Allaah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. Once they are exposed to the Signs of Allaah around them, or in the Qur’an, or to someone who triggers their Fitrah (natural inclination to worship Allaah alone), the reverting process begins, and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many distortions of Islam in the media, worldwide. However, Despite the wrong practices of some Muslims (rulers and ruled) in some countries, those who seek the truth are judging Islam according to its doctrines. That is why we continue to witness a global growth in the number of people accepting this true religion of Allaah. The opposition to Islam will intensify with the spread of this truth in the world. This is not a conflict of “civilizations”, but rather the real struggle between the truths presented in the creed and principles of Islam and false doctrines and ways of worship. This is a real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allaah’s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breathe? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? So is it our right to ignore our Creator when we are all need of Him? Allaah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One and only one True God. It is the religion of submission to the Will and Commandment of the One Who brought us to life, the Ever Living who will never die. It is the complete way of life for all mankind. All these qualities are chosen by Allaah in His only religion: Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that you will come with an open heart to read the Noble Qur’aan, because none can expose the truth better than the Word of Allaah. The Qur’an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in Arabic and it is not authored by him for he was unlettered. The translations of its meanings into many languages are available in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may want to know how does one become a Muslim. In order to become a Muslim one must openly recite ash-shahaadah (the profession of faith): La ilaaha illallaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah which means that there is no true god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. This means that there is no god worthy of being worshipped but Allaah, and that He must be worshipped only according to the teaching of His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Those teachings are best understood by the Prophet’s companions, and those who rightfully follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. They are called as-salaf as-saalih (the Righteous Predecessors). May Allaah, the Most High, guide us all to this path.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لِمَن شَاءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَسْتَقِيمَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>For whoever wills among you to take the straight path </strong></span>(Surah al-Takwir Verse 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>For whoever wills</strong>&#8221; is connected to what came before it, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is only a reminder to the worlds, for whoever among you wills to take the straight path</span>&#8220;. As for those who choose not to take the straight path, they neither accept the reminder, nor do they gain any benefit from it. Allah says about those who do accept the reminder:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْر َ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>In that is surely a reminder for whoever has a heart or listens while he is heedful.</strong> </span>[Sūrah Qāf, 50:37]</p>
<p>For anyone who does not want to take this straight path, there is no way to benefit such a person with this Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Issue of Freewill:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: <strong>Do people actually have freewill to do as they choose?</strong> Yes, people have the freedom to choose as they will. Allah (عزّ وجل) has allowed each person the freedom of choice and freewill; if he wants, he does something, if not he does not do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this were not the case—if people had no freewill—then anyone to whom the messengers were sent would have an excuse against Allah to plead (because they disbelieved): “<strong>We had no choice in the matter</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So yes, people certainly have the freedom to act on their choices. Each individual knows that if he decides, for example, to visit Mecca, Medina, or some other place, it is by his choice. Anytime a person makes a choice, it is by his own decision. He neither feels others force his choice on him or force him to prefer one thing over another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if an individual chooses to obey Allah, it is by his own choice. And should someone choose to commit a sin, it is also by his own choice. So people do have freewill yet we know with total certainty that people will never “will,” or actually make something happen (including his own actions), unless Allah has willed it to happen before it happens. For this reason, after &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">For whoever wills among you to take the straight path</span>&#8221; Allah then clarifies: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And you do not will unless Allah wills</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not will for anything to happen unless Allah has already allowed it to happen. So when anything happens, we know Allah has obviously allowed it to take place. If Allah had not allowed it to happen, we could not have willed it to occur ourselves as Allah  (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَكِنِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ ۖ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If Allah had willed, those (generations) succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, so some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:253]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after we have done anything, we know we chose to do it based on our will and choice, but we also know that this occurred by the will of Allah (عزّ وجل), If he had not willed it, we would not have accomplished it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Now we come to another question:</strong></span> Based on the points above, we then have an excuse to commit sins because whatever happens, Allah allows it and has willed it. We say no, we have no justification for sinning because we have no way of knowing whether Allah has willed something or not until after we have done the deed – after we have chosen to do it. We cannot say, “Allah has willed this for me,” until the sin has already taken place. So once the sin does take place, once it is committed, why was it committed? Because of our freewill and our choice to do it. Therefore, sinners have no justification or excuse before Allah. He nullifies this claim by saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا أَشْرَكْنَا وَلا آبَاؤُنَا وَلا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ۖ كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّى ذَاقُوا بَأْسَنَا </span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Those who associated others (in worship) with Allah will say, “If Allah had willed, we would not have associated partners with him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against his will).” Likewise, those before them denied until they tasted our punishment.</span> [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:148]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they had any justification for making their Shirk (worshipping others with Allah), then they would not have been punished by Allah; they would have been spared the punishment. But they had no right or excuse to worship others, so they were punished. As another example, consider that if someone were informed about a land, safe and peaceful, with sufficient provision and affluence for everyone, everywhere and with successful commerce and a strong economy not found in another land. At the same time, the person is also told of a land where people constantly fear for their lives, live in chaos, having no reliable economy, no law and order, no guaranteed safety for anyone. To which land would he choose to travel? Of course, he travels to the first land and he does not imagine someone, somewhere has forced him to make his decision. He chose the first land based on his own determination and freewill.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have before us now a similar choice: a path to good and a path leading to evil. Allah has already clearly simplified the two for us: this is the path to Paradise, this one to Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, he explained some of what is waiting for us in Paradise of blessings and enjoyment and some punishments that await us in the fire. Which path do we take? Clearly, we would choose the path to Paradise just like we would choose to move to the peaceful land over the land in turmoil. Had we chosen the path to the fire, we alone would have justifiably been to blame. We would have made the worst, most foolish choice just as if we had decided to move to the land of fear and instability. Everyone would understandably hold us responsible for our own choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in Allah’s statement &#8220;<strong>For whoever wills among you</strong>&#8220;, he confirms that each individual has the choice and will to decide his actions; he has freewill. Still, we know that even before we do or will anything, once it has happened, we know full well that Allah willed it to happen. Otherwise, it would not have occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many times, people become determined to do something, yet at the last minute they find themselves unable to do it for whatever reason. This is because Allah did not will such an action to take place. For example, we may decide to go to the mosque to attend a lecture, yet on our way there, we may then remember we have some other obligations which prevent us from attending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a final example, it is said that a common Bedouin, knowing little about the details of religion, was asked, “<strong>How do you know you have a Lord?</strong>” he answered, “<strong>By unfulfilled determination and changes in plans</strong>.” In other words, a person may be fully determined to do something, completely resolved and able to do it. Yet, something totally contradictory to his intentions occurs. Who changed his resolve? He does not think someone made him prefer something over his original decision. Instead, Allah simply did not will it to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, a person may plan to do something and sets out to accomplish his plans, but he then finds within himself some reason not to carry out his plans. It may be something physically preventing him or simply a change of mind; he decides to do something else instead. All of this is from Allah (عزّ وجل).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 1 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;">al-Ḥamdu lillāhi Rabbil-‘Ālamīn</span>)<br />
<strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah, the lord of all creations.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; (al-Ḥamd):</strong></span> This word الْحَمْدُ (<strong>al-Ḥamd</strong>) is used only to describe someone, out of love and honor, with complete perfection of self, attributes, and actions. So, Allah is perfect in his self, his attributes, and his actions. This praising, however, must be with a condition, it must be made with love and honor. The people of knowledge say that simply describing someone with perfection yet not out of real love and honor for the praised one is not called حَمْدُ (Ḥamd). Rather, in that case it would only be called مَدْح (<strong>Madḥ</strong>) (a lesser degree of praise or admiration). Therefore, this (second) type of praising occurs often from people while they may not really love the one they are praising. Often, they only want to gain something from them. For example, some poets stand before their government leaders and recite poetry of amazing praiseworthy descriptions of them yet void of any real love for them. The poets’ love is for the wealth they are given or they do this out of fear of the leaders. On the contrary, our praise for our lord is a form of praise out of love and honor.<strong> So, &#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; is to praise the one described with total perfection out of love and honor for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ال (al-) in الْحَمْدُ (al-Ḥamd) is inclusive, meaning that it includes all forms of praise and thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;are for Allah&#8221; (lillāhi):</span> </strong>The لِ (li) is to show possession and a sense of deserving. The name “Allah” is the proper name of our lord ( عزّ وجلّ ) and no one else is given this name; it means the one god that is worshipped out of love and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;the lord&#8221; (Rabb):</span></strong> The word “lord” here includes three main descriptions: the creator, the owner, and the controller of all affairs. So, he is the creator of all that exists, the owner of all that exists, and the controller of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;of all creations&#8221; (al-‘Ālamīn):</span> </strong>As for the word “‘Ālamīn”, the scholars say it refers to anything and everything other than Allah. Everything else besides Allah is described with this word because the very existence of everything is a sign or indication (in Arabic: Ālam) that they have a creator (سبحانه وتعالى) In every form of creation there is a sign indicating the existence of its creator, his capability, wisdom, mercy, power, and the rest of his attributes of lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 1:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. One of the beneficial points we gain from this verse is the affirmation of praise of perfection to Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). This is shown by the “al-” in the word “al-Ḥamd” because this definite article in Arabic grammar is inclusive to include all forms or praise and gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It also shows that Allah alone deserves all forms of praise and gratitude. For this reason, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to say whenever something happened he was happy with:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ تُتِمُّ الصَّالِحَات</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah by whose favor righteous deeds are fulfilled.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would say when if something did not please him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah in all situations</strong>.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another point of benefit from the verse is the description of Allah with his sole right to worship first before describing him with his lordship. This is either indicated because the name “Allah” is his proper name, specific to him and the source of all the rest of His names; or it is due to the fact that the people the messengers were sent to used to only deny Allah’s sole right to worship. Most of the people did not deny Allah’s lordship (that he is the creator, owner, and controller of everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. This verse also proves Allah’s complete lordship over all of the creations due to his statement: &#8220;<strong>The lord of all creation</strong>s.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>] Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 3803) and al-Ḥākim in his “Mustadrak” (1/449) and he said, “This ḥadīth has an authentic chain of narrators.” adh-Dhahabī agreed with him. The famous ḥadīth scholar, al-Albānī, said it is “ḥasan” in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3066).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī. The part of the  ḥadīth explained in this article is ḥadīth number twenty-four of that book.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوْا ضُرِّي فَتَضُرُّوْنِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوْا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُوْنِي</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">Oh my servants, you will never be able to harm me, and you will never be able to benefit me</span>.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are incapable of ever reaching a state in which they could benefit or harm Allah, for Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. He neither needs the obedience of his servants, nor does any benefit of such obedience reach him. It is only the servants who benefit from their obedience. Likewise, he is not harmed in any way by their disobedience, but it is they who harm themselves therewith. Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا يَحْزُنكَ الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَن يَضُرُّوا اللَّهَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be grieved by those who hasten into disbelief. They will certainly never harm Allah at all.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ اللَّهَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تَكْفُرُوا فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَنِيًّا حَمِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">But if you disbelieve, then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. And ever is Allah free of need, praiseworthy.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:131]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says, quoting the prophet Moses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ مُوسَى إِن تَكْفُرُوا أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي الأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Moses said, “If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely, indeed, Allah is Free of need, praiseworthy.”</span> [Sūrah Ibrāhīm, 14:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever disbelieves, certainly Allah free of need from all creations.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَا دِمَاؤُهَا وَلَٰكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Neither their meat, nor their blood (e.g., of animals slaughtered for charity) reaches Allah; but what reaches him is piety from you</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥajj, 22:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) loves his servants to remain conscious of him and obey him, just as he dislikes them to disobey him. For this reason, Allah is happier with people’s repentance than the happiness felt by a person who, having lost his riding animal in a vast desert upon which are his food and drink, searches desperately for his mount to the point of exhaustion and finally, giving up all hope of ever finding it, gives in to certain despair that his life is as an end, and he abandons himself to death. As he succumbs to his exhaustion and sleeps, he later wakes up to find his riding animal standing right before him. This is one of the highest levels of happiness imaginable among creation.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is even happier than such a person despite the fact that he is in no way in need of his servants’ obedience or their repentance. Rather, he returns the benefit thereof back to them out his generosity and kindness toward his servants and his love for their well-being and his desire to prevent harm from reaching them. And in return, he loves for his servants to know him, love him, fear him, remain constantly aware of him, and to obey him and exert effort in getting closer to him. He loves for them to know that no one else can forgive their sins and that he is fully capable of showing forgiveness for the sins of his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this ḥadīth from ‘Abdul Raḥmān Ibn Ghanam from Abū Dharr, it is reported that Allah said, “<strong>Whoever among you knows that I am capable of showing forgiveness and were he to ask for my forgiveness, I would forgive him and would not mind at all</strong>.”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي لَو أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوْا عَلَى أَتْقَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا زَادَ ذَلِكَ فِي مُلْكِي شَيْئًا، يَا عِبَادِي لَو أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوْا عَلَى أَفْجَرِ قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Oh my servants, if the first of you and the last of you, the people and jinn among you, were all to have hearts as righteous as the most righteous man among you, that would not increase my kingdom in anything. Oh my servants, if the first of you and the last of you, the people and jinn among you, were to have hearts as wicked as the most wicked man among you, that would not decrease my kingdom in anything.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that the kingdom of Allah will not increase in anything even if all creatures were as pious and had hearts as the most righteous person among them. Similarly, his kingdom will never decrease by the sins of sinners even if all the jinn and humans were to be as cruel and evil, having hearts as evil as the most wicked person among them. Allah ( سُبْحَانَهُ ) is self-sufficient, having no need whatsoever of anyone else. There is absolute perfection in his self, his characteristics, and in his actions. His dominion and authority is also perfect with no weakness or flaws to diminish it in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people believe that the creations brought about by Allah – those present now – are the most perfect forms than had Allah created them in any other way. And the evil we witness among creation is a conditional type of evil dependent on some things within creation; it is not an absolute evil existing in creation such that its nonexistence would be better than its current existence under all circumstances. Rather, the fact that such aspects of evil are present is actually better than if they were not. They say that such an understanding is the meaning of Allah’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">In your hand is all good.</span> [Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of the prophet’s ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Evil is not to be attributed to you.</span> [Muslim (no. 771)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Absolute evil – that which the absent thereof would be better than its presence – is not present in your dominion. This kind of absolute evil is not to be found in Allah’s kingdom because Allah ( تَعَالَى ) brings about his creation and what it requires of wisdom and justice. Sometimes he distinguishes particular people (perhaps in this life or the next) with favors which he does not give others out of his justice and what that necessitates of complete wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet in such an understanding there is an issue which contradicts the point being made in the ḥadīth in that were all creations to have the best characteristics of piety and righteousness, that would not increase and improve his dominion at all. And were all the creations to have wicked characteristics that would lower the status and manner in which they were initially created, that would still not decrease the dominion of Allah in any way. [In other words, perhaps it is possible to become better or worse than one’s initial creation due to belief or disbelief in Allah, obedience or disobedience, etc.] And this (the fact that people have the choice to become better or worse) shows that Allah’s dominion and kingdom are still perfect in every way; it can neither be improved, nor perfected or completed even by obedience just as it cannot be decreased by disobedience. Nothing at all affects its perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statement (of the ḥadīth) mentioning the heart also indicate that the source of righteousness and wickedness is the heart. When the heart is pious and conscious of Allah, the (actions of the) limbs will be righteous, and when the heart is evil, the limbs will be likewise.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">التَّقْوَى هَا هُنَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Righteousness is right here.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pointed to his chest.[Muslim (no. 2564)]</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>] This comparison is taken from a <em>ḥadīth</em> in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَلَّهُ أَشَدُّ فَرَحًا بِتَوْبَةِ عَبْدِهِ حِينَ يَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ أَحَدِكُمْ كَانَ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ بِأَرْضِ فَلاةٍ فَانْفَلَتَتْ مِنْهُ وَعَلَيْهَا طَعَامُهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَشَرَابُهُ، فَأَيِسَ مِنْهَا، فَأَتَى شَجَرَةً فَاضْطَجَعَ فِي ظِلِّهَا قَدْ أَيِسَ مِنْ رَاحِلَتِهِ فَبَيْنَا هُوَ كَذَلِكَ إِذَا هُوَ بِهَا قَائِمَةً عِنْدَهُ فَأَخَذَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بِخِطَامِهَا ثُمَّ قَالَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ: اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ عَبْدِي وَأَنَا رَبُّكَ! أَخْطَأَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is happier with the repentance of his servant when he repents to him than if one of you were traveling on his riding animal in a vast desert but it escapes while carrying his food and drink. After giving up all hope of catching it, the man then reclines in the shade of a tree, having despaired of finding his mount. While in such a state, he suddenly finds it standing right next to him so he takes its reins and cries out from sheer joy, “Oh Allah, you are my servant and I am your lord!” He makes such a mistake only from extreme happiness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 4939) and al-Bukāhrī” (no. 5863).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>] This point has been reported in a <em>ḥadīth </em>in al-Bukāhrī (no. 52) and Muslim (no. 1599) in which the prophet ( صلّى الله<br />
عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا وَإنَّ فِي الْجَسَدِ مُضْغَةً إذَا صَلَحَتْ صَلَحَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ ، وَإِذَا فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ ، ألا وَهِيَ القَلْبُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is within the body an organ, if it is pure the entire body will be purified, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupted. It is certainly the heart.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī.  In this article, last part of the  twenty-fourth ḥadīth of that book explained.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلا يَلُوْمَنَّ إِلاّ نَفْسَهُ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“&#8230; So whoever finds good, let him thank Allah, and whoever finds other than that, let him blame only himself.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that anything good is from Allah as a favor from himself to his worshipper even though the latter may not actually deserve it. And anything evil is from the children of Adam, from following their inclinations and desires as Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">What comes to you of good is from Allah, but what comes to you of evil is from yourself.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) once said, “<strong>A worshipper should hope from none but Allah and should fear nothing but his own sins</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah wants prosperity and guidance for someone, he facilitates a way for the individual to obey him, and this is a favor from Allah. But when Allah abandons someone, he entrusts all affairs of the person to the individual himself; Allah renounces the person by removing all connections between himself and the individual. So Satan is then able to deceive such a person so that he becomes negligent of remembering Allah. He follows his own inclinations and desires and consequently his affairs are lost and forsaken. All the while, this is still fair and just from Allah because the evidence has already been established upon the individual by the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan and the sending of the messenger. So there is no excuse before Allah for any of mankind after the sending of the messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is meant by “<strong>So whoever finds good</strong>” is whoever finds good in this life, then such a person is obliged to thank Allah, especially for the good reward of one’s good deeds that may be hastened in this life as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer, we will surely cause him to live a good life. And we will surely give such individuals their reward according to the best of what they used to do.</span> [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (upon the understanding above) such a person would be obliged to blame himself for the negative consequences he may experience in the worldly life for the bad deeds he committed as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الأَدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent.</span> [Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for a true believer, when he is afflicted with any hardship in life, he looks inward, holding himself responsible. This in turn encourages him to return back to Allah with repentance and asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if what is meant by “So whoever finds good…whoever finds other than that” is in the hereafter, then this may be a way of Allah informing that those who find good in the hereafter will thank and praise Allah for that, and those who find otherwise should blame only themselves although at such a time blaming will be of no use. And this is an Arabic linguistic form in which the text is that of a command yet the meaning is actually to inform of a future event just as is the case with the ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَيَّ مُتَعَمِّدًا فَلْيَتَبَوَّأْ مَقْعَدَهُ مِنْ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever intentionally lies against me, let him occupy his seat in the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[This ḥadīth is mutawātir, meaning that it has been narrated by so many different chains of narrators that it is considered authentic. See for example ḥadīth no.1841 of “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” by al-Albānī</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Whoever lies against me will indeed occupy his seat in the Hellfire. [The text is in the form of a command but is a way of informing of a future occurrence.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also informed us that the people of Paradise will thank Allah for that which he provides them of his bounty; he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الأَنْهَارُ وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And we will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment, (while) flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has guided us to this, and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.”</span> [Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:43]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ وَأَوْرَثَنَا الْأَرْضَ نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَاءُ.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has fulfilled his promise to us and has made us inherit the earth (so) we may settle in Paradise wherever we will.”</span> [Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا الْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ  الَّذِي أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ الْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِ لا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has removed from us sorrow. Indeed, our lord is forgiving and appreciative – he who has settled us in the home of duration out of his bounty. There touches us therein no fatigue, and there touches us therein no weariness (of mind).”</span> [Sūrah al-Fāṭir, 35:34-35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the fire, Allah informs us they will be blaming themselves, disgusted with and hating of their own souls. Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُم مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي فَلا تَلُومُونِي وَلُومُوا أَنفُسَكُم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, “Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves.”</span> [Sūrah Ibrāhīm, 14:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يُنَادَوْنَ لَمَقْتُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ مِن مَّقْتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ إِذْ تُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى الإِيمَاَانِ فَتَكْفُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, those who disbelieve will be addressed (in Hell), “The hatred of Allah was (even) greater than your hatred of yourselves when you were invited to faith, but you refused.”</span> [Sūrah Ghāfir, 40:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous predecessors used to strive in doing good deeds, fearing the time when deeds will come to an end and they may then blame themselves for their shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was once said to Masrūq, “If only you would ease up with some of your worship in which you exert yourself.” He replied, “By Allah, even if he came to me and told me he would not punish me, I would exert myself in worship (of him).” He was asked, “Why is that?” to which he said: So that my own soul would pardon me if it entered the fire and so I would not have to blame it. Has there not come to you the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And I swear by the self-reproaching soul</span>.[Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will blame and reproach themselves when they reach Hell. When the angels of punishment embrace them and stand between them and what they desire, when their hopes are cut off, and when mercy is withheld from them, every one of them will begin blaming and reproaching his own soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muṭraf Ibn ‘Abdullah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Exert yourself in doing good deeds. If the decision is as we hope for—the mercy of Allah and his forgiveness—then for us will be levels (in Paradise). And if the decision is severe as we fear and of which we are cautious, let us not then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">رَبَّنَا أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness other than what we used to do.”</span> [Sūrah Fāṭir, 35:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will then say, “We did deeds but they did not benefit us.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fifteenth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Believers See Their Lord</strong></span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Some) faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span>. [Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain the verse, &#8220;<strong>faces that day</strong>&#8221; means on the last day, the Day of Resurrection. &#8220;<strong>radiant</strong>&#8221; here includes beauty because the word used in the verse comes from the Arabic word نَضَارَة (naḍārah) which means beauty. This meaning is also indicated in the statement of Allah (in which a similar form of the same word is used):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So Allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness.</span> [Sūrah al-Insān, 76:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words: beauty in their faces and happiness in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>looking at their Lord</strong>&#8220;, it is real sight which occurs from the faces and by the eyes. This is different from insight that may occur within the heart (similar to the English usage, “I will look into it.”) which means thinking about or considering something. Here, however, the looking occurs from the faces and is directed toward the Lord (عزّ وجلّ) just as is explicitly indicated by &#8220;<strong>at their Lord</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble verse means that these radiant, beautiful faces will be looking directly at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ) and, consequently, will increase in beauty. Look at how these faces were prepared, made ready to look at Allah (عزّ وجلّ) – they will have been made bright and beautiful in preparation to look upon the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is a clear proof that Allah will actually be seen with actual eyes and this is the position of mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah (<em>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have proven this with the same verses mentioned herein and they also learn this from the numerous statements of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) transmitted to the companions and to their followers and so on. So these texts are explicitly clear as evidence confirming this (the believers seeing Allah in the hereafter) because they are within the book of Allah (تعالى) and the Sunnah of his messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and they are reported by many different chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah hold the belief that the looking, the sight mentioned here, is real. It does not mean “perception” or “complete awareness” because Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Vision does not perceive him. </span>[Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as knowing with one’s heart does not necessarily equate to perceiving his true reality. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But they do not encompass him with knowledge. </span>[Sūrah ṬāHā, 20:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know our Lord with our hearts yet we still do not know exactly how he is. Similarly, on the Day of Resurrection we will see our Lord with our own eyes, yet our sight will still not completely perceive him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse indicating that believers will see their Lord is the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">On thrones, looking. </span>[Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah did not mention in this verse specifically what they are looking at so it is general, including anything that is pleasing to look at. The greatest and most pleasing sight is to look upon Allah (تعالى) as he says in the very next verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ نَضْرَةَ النَّعِيمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the context of the verse is similar to the first one, &#8220;faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord&#8221; and they will be looking at everything that pleases them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse regarding the believers looking at Allah is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.</span> [Sūrah Yūnus, 10:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;the best&#8221;, it is Paradise and &#8220;even more&#8221; is the believers looking at the face of Allah. This is how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained this verse as is confirmed in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim and others:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ ، قَالَ : يَقُولُ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ.؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُونَ : أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا ؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنْ النَّارِ ؟ قَالَ : فَيَكْشِفُ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> الْحِجَابَ فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise, Allah (تبارك وتعالى) will ask, “Do you want me to give you something more?” They will say, “Have you not brightened our faces? Have you not already admitted us into Paradise and saved us from the fire?” He will then remove the covering and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ)</span> [Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After saying that, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then recited the verse, &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; So this verse is evidence of seeing Allah as the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) has explained, and no doubt, he is the most knowledgeable person of the Quran’s meanings. He explained that it means looking at the face of Allah and this is the &#8220;even more&#8221; reward the believers will be given in addition to the previous delights of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this blessing is not the same types of blessing as are well-known of Paradise. Many of the delights of Paradise are physical in nature: rivers to enjoy, physical rewards, fruits, pure spouses, etc. Then the blessings and pleasures of the heart follow. But looking at Allah is a direct delight pleasing to the heart. The people of Paradise will have never seen anything more enjoyable or satisfying than that. We ask Allah to make us those who see him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing is in no way comparable to anything else, not the fruits of Paradise, its rivers, or anything else. Because of this, Allah said &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; because it is in addition to even the best rewards of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There they will have all that they desire and with us is even more.</span> [Sūrah Qāf, 50:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars have explained &#8220;but with us is even more&#8221; just how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained it – that it is looking at the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those are the four verses the author (Ibn Taymiyyah) mentions as proof of the believers seeing Allah. There is also a fifth verse from which Imam al-Shāfi’ī deduced that the believers will see Allah. It is the statement of Allah (تعالى) about the wicked sinners:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كَلَّا إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">No! Surely, they will be veiled from (seeing) their Lord that day.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point he makes from the verse is that since such people will be veiled from Allah due to his anger with them, then it can be understood that those with whom he is pleased will not be veiled. So if the people who gain his anger are veiled from Allah then the people who gain his pleasure will see Him (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This deduction of Imam al-Shāfi’ī is definitely very strong because if everyone was going to be veiled, prevented from seeing their Lord, then there would have been no reason to specifically mention only the wicked people in the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also believe that seeing Allah in this life is impossible. This is because the current nature and condition of humans is one that cannot bear looking at Allah (عزّ وجلّ). How could it when the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us about his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ ، لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">His veil is light. If he were to remove it, the splendor of his face would burn his creation, consuming it as far as his sight reaches.</span>[Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for seeing Allah in the hereafter, it is certainly possible because people that day will be in a different world. Their nature and condition will be different than they are in this life. And this is known from all the texts of the Quran and Sunnah that tell about how people will be, what they will experience during the events of the resurrection and of their final abode in either the home of bliss or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the believers seeing their Lord, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was once with his companions on a night when the full moon was out. He looked up at the moon and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ ، لا تُضَامُونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ ، فَإِنْ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ  لا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَصَلاةٍ قَبْلَ غُرُوبِ الشَّمْسِ فَافْعَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">You will certainly see your Lord just as you can see this moon; you will have no trouble in seeing him. So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement, “You will certainly see your Lord” is addressed to the believers. As for “just as you can see this moon,” this is a real, actual seeing because when we see the moon, it is actual sight with our eyes. The comparison here is between the sight of the moon and the sight of Allah, and it is not a comparison between the moon and Allah because there is nothing like or comparable to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) would sometimes try to bring the meaning of what he is talking about closer to people by mentioning what they understand of perceptible things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, Abū Razīn al-‘Uqaylī, a companion of the messenger, once asked him, “Messenger of Allah, will each one of us see his Lord, individually on the Day of Resurrection? And what is a sign similar to that among his creation?” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم .) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَبَا رَزِينٍ ، أَلَيْسَ كُلُّكُمْ يَرَى الْقَمَرَ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ مُخْلِيًا بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abū Razīn, do you not each individually see the full moon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Razīn answered, “Yes.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاللَّهُ أَعْظَمُ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ خَلْقٌ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللَّهِ ، فَاللَّهُ أَجَلُّ وَأَعْظَمُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is even greater. That (the moon) is only a single creation from Allah’s creation, but Allah is even more exalted and greater.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Recorded by Imām Aḥmad (4/11) and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4731). al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (3957)</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>you will have no trouble in seeing him</strong>” in the earlier ḥadīth, different wordings have come in similar narrations, but the point is that no one will prevent another from seeing Allah due to crowding or anything else. Each person will see him ( (سبحانه وتعالى while he is in the utmost state of tranquility and peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so</strong>,” the prayer before sunrise is Fajr, the morning prayer, and before sunset is ‘Aṣr, the afternoon prayer. ‘Aṣr is even better than Fajr because it is the middle prayer which Allah has specifically told us to safeguard after mentioning prayers in general.[167] But Fajr is better than ‘Aṣr from a different perspective in that it is the prayer that is specifically witnessed by the angels as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of night and the morning recitation; surely the morning recitation is witnessed</span>. [Sūrah al-Isrā, 17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ صَلَّى الْبَرْدَيْنِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever prayers the two cool ones will enter Paradise.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two cool prayers are Fajr and ‘Aṣr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What practical benefit do we gain from knowing these verses (and ḥadīth) about the believers seeing their Lord in Paradise? There is no greater effect on a person’s behavioral approach and direction in life than this. When anyone realizes that his main objective, the height of his reward is to look upon the face of his Lord, this life and everything in it then becomes almost worthless to him in comparison. Nothing else would compare or be as precious to him as reaching that moment of seeing Allah (عزّ وجلّ). It is the goal of every seeker; it is the final achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know that you will one day see your Lord with your own eyes, then by Allah this life would not mean a thing to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this world is nothing in comparison because the sight of Allah’s face is the prize for which the competitors compete, the goal to which the racers race, and it is the greatest triumph of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this, will you strive to reach it or not?</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[167] This occurs in Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:238:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Attend constantly to prayers and (in particular) to the middle prayer, and stand up truly obedient to Allah.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Our Lord&#8217;s Descent</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الآخِرُ ، يَقُولُ : مَنْ يَدْعُونِي فَأَسْتَجِيبَ لَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْأَلُنِي فَأُعْطِيَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْتَغْفِرُنِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">؟ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Our Lord, the blessed and exalted, descends every night to the sky of this world when the last third of the night remains. He asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 1145) and Muslim (no. 758)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth is a proof confirming the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven, the sky of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people of knowledge said this ḥadīth has come with many different chains of narration, and the scholars have always agreed that it is one of the famous ḥadīth often mentioned by the scholars of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) says,  &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends every night to the sky of this world</strong>.&#8221; Allah’s descent is real and actual because, as we have mentioned before, anything mentioned with a pronoun that refers back to Allah, it must be attributed to him in a real, actual manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should believe in it and accept it as truth, saying just as the ḥadīth says, “<strong>Our Lord descends to the sky of this world</strong>,” to the lowest heaven closest to the earth. There are seven heavens, and Allah (عزّ وجلّ) descends at this time during the night to be near his worshippers just as he does during the afternoon on the Day of ‘Arafah (during the pilgrimage), praising and boasting to the angels about his worshippers. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>every night</strong>&#8221; it is general to include every single night of the year. &#8220;<strong>when the last third of the night remains</strong>&#8220;. In Islamic legislation, the night begins at sunset and this is unanimously agreed upon. The difference (among scholars) however comes with regards to when the night ends. Does it end with the appearance of first light or the actual rising of the sun? Apparently, the night, according to legislation, ends with the appearance of first light, and the common, “astral” night ends with sunrise. Allah asks, &#8221; “Who is calling on me…”. This is a question yet really intended as an encouragement and motivation rather than expecting an actual answer. It is like his statement (in the Qur&#8217;an):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment?</span> [Sūrah al-Ṣaf, 61:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…calling on me…</strong>” saying, “Oh Lord…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can answer him?</strong>” This is the result and reward for doing the first part – calling on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “<strong>Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him?</strong>” such as saying, “I ask You for Paradise,” or similar things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Who is asking for my forgiveness…</strong>” saying, “Oh Allah, forgive me,” or “I seek your forgiveness, Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can forgive him?</strong>” Forgiveness means to conceal one’s sins and overlook them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it should be clear to every person who reads this ḥadīth that what is meant by “<strong>descends</strong>” here is that Allah Himself descends. We do not even need to say He descends “<strong>personally</strong>” because as long as the verb is associated with Him, then He himself does it. Still, some scholars did say, “He personally descends.” They resorted to saying that, compelled to adding “personally” only because there are those people who twist the meaning of ḥadīth, claiming that what really descends is the decision and decree of Allah. Others say it is Allah’s mercy that descends, and even others say it is one of his angels that descends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these are incorrect. For one thing, Allah’s decision and decree are constantly descending, and not only during the last third of night as he ( تعالى ) says generally:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُدَبِّرُ الأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him</span>.[Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And to him the matter will return, all of it</span>.[Sūrah Hūd, 11:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their statement that it is really only the mercy of Allah that descends to the worldly sky when the last third of night remains, Allah is above such deficiencies and insults! Mercy does not descend except at that time?! Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you have of blessing, it is from Allah</span>. [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every blessing and favor is from Allah, and they are the results of his mercy; they can be witnessed at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We could then ask: What good does it do for us if mercy descends only down to the sky (and no further)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say it is really only an angel that descends, we ask: Does it make sense that an angel would say, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me for anything…”?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that these claims are distorted meanings, they are incorrect and proven so by the ḥadīth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, such people who claim these things do not know more about Allah than Allah’s messenger, they are certainly not more sincere in advising the servants of Allah than his messenger, and they are not more precise and eloquent in speech than the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people also ask: How can you say Allah descends? If He does so, then what about His being high above everything? What about His being over the throne? If He descends, this would involve movement and relocation. Also, if He descends, this would be an action that happens and anything that happens must have a cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this we say: This is baseless and pointless arguing. There is no reason not to say that Allah’s descent is real. Do you know what Allah deserves (of characteristics and descriptions) more than the companions of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions never made any of these false assumptions and conjectures. Instead they listened, they believed, they accepted, and they trusted it as absolute truth. Yet now, you people come and challenge the meanings, arguing for the sake of falsehood, asking, “How? Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say Allah descends, and we do not delve into asking, “What about his throne? Does this mean he leaves it or not?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being above, we say he descends and yet he is still high above his creation because “descent” here does not necessarily mean that he is surrounded by the lowest heaven to which he descends while the other heavens are above him. Rather, he is not contained within anything of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah actually descends in a real manner while he is actually high above in a real manner, and nothing is similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rising over the throne is an action, not a permanent, personal characteristic. We should not, as far as I am concerned, begin asking whether he leaves the throne or not. Instead, we should keep silent about it just as the companions did, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the scholars of those who follow the Sunnah take one of three positions regarding the issue of whether Allah leaves his throne during his descent. Some say he leaves the throne, others say he does not leave it, and others say we should remain silent and not delve into the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says in his <em>al-Risālah al-‘Arshiyyah</em> that Allah does not leave the throne (during his descent) because the evidence confirming he is on the throne is strong and explicit just as this ḥadīth is also a strong, explicit proof of his descent. The actions and characteristics of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) are not to be measured by those of creation. So we should leave the texts of his being on the throne confirmed as they are just as we leave the text of his descent confirmed as it is. We say he is established on his throne and yet he still descends to the sky of this world; Allah alone knows the “how” of it. Our minds are too deficient and incomplete to know everything about Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position is that Allah leaves the throne during his descent and the third position is to remain silent – in other words, not to say whether he does or does not leave his throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people more recently bring up yet another point of confusion. <strong>Since the earth is round and revolves around the sun, they ask how Allah can descend during the last third of the night when the last third is a constant time</strong>. For example, when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leaves this time, Europe and surrounding countries enter it. So is Allah constantly and forever descending?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reply, we say: First and foremost, you should simply believe and accept that Allah descends during this specific time. If you do believe in it, then there is nothing else required from you. Do not go into asking, “How?” Instead, accept that when the last third of night remains in Saudi Arabia, then Allah descends, and when it remains in America, Allah also descends. And His descent finishes when the light of morning appears in any place, respective to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, our position is that we believe and accept everything that has come to us from Allah’s messenger, Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in that Allah comes down to the sky of this world, the lowest heaven, when the last third of night remains and he asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Beneficial Points We Learn from This Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This amazing ḥadīth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah is high above creation based on the words, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah does actions by his choice and will—these are known as “action” characteristics (see footnote no. 7 of the <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/in-the-company-of-allaah-confirming-that-allaah-is-with-his-creation-shaykh-ibn-al-uthaymeen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main article</a>)—based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends…when the last third of the night remains.</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah speaks based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>He asks…</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms Allah’s kindness and generosity based on his questions, <strong>“Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should take advantage of this part of the night, asking for whatever they need from Allah, calling upon him, and asking his forgiveness as he asks, “Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?” And again, the word “Who” here is presented in the form of a question but is actually intended to motivate rather than ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should take advantage of this chance because nothing that has passed of your life is in your favor except the times you spent in obedience to Allah. Perhaps more days may pass you by, but when death comes it will be as if you were only born that minute. At that time, everything of one’s past life will mean nothing to him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>] The ḥadīth about this is recorded by Muslim (no. 1348). The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ أَنْ يُعْتِقَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ عَبْدًا مِنْ النَّارِ مِنْ يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ وَإِنَّهُ لَيَدْنُو ثُمَّ يُبَاهِي بِهِمْ الْمَلائِكَةَ ، فَيَقُولُ :  مَا </span><span style="color:#000000;"> أَرَادَ هَؤُلاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is no day on which Allah frees more servants from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. He comes near (them) and praises and boasts about them to the angels, saying, “What do these want?” (or “Anything they want!”)</span></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He ascended upon the Throne. He causes the night to cover the day, it follows it swiftly, and the sun and the moon and the stars are subservient to His command. Certainly creation and commandment are His alone. Exalted is Allaah, the Lord of the whole of the creation.</span> [7:54] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>8</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">8</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Inna</em></strong>”: this is a particle for emphasis and it brings about the accusative case, and it is an introduction for an oath. An oath is to be understood as coming before it, which is taken to be, “By Allaah!”. “<strong><em>Inna Rabbakum</em></strong>”, (indeed your Lord): so this is the complement of the understood oath. “<em>Inna Rabbakum</em>”: meaning, your Creator and the One Who nurtured you with favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>… is Allaah</strong>”: not anyone else besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He mentioned the proof for that saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The One Who created the heavens and the earth</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear proof for the Lordship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He created the heavens and the earth. No-one else created anything from either of them, and no-one helped Him, He the Perfect and Most High upon that. Rather He is alone in creating.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He created the heavens and the earth</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does anyone from the people of shirk or the atheists oppose this and say, “Allaah did not create the heavens and the earth, rather the one who created them was so-and-so”, or, “I created them”, or “Such-and-such idol created them”? Has anyone from the creation said this in previous times or lately, even though this <em>aayah</em> is recited night and day, and no-one can oppose it, and nor will anyone ever be able to oppose it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ &#8211; </span></strong>“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In six days</strong></span>”: these awe-inspiring and tremendous created things were created by Allaah in six days, and He was able to create them in a single moment, however He created them in six days for a wise purpose which is known to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And the six days, the first of them was Sunday and the last of them was the day of Friday. So on the day of Friday the creation was completed, and therefore this day became the greatest of the days of the week. And it is the noblest one of the days, and it is the <em>‘Eed</em> of the week and it is the most excellent of the days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">خير يوم طلعت فيه الشمس يوم الجمعة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best day on which the sun has arisen, is the day of Friday”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and An-Nasaa’ee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the creation of the creation was completed on it, and on it Aadam was created, and he was entered into paradise and he was sent down from it and on it the Last Hour will be established, all of that will be on the day of Friday, so it is the most excellent of the days, and it was the last of the days of the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatever they contain.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He ascended upon the Throne</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This (i.e. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ  </span></strong>“<em>thumma</em>”) is a particle which joins and which indicates sequence, meaning that His Ascending upon the Throne came after the creation of the heavens and the earth because it is from the Attributes which are actions which Allaah does whenever He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <em>Istawaa’ </em>(He ascended upon) is: He ascended and was High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-‘Arsh</em></strong>: it is the ceiling of the created things. And it is in the language: <strong><em>as-Sareer</em> (</strong>a throne), and it is a Throne which has supports and is carried by the Angels and it is the greatest and most tremendous of the created things, and the highest one of the created things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> </strong>(ascending): is an Attribute from the Attributes of Allaah which are actions, as befits His Majesty, He the Perfect and Most High. It is not like the mounting of one created being upon another created object, and He has no need of the Throne since He is the One Who holds and maintains the Throne and other than it:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah holds the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, then no-one else besides Him could hold them</span>. </strong>[35:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Throne is in need of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, since it is something created, and Allaah has no need of the Throne or anything else. However, He ascended upon it for a wise purpose which is known to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And <strong><em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> </strong>(Ascending) is a type of <strong><em>Al-‘Uloow</em></strong> (being High and Exalted), however <em>Al-‘Uloow</em> is an Attribute of His Self. As for <em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> then it is an Attribute which is an action which He does whenever He wishes He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He causes the night to cover the day </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He causes the night to be covered over with the day, and He causes the day to be covered over with the night so you see the creation being in light and then the night covers it over and it becomes dark, and the night is covered over by the day so it becomes bright.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It pursues it swiftly </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This one comes after that one immediately and is not delayed. So when the night departs the day comes, and when they day departs the night comes right away, this one is not delayed after this one. And this is from the completeness of His Ability, He the Perfect and Most High, that this one does not lag behind that one. And the sun is the tremendous star which is well-known, and the moon is likewise a celestial body from the seven major celestial bodies which orbit around each one of them floats and orbits around the earth, and the earth is fixed and still, He made it settled – meaning settled and firm for the welfare of the servants, and the sun and the rest of the celestial bodies orbit around it, not as is said by the people of conjecture who now say, those who claim to have knowledge, they say that the sun is fixed and the earth orbits around it, this is the opposite of what occurs in the Qur’aan.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the sun runs on its fixed course to its appointed term </strong></span>[36:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they say the sun is fixed, O how Perfect is Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the stars</strong></span>”: they are the stars, <strong>“they are subservient to His command</strong>”: they are subservient in their moving around and their orbiting continually and not slackening, and this a refutation of those who worship the sun and the moon and the stars, because they are subservient to the command of Allaah, they are under command. Allaah is the One Who causes them to move, and it is Allaah who can cause them to stop if He wishes, He the Perfect and Most High. So they are subservient, under control, they have no control at all over the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect commands them, so they proceed, and they orbit and they give off light in accordance with His creational command, He the Perfect and Most High. This one rises and this one sets, and they follow each other in  succession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ash-Shams</em> (the sun), and <em>Al-Qamar</em> (the moon) and <em>An-Nujoom</em> (the stars) are in the accusative case because of being conjoined, because <em>As-Samaawaat</em> (the heavens) was in the accusative case, because it was the object of the verb, and the sign that it is in the accusative case is that it has a <em>kasrah </em>upon it in place of the <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah, </em>because it is a sound feminine plural. And <em>Al-Ar<u>d</u></em> (the earth) is in the accusative case as is shown by the <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah, </em>then He said, “and the sun and the moon” &#8211; they are joined grammatically to something <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which is in the accusative case and what is joined to something in the accusative case is itself in the accusative case.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>  i.e. they are ‘joined’ to the heavens grammatically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Musakhkharaatin</em></strong></span>”, (they are subservient): is the accusative case because it is the accusative of state or condition, meaning their condition is that they are subservient. And the sign that it is in the accusative case is a <em>kasrah</em> in place of a <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah</em>, because it is joined to a sound feminine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly creation and commandment are His alone </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Alaa</em></strong>”: is a term to draw attention and to affirm something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“For Him”: meaning He the Perfect and Most High, not for anyone else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Creation”: it is to bring something into existence, so He is the One Who is Fully Able to create whenever He wants to, He the Perfect and Most High, He creates whatever He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the command”: His command, He the Perfect and Most High, and it is His speech, He the Perfect and Most High, His creational command and His legislational command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Creational Command:</strong> that which He has commanded the created beings with and they obey Him in it and respond to Him, such as His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلْأَرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعًا أَوْ كَرْهًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So He said to it </strong>(the heavens)<strong> and to the earth, come about both of you willingly or unwillingly </strong></span>[41:11]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He commanded the two of them He the Perfect, and this was a creational command which He commanded the heavens and the earth with, so they came into being.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His command is just that when He wants something He says to it “Be!”, and it is.</strong></span> [36:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allaah’s Creational Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for His Legislational Command: </strong>then it is His revelation which was sent down by which He commands His servants. He commands them to worship Him, He commands them with the prayer, He commands them with the <em>Zakaat</em>, He commands them with dutifulness to the parents, this is His Legislational Command. Entering into it are His commands and prohibitions which are in the honourable Qur’aan and in the Prophetic <em>Sunnah</em>. This is from the command of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since creation and commandment are for Him, then what remains for other than Him, He the Perfect and Most High? And therefore Ibn ‘Umar said when he recited this <em>aayah</em>, “Whoever has  something then let him seek after it”. And the <em>aayah</em> proves the difference between creating and commanding, so it contains a refutation of those who say that the Qur’aan is created, because the Qur’aan is from the command, and Allaah’s command is not a created thing, since Allaah made a difference between creating and between commanding. So He made them two separate things, and the Qur’aan enters into His command, so it is not something created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what Imaam Ahmad used to overcome the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> in argument when they requested from him that he should say that the Qur’aan was something created. He said, “Is the Qur’aan from the creation or from the command?” They responded, “<strong>The Qur’aan is from His command</strong>.” He said, “The command is something different to the creation. Allaah made a difference between this and between the creation. So He made the creation one thing and His command something else.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The command is His speech, and as for the creation then it is His bringing into existance and making something. There is a difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Tabaarak Allaah</em></strong></span>”: means: tremendously great is the One whose actions are these, He the Perfect and Most High. And whose Ability is such and these are the things which He has created, He the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“<em>Tabaarak</em>”</strong></span>: is a verb which is used specifically for Him, He the Perfect, so it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him. And <em>al-Barakah</em> (blessing) it means abundance of good and its increase, and the blessings which come from Allaah the Majestic and Most High do not end. As for a created being, it cannot be said about him, “<em>tabaarak</em>”. Rather it can be said to him, “<em>mubaarak</em>” meaning, “May you receive blessing”, meaning may Allaah put blessing into him and make him blessed. And all blessing is from Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Lord of the whole of creation</strong>”: just as preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> contains affirmation of <em>at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s right to worship, as has preceded.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proof for His Lordship and His Divinity and Right to All Worship, He the Perfect and Most High</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37] <sup>7</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and <em>Ilaahiyyah</em> (Divinity and Right to Worship), He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun and the moon: the sun is the tremedous star which gives light to the creation, as a lamp burning and shining, just as Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have made it</strong></span> <span style="color:#008000;">(the sun)<strong> a lamp, burning and shining.</strong></span> [78:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the moon is a light which brightens the night-time and gives light to the pathway of the people. And from their benefits also is the well-being of the creation through its trees and its fruits and oceans. So if the sun were hidden away from the creation, then the creation would suffer harm, and many of the means of livelihood and their welfare would be corrupted and if the moon were hidden away, then likewise. The moon also brings about benefit for their fruits and their trees, along with what it contains also from awareness of reckoning (of time periods). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We made the moon a light and appointed set phases for it so that you should know the number of years and the reckoning of the months days and hours. </strong></span>[10:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons, then say: They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj </strong></span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the crescent moons bring benefit for awareness of time-periods and deadlines, deadlines for debts and deadlines for the waiting periods of the women, and the set times for acts of worship and fasting and Hajj, all of them are known by reckoning based upon these two lights, the sun and the moon. So the solar reckoning and the lunar reckoning contain many benefits for all of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from those things which He has created are the seven heavens. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنَ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who created seven heavens, and their like from the earth. </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah the One Who created seven heavens in levels </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(one above the other)</span> [67:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each being above the other, the lowest heaven, then the one which follows it up until the seventh one. And above them all is the Throne of the Most Merciful, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the earths are seven just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their like from the earth </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are seven levels or layers also, and every level from the levels of the seven heavens and the earths have inhabitants and occupants. And whatever planets and stars are in the heavens the sun and the moon and whatever is in the earth from created things from animals with their different types and from mountains and trees and rocks and minerals and oceans. These are from the signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the creational signs, which are seen and witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His signs is the night: meaning from His signs which prove Lordship and His Ability and His sole right to worship to the exclusion of all else besides Him, is the night which brings darkness, and the daytime which brings light to the whole of the creation. This is from the amazing signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who can make the whole of the creation dark, all at once, and then make the whole of the creation bright, all at once? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. If all of the creation were to gather together to make one part of the earth bright, they would not be able except to make a restricted area bright, if they brought all the electrical generators which are in the world, all of them, they could not make bright except a restricted portion of the earth. As for the sun and the moon then they bring light to the whole of the earth, the night and the day follow each other in succession, and the sun and the moon likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship. </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a nullification of <em>shirk</em>: Do not prostrate to created things. Since from the greatest of the created things are the sun and the moon, and because the people of shirk, they used to worship the sun and prostrate to it, and from them were those who used to worship the moon and the stars, such as the people of Ibraaheem, they would build for them temples in the form of the stars and they would worship them. So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not prostrate to the sun</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>As-Sujood</em> means placing the forehead upon the ground in humble submission to the one who is worshipped, and it is the greatest of the types of worship, and Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أقرب ما يكون العبد من ربه وهو ساجد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The closest that the servant comes to his Lord is whilst he is in prostration” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Reported by Muslim (482) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>. [And the narration of Muslim has a completion at the end, “So therefore make plentiful supplication.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the greatest of the types of worship is prostration upon the ground, since your face is the thing which you cherish the most, you have placed it for Allaah upon the ground, as an act of worship for Allaah and in submission before Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is true prostration, and it is not befitting to perform it as worship except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for prostrating to the sun and the moon, then it is prostration to a created thing, which does not have the right to be prostrated to. So it is not permissible to prostrate to created things, but rather prostration is only for the Creator of the created things. As for the created things, then they are just like you, something created, something managed and controlled. Would you prostrate to a created being who is incapable, just the same as you? This is not permissible. Where have the intellects gone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prostration is only deserved by the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, who is not rendered incapable by anything. So prostration is the right of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, it is not the right of the creation, no matter how great and large the created being is, it is still a created being who is weak and managed and controlled.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship.</strong></span> [41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we do not worship except Allaah. So if you make prostration to Him and you also prostrate to other than Him, then you are not worshippers of Allaah with correct worship. Rather you are worshipping Him along with <em>shirk</em>, and <em>shirk</em> corrupts and destroys worship.</p>

<p><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 17 Part B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F434998365&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/if-it-is-said-to-you-how-did-you-come-to-know-of-your-lord" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذَا قيلَ لكَ بما عرفْتَ ربَّك؟ فقُل بآياتِه ومخلوقاتِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “How did you come to know of your Lord”, then say, “through His Signs and those things which He has created” </strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have said, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, or, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah Who nurtured me with His favours</strong>”. So what is the proof that Allaah is your Lord who nurtured you with His favours? So the Shaikh brought proofs from the revelation and from the intellect as will follow. So if it is said to you, “<strong>How did you come to know of your Lord?”</strong>, because whoever claims something, then he must establish proof upon his claim:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And claims if the people do not establish proof</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> For them, then their people are mere claimants</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who makes a claim must establish the proof for his claim, otherwise his claim will not be correct. You have said, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation through His favours</strong>”. What is the proof? Then say, “<strong>The proof is His Signs and those things which He has created</strong>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Aayaat</em> is the plural of <em>aayah </em>and the word <em>aayah</em> in the language is a sign showing something and indicating something, just as he <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">آية المنافق ثلاث</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em>aayah</em> (sign) of the hypocrite is in three”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (33) and by Muslim (59) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning his sign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>through His Signs</strong></span>”: meaning the Signs and the proofs which indicate Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So all of these created beings which you see, all of them were non-existent, and then Allaah produced them and created them by His Ability, He the Perfect and Most High. And from them are created beings which are constantly renewed such as plants and the newborn, and things which were not present and then they came about, and you look upon them – who is the one who created them? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Do they create themselves?, did anyone from mankind create them? No-one can claim this, and no-one is able to claim it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or were they created without any creator, or are they themselves the creators, or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather they do not have certain faith </strong></span>[52:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These things did not produce themselves, nor were they produced by others from the created beings at all, and no-one can ever create a tree or a gnat or a fly:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those whom you call upon besides Allaah, they can never create even a fly, even if they gathered together to do it</span> </strong>[22:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this creation proves the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore, <span style="color:#333399;">when it was said unexpectedly to the bedouin man, “How did you come to know about your Lord?”. He responded, “The piece of camel dung proves that there is a camel, and the footprint proves that there is a man who is travelling. Does not this creation prove, the One Who is Subtle and Kind, the One Who is All-Aware?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you see a footprint upon the ground, does it not prove to you that someone has walked upon this ground, if you see a piece of camel dung does it not prove to you that there are camels upon this land or that a camel has passed by? A piece of camel dung proves that there has been a camel, and a footprint prove that somebody has passed by.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومِنْ آياتِه الليلُ والنهارُ والشمسُ والقمرُ، ومِنْ مخلوقاتِه السمواتُ السَّبْعُ والأَرْضُونَ السَّبع ومَا فيهنَّ وما بينهما</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and from that which He has created are the seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is within them and whatever is between them.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">6</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon</strong>”: so the <em>aayaat</em> (Signs) are of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>Ayaatun Kawniyyah</em></span></strong>, His Signs within the creation which we can see, such as the heavens and the earth and the stars and the sun and the moon and the mountains and the trees and the oceans. They are called Signs because they contain signs proving their Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore poet Abul-Ataahiyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>So how strange, how can the One deserving worship be disobeyed</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Or how can the one who denies deny Him?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> </em><em>When everything contains a Sign for Him</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> Proving that He is One</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And there is a witness for Allaah in every movement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> And every stillness of the creation</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can anyone deny Allaah the Majestic and Most High and saying there is no Lord for this whole creation, and that these created beings came about without any creator. And if they did come about through a creator, then who is this creator besides Allaah the Majestic and Most High, explain to me. You will not find a creator besides Allaah the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation so that the creation is obscured for them. Say: Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overwhelming Subduer </strong></span>[13:16]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaniyyah</em></span></strong>, <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan which are recited from the revelation which has been sent down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>all of these prove the existence of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and His Perfection and His Attributes and His Names, and that He is the One deserving of worship, He alone with no partner, all of them prove that, the creational Signs and the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creational Signs prove their Creator, and the One Who brought them into existence and the One Who controls them. And the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan contain the command to worship Allaah and they contain affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship and using it as a proof for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship. And the command to worship Allaah the Perfect and Most High, all of the Qur’aan is concentrated upon this meaning and it was sent down for this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon, these are from the greatest Signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the dark night which covers this creation, and the bright day which brings light to this creation, so that they can go about for their work. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ اللَّيْلَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِضِيَاءٍ ۖ أَفَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ النَّهَارَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِلَيْلٍ تَسْكُنُونَ فِيهِ ۖ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُوا فِيهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Do you see if Allaah made the night continuous upon you until the Day of Resurrection, what deity besides Allaah could bring you light? Will you not then listen? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Do you see if Allaah made the day continuous upon you until the Day of Resurrection, what deity besides Allaah could bring you night-time in which you could rest? Will you not see? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His Mercy upon you is that He has made the night and the day so that you may rest therein and seek of His bounty and that you should be thankful. </strong></span>[28:71-73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the greatest of the Signs of Allaah, this night and this day. The whole time is not night and the whole of time is not day, because if that were the case then the welfare of the people would be lost and they would become fatigued.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah made the night and the day to follow each other in succession for them and then the night and the day are ordered, neither of them clashes nor do they alter, upon a single ordered system which proves the wisdom of the All-Wise One, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants and that which they make end in destruction, and they clash with each other whatever they may be and they stop working.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the things created by Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then they do not become destroyed, except at the time when Allaah permits their destruction. So the night and the day continue, neither of them ceases working, whereas things made by the creation stop working and come to destruction and perish no matter how strong they are and how large they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how many abandoned cars do you see and planes and ships even though they were strong and had been taken care of, yet they end in destruction and they stop working. Does the night-time stop working or does the day-time stop working? No, because its maker has full Ability and is All-Wise, He the Majestic and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">صُنْعَ اللَّهِ الَّذِي أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The creation of Allaah who has made everything firmly and precisely. </strong></span>[27:88]</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وكلُّ ما سِوَى اللهِ عالََمٌ وأنا واحدٌ من ذلكَ العالَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings.</strong></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullah</em>, explained the manner in which this <em>aayah</em> is used as an evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings</strong>.”: so therefore Allaah is my Lord, because Allaah is the Lord of all of the created beings and I am one of the created beings. So no-one is able to say, “I have a lord besides the Lord of the creation”, neither an unbeliever nor a Muslim. This will not be possible ever and no person with intellect will say it. This is a proof for the <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and since He is the Lord of the whole of the creation, then therefore He is the One deserving worship, and this nullifies the worship of others besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore after it He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You alone do we worship and Your aid alone do we seek. </strong></span>[1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates restriction, because the fact that the governed word is brought forward, “<em>Iyyaaka</em>”, and the governing verb <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>نَعْبُدُ</strong> </span>is put back, indicates restriction. So, “You, we worship”, is different to, “we worship you”, because saying, “we worship”, this is merely affirmation. However, “You, we worship”, this includes negation and affirmation, meaning, “we do not worship anyone else besides you”. And worship will not be correct except with negation and affirmation, and it is the meaning of <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, for it contains negation and affirmation, a negation for the right to be worshipped from everything else besides Allaah, and affirmation of it for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p>Previous Class: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/23/three-fundamental-principles-which-must-be-known/">These Three Fundamental Principles have Tremendous Importance</a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذا قيلَ لكَ: مَنْ رَبُّكَ؟ فقلْ ربي اللهُ الذي ربّاني ورَبَّى جميعَ العالمينَ بنعمِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>So if it is said to you, “Who is your Lord?”, then say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and all of the creation with His favours.”</b></span></span><b> </b><strong><sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> having explained the three fundamental principles in general terms, wanted to explain them in detail one by one, with their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, and from Allaah’s signs within the creation, and from the intellectual evidences. And it is likewise obligatory to base creed and belief upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah, and upon examination of the signs which Allaah has placed within the creation so that it should be firmly grounded and firmly established in the heart and so that all doubts are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for creed and beliefs based upon <em>shubuhaat</em> (incorrect suspicions) and upon doubts and upon sayings of the people and upon blind-following, then these will be beliefs which are short-lived and will not remain firmly established, and they will be open to being disproven and they will be open to being totally refuted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So creed and belief and the rest of the rulings of the legislation are not established except with proofs of the Book and the Sunnah and with accepted intellectual proofs. And therefore the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> he quoted many proofs for these three fundamental principles, so no principle from them occurs except that he has support it with evidences and proofs about which there is certainty which repel doubts and false desires and which firmly implant the creed and belief in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong>So if it is said to you</strong>”: meaning if you are asked about your Lord, and this is a question which will occur, you will be indeed asked about it in this world and in the hereafter, so it is essential that you have knowledge of your Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and that you respond with the correct response based upon <strong>certainty</strong> and <strong>clear proof</strong>. So then say, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, this is the answer, “<strong>the One Who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation with His favours</strong>.” This is using an intellectual proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>, the Lord the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who nurtures all of His servants with His favours and nourishes them with the provision which He gives. He creates them after they were previously nothing mentioned, they were in the wombs of their mothers, in one form of creation after another within three depths of darkness. And He causes provision to reach them, even in the wombs of their mothers, and therefore the body of the fetus develops in the womb of the mother and grows larger, because the provision from Allaah the Perfect and Most High reaches it and nourishment reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the soul is breathed into it so it moves and it comes to life, by the permission of Allaah. This is <em>tarbiyyah</em> (nurturing) in the womb. Then when it comes out, then Allaah the Perfect nurtures it with His favours giving it health and well-being and He causes the milk of its mother to flow for it, so it is nourished until it can eat food and can do without milk. Then little by little its intellect grows and its hearing and seeing develops, it develops little by little until it reaches puberty then it develops further until it reaches its full strength, until it reaches forty years old and it is at the limit of its strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who is it that nourishes it from the day when He created it in the womb of its mother until it dies, who is it who nourishes it, then who is it who causes this food and this drink to be digested and absorbed in its body so that it reaches every cell and every muscle and every place in its body, who is it who makes food and drink appetizing for it, who is it who causes that to pass through and who removes what is harmful from it, who is it who does this and nurtures this human being, is it not Allaah the Perfect and Most High? This is the Lord the Perfect and Most High, the one who nurtures, He is the one who nurtured me and nurtured all of the created beings by His favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything upon the face of the earth from the realms of humans and animals and the realm of the land and the sea, from the greatest created thing to the smallest created thing upon the land and the sea, all of them are nourished by His favours and His provision. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or who is it that could give you provision if your Lord were to withold the provision which He gives to you?</span> </strong>[67:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is no creature upon the earth except that its provision is dependent upon Allaah and He knows its dwelling place and its resting place.</span> </strong>[11:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And how many a creature there is which does not carry its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</span> </strong>[29:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Lord, the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That is Allaah your Lord so worship Him alone.</span> </strong>[10:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then it does not possess and have ability over anything from that, neither the idols nor anything else, no-one else possesses and has ability over granting provision, rather it is one who is provided for, it is a created being like yourself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And He is the One Whom I worship and there is no other whom I worship besides Him, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[1:2]<strong> <sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: the Lord, the One who is like this He is the One who deserves worship from me and from other than me. Then the Shaikh also draws attention to the fact that it is not sufficient to affirm <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Allaah’s Lordship), it is not sufficient that you say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me with His favours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not sufficient, you must acknowledge His right to all worship, and you must make all worship purely and sincerely for Him. And this is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. So the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> affirms the Lordship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and he affirms His sole right to worship, He alone with no partner, whereas the person of <em>shirk, </em>he affirms the Lordship of Allaah, however he is one who associates others along with Him in his worship of Him. He associates along with Him those who do not create and do not provide provision and do not possess anything. This is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. The person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> says, “My Lord is Allaah and He is the One Whom I worship, and I have no other one whom I worship besides Him.”, whereas the person of <em>shirk</em>, he says, “My Lord is Allaah.” However worship with him is not solely for Allaah, so he worships along with Allaah, trees and rocks and beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people and graves. So he becomes a person of <em>shirk</em>, and the affirmation of Lordship does not benefit him, and it does not enter him into Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: meaning the Deity Whom I worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And I have no other whom I worship besides Him</strong>”: neither from the Angels nor from the Messengers nor from the righteous people nor from trees nor rocks nor anything else, I have nothing which I worship besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> with the proof, and this is an intellectual proof, and then he mentioned the textual proof the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All Praise is for Allaah, the Lord and Nurturer of the whole of the creation.</span> </strong>[1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is the start of the Qur’aan in the <em>Mus-haf </em>(written copy of the Qur’aan), there is nothing before it except for, “In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.” And it is the conclusion of the speech of the people of Paradise, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the conclusion of their call will be that all Praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[10:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Majestic and Most High began this creation with this phrase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَاتِ وَالنُّورَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah He Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light.</span> </strong>[6:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He will conclude the creation with it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And judgement will be passed upon them all with justice, and judgement will be concluded by its being said that all praise is for Allaah the Lord of creation</span> </strong>[39:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He began the creation with it and He concluded with it, so it is a tremendous saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying He the Most High, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”</strong></span>: it is praise of the One Who is being praised along with love of Him and veneration of Him. And the, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”, is to make it totally comprehensive, meaning all praise is for Allaah, it belongs to Him and He is deserving of it, so He is the One Who deserves total and unrestricted praise. As for other than him, then he can be praised in accordance with the level of the fine and good things which he does. As for total and unrestricted and complete praise then it is for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because favours, all of them are from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even the created being if he does something good to you, then it is from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He is the One Who caused this created being to do something useful for you, and He is the One Who enabled him to do good for you, so indeed praise returns to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Lillaah</em></span></strong>”: the <em>jaar</em> and the <em>majroor</em> are connected to something left unmentioned which is the predicate for the subject. So the phrase means: praise exists or is confirmed for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah</strong></span>”: means, the One possessing Divinity and the right to be worshipped over the whole of His creation. And this Name, no-one else besides Him, He the Perfect can be called it, no-one can be called Allaah. Even the Pharoah, he did not say, “I am Allaah”, rather he said, “I am your Lord”. So this Name is particular to Allaah, no-one can ever be called it, and no-one has the audacity to say, “I am Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabbi</em></span></strong>”: this is a qualifying noun for Allaah’s Name, and it is in the genitive case and it is a governing noun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”: is a governed noun in the genitive case, and the sign that it is in the genitive case is the, “<em>yaa</em>”. Because it it joined to the sound masculine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that praise, all of it, and extolling, all of it, is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the world of the Angels and the world of inanimate objects and of birds and the world of beasts of prey and the world of animals and the world of insects and of ants and the many worlds or realms of creation that there are upon the land and in the sea, they are not known except to Allaah, and no-one can enumerate them except Allaah. All of them, Allaah is their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”, (the Lord of all of the creation): this cannot be applied except to Allaah the Perfect the Mighty and Majestic. It is not possible for anyone to be called, “<em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it said, “<strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>”, (<em>The</em> Lord): then this cannot be used except for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, it cannot be used except for Him. As for a created being, then the term can be used restrictedly so that it is said, <em>Rabb-ad-Daar</em> “the master of the house”, or, “the owner of the animal”, meaning its owner and its master.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ مَعْرِفَةُ اللهِ ، <sup> </sup>وَمَعْرِفَةُ نَبِيِّهِ <sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup> </sup>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Prophet<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah</strong>”: How does the servant come to have knowledge and awareness of his Lord? He knows of Him through His Signs and His created things, so from His Signs are the night and the day, and from those things which He has created are the sun and the moon, as will be explained later on <em>inshaa’ Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He knows of Allaah by means of His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Kawneeyah</em></strong> (Signs within the creation) and His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaneeyah</em></strong> (The aayahs of His Qur’aan). If he recites the Qur’aan, then He knows that Allaah the Perfect and Most High – He is the One who created the heavens and the earth and that He is the One who made subservient whatever is within the heavens and the earth, and that He is the One who gives life and gives death, and that He has full Ability over everything, and that He is <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan </em>the Extremely Merciful One, and <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>eem</em> the One Who bestows mercy. So the Qur’aan provides knowledge and awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that He is the One Who bestowed all favours upon us, and that He is the One who created us and gives us provision, so if you recite the Qur’aan, then you will know your Lord, the Perfect and Most High, by way of His Names and His Attributes and His Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you look into the creation, then you will know and be aware of your Lord, the Perfect and Most High – that He is the One Who created this creation, and who made this creation subservient, and Who caused it to proceed by His Wisdom and His Knowledge – He the Perfect and Most High; this is knowledge of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And knowledge of His Prophet</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, because he was the one who conveyed the message from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, he is the intermediary between us and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to conveying the message, so therefore it is essential that you know him, you know who he is, and you know his lineage, and you know his city, and you know that which he <em>sallallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em> came with. That you know how the revelation first came to him, and how he established the call to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in Makkah and in Al-Madeenah. That you know the life history of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam </em> even if it is in abridged form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad the son of ‘Abdullaah, the son of ‘Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haashim, the son of ‘Abd-Manaaf, all the way to the end of the noble Prophetic lineage, which goes all the way back to Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. And you know how he lived before he was raised as a Prophet, and how the revelation came to him from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and what did he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> do after his being raised as a Prophet – you know that through study of his <em>seerah </em>(of his life), and it is not befitting for the Muslim that he should be ignorant of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. For how can you follow a person when you do not have knowledge of him? This cannot be comprehended.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَعْرِفَةُ دِينِ الإِسْلامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And knowledge of the religion of Islaam<sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Knowledge of the religion of Islaam</strong>”: which is the religion of this Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. Indeed, it is the religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which He commanded His servants with, and which He commanded you to follow, and you are required to follow it, so you must have knowledge and awareness of this religion. And Islaam is the religion of all of the Messengers. All of the Messengers, their religion was Islaam, with the general meaning. So everyone who followed a Messenger from the Messengers, then he is a Muslim, one who submits in Islaam to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, one who submitted to Him and one who singled Him out with all worship – this is Islaam with the general meaning, that it is the religion of all the Messengers. So Islaam is:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الاستسلام لله بالتوحيد والانقياد له بالطاعة والخلوص من الشرك وأهله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To submit to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and to comply to Him with obedience, and remaining free of <em>shirk</em> and its people”</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Islaam with the specific meaning, then it is that which Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> with, since after the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> then there is no religion except for his religion <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatuwassalaam. </em>And Islaam is confined to following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>so it is not possible for a Jew to now say, “I am a Muslim”, or a Christian to say, “I am a Muslim”, after the sending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>if he does not follow him. So Islaam, after the sending of the Prophet, is following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam. </em>He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: If you people truly love Allaah, then follow Me, then Allaah will love you [3:31]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Islaam with its general meaning and with its specific meaning.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">بِالأَدِلَّةِ<sup>    </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">With the proofs.<sup>7</sup></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “With the proofs”: not due to <em>taqleed</em> (blind following), but rather with the proofs from the Qur’aan and from the Sunnah – this is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is Allaah said, His Prophet said,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          The Companions said – they are the possessors of knowledge and awareness</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is not that you foolishly raise up a disagreement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          Between the Messenger and the opinion of so-and-so.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is knowledge, knowledge is the knowledge contained in the Book and the Sunnah. As for the sayings of the <em>’ulemaa</em> (the scholars), then they only explain and clarify the speech of Allaah and the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>and some of them may contain a mistake, and the proofs are not the speech of the <em>’ulemaa</em>, rather the proofs are the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>adeeth</em>. As for the speech of scholars, then it explains and clarifies that, except it is not a proof in itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the first matter, and it is the foundation, the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> began with it because it is the foundation, and one should begin with <em>‘aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and with the foundation in learning, and in teaching, and in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. <em>‘Aqeedah</em> should be begun with, because it is the fundamental basis, and it is the foundation.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-saysmy-recital-of-the-quran-is-created-then-he-is-a-jahmi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah affirmed speech; <em>al-Kalaam</em> for Himself in many <em>aayahs</em>, from them is the saying; He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If the water of the ocean were ink to write down the words of My Lord then the ocean would be exhausted before the words of My Lord were finished&#8230;”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah</em> 109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the words of Allaah with which He commands and forbids and manages the creation with. Who can then enumerate the words of Allaah, He, the Perfect and Most High? They could not be written down by the oceans nor by all of the pens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the speech of Allaah, the <em>Kalaam</em> is as said by the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to its type; eternal, with respect to its individual instances, it newly comes about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Qadeemun-Nau`</em> means that Allaah, the Most High has always had the attribute of speech. However, with regard to individual instances, for example, Allaah, the Most High speaking to Aadam or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Moosaa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or speaking to Jibreel with the <em>Qur·aan</em> then these individual instances of the speech of Allaah; they newly occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is from the newly occurring instances of the speech of Allaah and some individual instances of the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of Allaah is confirmed by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And there is no doubt that sound intellect affirms speech for Allaah because it is <em><u>S</u>ifatul Kamaal</em> (hidden attribute of perfection) and negation of it is an attribute of deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan who was a foul person who appeared amongst the people and tried to cause them to doubt about the religion of Allaah and he commanded them with apostasy and disbelief. And from that is that he tried to cause them to doubt about the fact that Allaah speaks and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The speech of Allaah which is present is something created; <em>makhlooq</em>. He created it in the Preserved Tablet or He created it in Jibreel or He created it in Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is therefore just an ascription of a created thing to its creator just like saying <em>Baitullaah</em> (the House of Allaah) or <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (the she camel of Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said  ̶ may Allaah disfigure him. He said Allaah does not speak and the ascription of speech to Him is just an ascription of a created thing to its Creator. This is from his <em>mathhab</em> (position). And he also had the position of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Jabr</em> with regard to <em>Qadr</em> (predecree); that people are compelled to do their deeds, no free will. And he had the position of with regard to denying the names and attributes and he also had a position with regard to denying the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the <em>Qur·aan</em> also. So he was a filthy apostate who appeared with the likes of this falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>mathhab</em> was derived from the Jews as was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah in the introduction to <em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>. And Al-Jahm, he was not the one who began this <em>mathhab</em>. Before him, there was Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham; he is the one who initiated this repulsive saying. And he took it from <u>T</u>aaloot; the Jew and <u>T</u>aaloot took it from Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am, the Jew who did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this saying is derived from the Jews, those who distort the speech of Allaah, away from its correct meaning, so this foul <em>mathhab</em> should not be considered something inexplicable when its source is known that it is from the Jews. They infiltrated it amongst the Muslims by means of this foul man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham, the one who was killed by Khaalid al-Qasree on the Day of <em>Eid ul-A<u>d</u>haa</em> as Ibn-ul Qayyim mentioned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[1]</span></a> So therefore Ibn-ul Qayyim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>And on account of that, Khaalid Al–Qasree slaughtered </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ja`ad on the Day of the Sacrifice </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Since he said Ibraaheem was not Allaah’s chosen beloved one</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>No, and nor was Moosaa one who He spoke to and drew close </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>So every person of Sunnah is thanked for that sacrifice</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">What an excellent thing Allaah has brought about through the sacrifice of this brother</span> </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[2]</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was taken from him by Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and it became ascribed to him because he is the one who propagated it but he is not the one who initiated it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of the Sunnah rebuked and criticized them severely (the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>). And they spoke sternly in that regard and this will follow inshaaAllaah, the part that comes after. However, with us now we have a part of this foul <em>mathhab</em>, which is negation of speech for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a problem arose with the People of the <em>Sunnah</em>, should it be said, “My recital of the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is created or is not created?” This is something which they introduced also amongst the Muslims. So should you say: “My recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created or should you say my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is not created or should you <em>tatawaqqaf</em> (withhold)? And say if what you mean is what is recited, that which is recited, then it is the speech of Allaah, it is not created. And if what is meant is a person’s own particular recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> then his own recital is a created thing and his voice is created. So therefore it must be mentioned with detail and it must be given then with detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the detail, which was stated by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bukhaariyy and a group of the verifiers. So do not say: my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created unrestricted and do not say it’s not created unrestrictedly and do not withhold. Rather, mention the answer with detail that <span style="color:#333399;">if what you mean is what I’m reciting then that is the speech of Allaah, that is not created or if what is meant is the person’s own particular recitation, his own particular voice then that is created. That is the detail</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side-point: And he quotes three famous lines from the Nooniyyah of Ibn-ul Qayyim, poem on `<em>aqeedah</em>, each line ending in <em>noon</em>, concerning this event that this man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham that he was killed by Khaalid Al-Qasree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side-point: They mention this happened around the year 118 AH in Kufa that Khaalid Al-Qasree who was the governor in Iraq at that time that he slaughtered this evil person Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side-point: Some of the people of Knowledge mention is that this saying that we heard was taken by Jahm from Al-Ja`ad and he took it from Taaloot and he took it from Labeed. Then this Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am was a Jew. As we heard he did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his saying was taken from him by Taaloot; the Jew and from him, his student Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham took this saying, the saying of the Jahmiyyah. And from Al-Ja`ad was taken by his student Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and each was executed. We saw Al-Ja`ad being executed here and likewise Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, he was killed as well; his student but before that, each time before the person was executed or killed, he had a famous student who took the saying from him. So, Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, this saying was taken from him by Bishr al-Marisee and then he, Bishr al-Marisee, he taught this to A<u>h</u>mad ibn Abee Du`aad, the one who was at the head of those who tortured Imaam A<u>h</u>mad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just briefly with regard to the event; before the event that Khalid al-Qasree slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham on the Day of Sacrifices. He gave a <em>khutbah</em> to the people on the `<em>Eid</em> and he said: May Allaah accept your sacrifices for indeed I am going to sacrifice Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham and he came down and he slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this report: “There’s some speech from the scholars, is it established or not? This is reported by a number of the scholars in their books Ad-Daarimee in <em>Ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em> and Al-Bukhaariyy in his book <em>Khalq Af`alul-`Ibaad</em> and other books as well. Then Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>Mukhta<u>s</u>ar al-`Uluw</em>, Ath-Thahabee’s book <em>Al `Uluw</em>, the originate of it, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy comments, he mentions that the first chain of narration for this that there is weakness in it, there is unknown people in the chain. But then he said, however, the narration that comes after it, another narration with a different chain is better than it and perhaps therefore that is why the scholars state that this story definitely happened. Meaning, there is more than one chain of narration before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Translator’s side-point:  With regard to the explanation of Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after mentioning a number of evidences from the <em>Qur·aan</em> affirming that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is indeed the speech of Allaah, not created and the speech of Allaah is an attribute of His. Then he said: ‘And whoever says that anything from the attributes of Allaah is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> have affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Al-Laalikaa’ee referring to here Imaam Al–Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; famous book of `<em>aqeedah</em> mentioned from 550 scholars from the <em>Salaf</em> that they said: ‘Whoever says that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and whoever says that his recitation of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is something created then he is an innovator, a <em>Jahmi</em> (he is astray). And likewise, one who remains silent and doesn’t say whether it’s created or not created, he is also a <em>Jahmi</em> (astray). So what Allaah has informed is very clear that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is the speech of Allaah and whoever will not say that then he has belied Allaah in what He has informed of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s side point: Obviously the last part of the text here is taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times, <strong><em>“Whoever lives long amongst you will see great differing</em></strong>…<strong>”</strong> and the rest of the point taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Al-Irbaa<u>d</u> Ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, Abu Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is <em>al-Qaahir</em></strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is <strong>dominant</strong> over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who <strong>subdued</strong> all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحْمَان</strong> <strong><em>Ar-Rahmaan</em></strong> (the Extremely Merciful), the Merciful One Who has as His attribute mercy, the One possessing tremendous and extensive mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحِيم</strong>  <strong><em>Ar-Raheem</em></strong> (the Bestower of mercy), the One Who has mercy upon the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the verifier has mentioned, the difference between <em>Ar-Rahmaan </em>and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> is with regard to the attribute of Allaah’s self, the attribute He has Himself of extreme mercy and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is His bestowing mercy upon the creation with regard to His action.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>ar-Rahmaan</strong></em> (The One Who is Most Merciful): This is one of Allaah’s particular names and which denotes the attribute of very great and extensive mercy that exists with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[<span style="color:#808080;">See Ibnul Qayyim’s Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul Khayr, 1st. ed. 1414/1994)], vol. 1, pp. 23-24, and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s Sharhul <em>‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, ibid.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ar-Raheem</strong> (The One Who Bestows Mercy): This name denotes that the attribute is related to the <em>marhoom</em> (i.e. the one whom Allaah chooses to receive His <em>Rahmah</em> (Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the difference between <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> and ar-Raheem is that in the case of the former, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His attribute, and in the latter, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His act, meaning that He is the One Who bestows <em>ar-Rahmah</em> upon others. So, when both names come together [i.e. <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>ar-Raheem</em>], then the meaning in this context is that Allaah’s Mercy is very great and extensive, and that His Mercy reaches His creation. This is what is meant by those who say that <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> is the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything (general Mercy), and <em>ar-Raheem</em> is the One who has Mercy upon the believers (special Mercy). Since Allaah’s Mercy upon the <em>kaafir</em> is a special one in this life only, then it is as if they have no mercy upon them, because in the Hereafter when they will ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to save them from Hell and admit being wrong, Allaah will deal with them with His Justice, not His Mercy, Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اخْسَئُوا فِيهَا وَلَا تُكَلِّمُونِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Remain you in it [Hell] with ignominy! And speak not to Me!”</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:108)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name <em>ar-Raheem</em> is applied to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and may be applied to others. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has described His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as <em>Raheem</em> (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:128).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (رحمه االله) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the names of Allaah تعالى are restricted to Him only like the names: Allaah, <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>al-Khaaliq</em>, <em>ar-Raaziq</em> and so forth. Some other names, however, may be applied to other than Him.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id</em>, p. 24, <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, pp. 38-39, <em>Lum’atul I’tiqaad</em>, p. 29, <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (1:21), <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> within Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa</em> (Riyadh, KSA: Daar Ath-Thuraya, 1st. ed. 1414/1993)], vol. 6, p. 11.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Six</strong>]: In the sixth statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pronoun of the verb { <strong>يُحِيطُونَ </strong>}<strong> &#8220;compass</strong>” refers to either all that is in the heavens and the earth or to the letter haa’ (ـهـ) in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ <strong>مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong> ] “<strong>What happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past</strong>.” In the latter case, the meaning would be “Those who Allaah knows what happens to them in the future and what happened to them in the past, will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He Wills.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement, Allaah (تعالى) makes clear the perfection of His knowledge and the imperfection of the creature’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus, He (تعالى) compares His Attributes to that of His ‘<em>ibaad</em> in order that His perfection and the imperfection of the creatures become clearly evident. This is also clear in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whatsoever on it </strong>(the earth)<strong> will perish. And the Face of your <em>Rabb</em>, full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Rahmaan (55:26-27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as the word ‘<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>عِلْمِهِ </strong>]<br />
“<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His Knowledge</strong></span>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it is an infinitive (verbal noun) denoting either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) the ‘<em>ilm</em> of His <em>thaat</em> (Essence) and <em>sifaat</em> (Attributes), or<br />
(b) His <em>ma’loom</em> (What Allaah Knows).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the meaning of the aayah: {<strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong>} &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</strong></span>&#8220;, means either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) that we do not know anything about Allaah, His <em>thaat</em>, and His <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) that we do not know of what Allaah knows except that which He willed to be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayah implies both meanings, and both are correct since we do not know of Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> or <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know. Indeed, He is the One Who made it known to us that He ascended upon the ‘<em>arsh</em> (Throne); and He is the One Who taught us on the tongue of His Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم] that He descends to the lowest heaven [in the last third of the night]; and this is the case with the rest of His <em>sifaat</em>: We have no knowledge of them except that He wills. Similarly, what Allaah knows regarding what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, our knowledge thereof is restricted to that which He willed for us to know. After all, He is the One Who informed us of the existence of the angels in the heavens and that there are seven heavens. So it is with respect to the rest of what Allaah knows, we are aware of that which He willed for us to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even that which He has made known, many of us are unaware of it; the knowledge thereof are attained only if He wills. In the human being, there are many things which people [i.e. scientists] are not yet fully aware of. They gradually attained the knowledge that they knew not before. So, the aayah comprises both of the meanings discussed above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus we do not know anything of what Allaah knows even that which concerns ourselves except that which He wills, and that we do not compass anything about Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> and <em>sifaat</em> except that which He wills. Therefore, whatever Allaah wills for His creatures to know, whether in relation to His <em>thaat</em>, <em>sifaat</em>, <em>asmaa</em>’ (Names), or Actions; or with respect to His creation or His legal ways which He revealed to His Messengers, then He (تعالى) will make it known for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Five]: Then Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) said in the Fifth Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah Knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge, according to the scholars of <em>usool</em> (the fundamental principles of <em>deen</em>), is the definitive comprehension of a thing in conformity with its true nature.Thus, the lack of comprehension is ignorance, the indecisive comprehension is doubt, and the assertive comprehension that does not concur with reality is compounded ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if you were asked, “When did the expedition of Badr [59] take place?” And you say, “I do not know,” then this is <strong>ignorance</strong>. If you were asked the same question and you said, “It happened in the second or the third year of <em>hijrah</em>,” then this is <strong>doubt</strong>.[60] And if your answer to the same question was, “The fifth year,” then this is <strong>compounded ignorance</strong>.[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, knows things comprehensively and with perfection, overall and in detail. His knowledge is unlike the knowledge of ‘<em>ibaad</em>. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah knows what happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past.</span></strong>[62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conjunctive noun {<strong>ما</strong>} is a form of generalization (gram.) This comprises everything be it small or great, or whether it is from the actions of Allaah or from the creatures’ deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing what happens to them in the future implies that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is not unaware of the future, and that His knowledge of the past necessitates that He does not forget the past. That is why when Fir’awn said to Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>):</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَىٰ</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“What about the generations of the old?”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:51)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي فِي كِتَابٍ ۖ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّي وَلَا يَنسَى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The knowledge thereof is with my Rabb, in a Record. My Rabb is neither unaware nor He forgets.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:52)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is neither unaware of the future nor does He forget the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] The Battle of Badr occurred between the army of the believers lead by Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the polytheists of Quarysh and it took place on the 17th of Ramadaan of the second year of Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Because you give another answer, which you think has the same possibility of being the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] This is known as <em><strong>al-jahlul-murakkab</strong></em>, which is to comprehend something in a way contrary to its true reality. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> (Burmingham, UK: Al-Hidaayah Publication, 1st. ed. 1418/1997)], p. 37.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] This is one of the meanings of this great aayah. It signifies that Allaah’s knowledge encompasses everything in the past, present, and the future; nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Names of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العليم</strong> </span><strong>al-&#8216;Aleem</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The One Who knows what has been and what will be; Who ever has known, and ever will know, what has been and what will be; His knowledge comprehends all things, the covert and the overt, the small thereof and the great, the possible and the impossible, the lofty and lower spheres, etc. in the most complete manner. Nothing is concealed from Him in the earth or in the heavens.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seven]: Then Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over the heavens and the earth encompassing them all, He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>kursi</em> [literally: footstool] is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayn</em> (place of the Feet) of Allaah, Most Mighty and Most Majestic, and it is before the ‘<em>arsh</em> like a front to it. This was authentically related by ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) in a <em>mawqoof</em> [63] type of narration. This is agreed upon by the majority of <em>ahlussunnah wal jamaa’ah</em>. In fact, this is asserted by Shaykh-ulIslam Ibn Taymeeyah, [Imaam] Ibnul Qayyim, and others from the people of knowledge and from the verifying scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some have said that <em>al-kursi</em> is the ‘<em>arsh</em> itself. However, this is not true because the ‘<em>arsh</em> is greater, more spacious, and more profound in its extent of encompassing than <em>al-kursi</em>. It has also been narrated on the authority of ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) that <em>al-kursi</em> represents Allaah’s Knowledge. But I do not think that this narration is authentic because this meaning (i.e. knowledge) is not the true meaning for the word al-kursi in the classical Arabic language nor in the common (‘urfi) language. In fact, it is very unlikely that this transmission from ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is an authentic one [64]. Hence, <em>al-kursi</em> is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatness of <em>al-kursi</em> is clearly stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The seven heavens and the seven earths by the side of <em>al-kursi</em> are naught but as a ring thrown down in a desert land, and such is <em>al-kursi</em> with respect to <em>al-’Arsh</em> (the Throne).”</strong></span> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the vastness of these immense creations and which are, with respect to us, from the world of <em>al-ghayb</em>. That is why Allaah سبحانه و تعالى says:</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not looked at the heavens above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:6)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He سبحانه و تعالى did not say: “<strong>Have they not looked at al-kursi (or al- ‘arsh)&#8230;</strong>,” because this is something that is not seen by us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had it not been that Allaah had informed us about it (<em>al-kursi</em> or <em>al-‘arsh</em>), we would not have known of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span>, supports the opinion held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and by other verifying scholars that the heavens and the earths all have a spherical shape, because this is a matter acknowledged by sensory perception, and through information, though the latter method may have been hidden from many of the preceding people. The proof for this from the Qur’aan is in the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When the heaven is split asunder [on the Day of Resurrection], and listens and obeys its Rabb,—and it must do so; And when the earth is stretched forth&#8230;</span></strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Inshiqaaq (84:1-3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when the earth is stretched forth,&#8221;</span> </strong>necessitates that it is now unstretched. In addition, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said that on the Day of Resurrection, the earth will be stretched forth like stretched leather, the example of which is drawn for emphasis. [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Yukawwiru</em> the night around the day </strong>[making it to be a covering upon the day]<strong> and <em>Yukawwiru</em> the day around the night.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:5)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Yukawiru</em> means: “to wind round,”[67] like in our saying, “the <em>akwaar</em> (singl. <em>kawr</em>) of the turban,” meaning the turns of the turban upon the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the day and night succeed each other upon earth and in doing so, this entails that the earth is spherical, because a thing would not be wound around in a round form except upon something ball-shaped. Nowadays, it is witnessed that the earth is spherical in form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that <em>al-kursi</em> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth is evidence that it is wound round in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding <em>al-‘arsh</em>, it has been reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described it as being like a dome above the heavens.[68] The dome-shape being round but neither fully spherical nor flat, and its middle is high like that of a tent. [69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah سبحانه و تعالى]<strong> feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them </strong>[i.e. the heavens and the earths]<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This attribute of Allaah [feeling no fatigue] is an Attribute of negation. So, what are the Attributes required for guarding and preserving [the heavens and the earths] such that we know that this negation [of fatigue] is in fact an affirmation of their perfection? It is essential that the guarding and preserving require Life, Knowledge, Ability, Might, Mercy, and possibly other attributes. What is important is that the negation implies the perfection of Allaah’s Knowledge, Ability, Might, and Mercy as well as the other related Attributes that are entailed by His (سبحانه و تعالى) preserving and guarding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] <em>Mawqoof</em>: lit. “stopped”. It is a narration from a companion only. The hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is called <em>marfoo</em>’. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) commented, “Had it not been that Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is one whom it is said that he takes from the Israelite transmissions (<em>israa’eeliyyaat</em>: narrations from the traditions of the People of the Book), we would have said that this transmission (regarding <em>al-kursi</em>) takes the form of <em>marfoo</em>’ tradition, because it deals with knowledge of <em>al-ghayb</em> (the world of unperceived realities). When it comes to this kind of knowledge, there is no room for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deductions). When a <em>sahaabi</em> (companion) says or does something which is not within the scope of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then it takes the <em>marfoo</em>’ type of tradition. The exception, however, is that if the narration from the <em>sahaabi</em> is of the form of <em>akhbaar</em> (news telling, relating information), then, if it is known that a <em>sahaabi</em> narrates from Bani Israa’eel, his transmission would not be <em>marfoo</em>’ because of the possibility that its source may be from Bani Israa’eel (an Israelite transmission). Knowing that the scholars are scrupulous in their inspection of what is attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), they do not rule that a particular transmission is <em>marfoo</em>’ except when all of the possibilities that may hinder this ruling are ruled out.” Tafseer Aayat Al-Kursi, pp. 19-20.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: This report from Ibn ‘Abbaas is related by ‘Abdullaah Ibn al-Imaam Ahmad (As-Sunnah: 586), Ibn Abee Shaybah (al-&#8216;Arsh: 61), Ibn Khuzaymah (At-Tawheed: 248), and by alHaakim (Al-Mustadrak: 2:282) who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of alBukhaari and Muslim. Imaam ath-Thahabi agreed to the authentication of al-Haakim. Ad-Daaraqutni reported it in his book As-Sifaat (36) as mawqoof from Ibn ‘Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani said: “Its <em>isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, and its narrators are all reliable.” (Mukhtasar Al-’Uluw: 45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Shaykeh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah (Al-Fataawaa, 6:584), and Shaykh al-Albaani (AsSilsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109), stated the weakness of this narration from Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (Al-&#8216;Arsh, 58), and by Al-Baihaqi (Al-Asmaa’ wasSifaat, 862) with both narrations being from the way of Abee Thar (radhi Allaahu anhu). Shaykh al-Albaani (As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109) stated that there is no single authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) regarding <em>al-kursi</em> except this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] Reported by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (Tafseer at-Tabari, 30:115-116) on the authority of ‘Ali Ibn al-Hussain. The transmission, however, is mursal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A hadeeth is categorized as <em>mursal</em> when the link between the <em>taabi’ee</em> (successor of the <em>sahaabah</em>) and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is missing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[67] The infinitive noun is <em>takweer</em>, which means to round a thing in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] This has been reported in Sunan Abee Daawood (English Translation), no. 4708 and in the Sunnah by Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, no. 575, and by others. There is disagreement regarding the authenticity of its isnaad. Imaam ath-Thahabai and other scholars of hadeeth including al-Albaani graded its isnaad as weak. Imaam Ibn al-Aye supported its authenticity. The text describing al-&#8216;Arsh as a dome over the heavens is supported by the context of an authentic narration reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (Arabic/English), vol. 9, no. 519 and in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There are one-hundred degrees in al-Jannah which Allaah has prepared for those who carry on jihaad in His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and the earth, so if you ask Allaah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaws for it is the middle and highest part of al-Jannah and at its top is al-&#8216;Arsh of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah), and from it gush forth the rivers of al-Jannah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Arsh being the roof of the Firdaws, which is the middle and highest part of alJannah, indicates that it has a dome-shape because a thing cannot be at the middle and at its highest point (peak) unless it is round. [See Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-Fataawaa</em>, vol. 5, pp. 150-155, and the book of <em>Al-&#8216;Arsh</em> by Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthmaan Ibn Abee Shaybah (Riyadh, KSA: Maktabat ar-Rushd (checked by Dr. Muhammad Ibn Khaleefah at-Tameemi), 1418/1998), p. 333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] This is based upon additional explanation of the translated text which the author, Shaykh Ibn ’Uthaymeen, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, directly related to me on Wednesday the 16th of Safar 1419Hj, corresponding to the 10th of June 1998. He stated that this explanation fits with that of the hadeeth on the Firdaws as mentioned above. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 89</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High, showed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388430280&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-revealed-to-his-prophet-what-will-occur-to-his-ummah-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> does not know the <em>ghayb</em> (hidden and unseen) and no-one from the created beings knows the hidden and unseen (<em>ghayb)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, no-one in the heavens or on the earth knows the hidden and unseen except Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naml (27), <em>aayah</em> 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-ghayb</em> (hidden and the unseen) is that which is hidden from us, whether it be in the past or in the future, we do not know it. However, the Prophets <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>, Allaah shows them something from the hidden and the unseen for the benefit of the <em>da`wah</em> (call to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High). And from them was our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for Allaah showed him some of the matters of the unseen and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of them for the benefit of the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Knower of the unseen so He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Except to a messenger He is pleased with; </strong>meaning that Allaah shows to him whatever He, the Perfect and Most High, wishes. For e.g. the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was walking along with his companions and they passed by two graves so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“These two are certainly being punished.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions were not aware that the two inhabitants of the graves were being punished. Allaah revealed it to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the punishment of the two deceased. So he said: <span style="color:#808000;"> “These two are certainly being punished.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was something which Allaah made him aware of and this was from the <em>kha<u>s</u>aa·i<u>s</u></em>, from the matters specific to the Messengers <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>. And Allaah made him aware of events that were going to occur in the future and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us about <em>Ashraa<u>t</u>is-Saa’ah</em> (The Signs of the Last Hour). He informed us about the <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations) in order that we should beware and have fear lest these matters come upon us so that we could be upon clear insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informed us for our benefit from the angle of warning so that we could safeguard ourselves. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was news for him (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that splitting would occur in the nation and it occurred just as he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) informed so that we should remain firm upon the truth and not go off along with those who contradict the truth.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: <em>Allaah Bi Annallaaha Ta`ala </em>and in some of the versions it has <em>Bi Annallaaha Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em> (Allaah, the Exalted and Most High). Just a slight one addition word; <em>Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (218) and Muslim (292) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: In the footnote it mentions checking of this has preceded and it will follow in the next point inshaaAllaah also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, with regard to the main point that Allaah, the Most High, shows His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what will occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection and the reference for this as some of the verifiers mention is a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6604) and reported by Muslim (2891) as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Hu<u>th</u>ayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet gave us an address; khutbah, he did not leave anything out of it that will happen until the establishment of the Hour except that he mentioned it. Whoever knew of it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it was ignorant of it and I used to see things happening, which I had forgotten so then I would recognise them just as a man recognises when something has been absent from him then when he sees it again, he recognises it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made an important point also with regard to this point that &#8220;<em>Allaah, the Most High made His Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam aware. He showed him things that would happen in his nation until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;</em>. Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, this saying contains some degree of generality. So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High did not show His Prophet everything that was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection because this is from <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (the knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is specific to the Lord of Might and Majesty. However, He showed him some events and some matters that were going to occur. And therefore, there occurs in the two sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>s from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came to the graveyard and gave the greeting, “<em>May Allaah grant you security O believing people and we will if Allaah wills be joining you</em>.” Then he said, “I would have loved that I would have seen my brothers.” So they (the companions) said, “Are we not your brothers Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “You are my companions and my brothers are those who have not yet come.” So they said, “How will you recognise those who have not yet come from your nation O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, do you see if a man had some horses with white marks upon their heads and their arms and they were amongst some dark horses, would he not recognise his own horses?” So they said, “Yes indeed O Messenger of Allaah”. He said, “Then they will come with white marks on account of the wudu and I will precede you to the <em><u>h</u>aw<u>d</u> </em>(the great reservoir). Indeed some men will be repelled away from my reservoir just as a stray camel is repelled away. I will call to them, Come. So it will be said, they changed after you. So then I will say, <em>suhqan</em>, <em>suhqan</em>, be away, be far away.”</strong><strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So this is a proof that he was not informed of everything that would occur in his nation but rather, he was informed of some things that were going to have a serious effect. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of some of that just as is written in the books of the Sunnah and that does not mean that he became aware of everything that was going to occur in his nation and everything that would occur amongst them and to them as is believed by some people and I have researched this matter of my refutation of Ibn ul Haaj in the book <em>Awza hul al ishaarah fir raddi ala man ajaza mamnu minal ziyaara</em>, the clear indication in refutation of those who make permissible the forbidden type of visitation of graves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So refer to that treatise because it is beneficial in its topic and that is from the bounty and beneficence of Allaah and His grant of success. And beware O student of knowledge of being slow or being too lazy to digest this matter because it is something that has great importance and by researching it and understanding it, you can become free from the beliefs of <em>shirk</em> and you can come to know the position of the <em>Salaf</em> well in this matter and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then finally on this point, <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> summarised this point by saying the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen) is of two categories. He mentioned:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Firstly, <strong><em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em></strong>: That which is totally hidden and unseen and that is known only to Allaah, nobody else knows it, and,</li>
<li><strong><em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee</em></strong>: That which is partially hidden and unseen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is partially hidden and unseen refers to that which Allaah has made His Prophets aware of just as, He, the Most High said, the <em>aayah</em> that came at the beginning:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah, the Most High, is the Knower of the hidden and unseen so He does not reveal that which He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em>; that which is unrestrictedly hidden and unseen is something specific to Allaah and the <em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee;</em> that which is partially hidden and unseen is that which He made His Prophets aware of.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[FOURTH]: In the fourth statement, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ<br />
Who is it that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word { ْ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن</strong></span> } &#8220;Who” is an interrogative noun [46] and the intended use of the interrogation in the sentence is to assert the <strong>negation</strong> [that there is none who can intercede] as evident in the <strong>affirmation</strong> phrase which followed it: { ِ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> إإِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong> </span> } “<strong>Except with His Permission</strong>.” Whenever a negation takes the form of an interrogative construct, then the statement is infused with the meaning of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Intercession (<em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em>):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَشْفَعُ </strong> </span>}<br />
“<strong>Intercedes</strong>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">know that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . Linguistically, the term “<em>shafaa’ah</em>” means to make an odd number an even one.[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 . Traditionally, it refers to the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off harm. Thus the <em>shafaa’ah</em> of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em> [48] after the worry and distress which befalls them and which they are unable to bear is an intercession to ward off a harm. On the other hand, the Prophet’s <em>shafaa’ah</em> for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> [49] to enter <em>al-Jannah</em> is aimed at procuring a benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. None can intercede except by Allaah’s Permission: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span> } His Leave is <em>kawni</em>. [50] Even Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has the greatest rank with Allaah cannot intercede except with the prior leave from Allaah. He will be granted this permission after he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prostrates before Allaah and praises Him with the great praises and glorifications which Allaah guides him to it on that day. Then it will be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;ارفع رأسك وقل يُسمَع واشفَعْ تُشَف َّع.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Raise your head and speak; you will be listened to, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”</strong> </span>[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is known] that no one have a rank with Allaah greater than that of the Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم], nevertheless, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) cannot intercede except with the prior leave of Allaah. It is so because of Allaah, Most Majestic and Most High’s, perfection of Authority and <em>hayybah</em>.[52] The more a king’s authority becomes fully established, the more reverent and respected he becomes. People would not even speak in his court unless he speaks. Consider the Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) relation with his companions and which Quraysh’s [53] emissary [‘Urwah bin Mas’oud] described [after finalizing the treaty of AlHudaybiyah]: &#8220;<em>And when they spoke to him they would lower their voices</em>.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is out of respect. You find that if a king is revered by his flock, then no one can speak in his court and in his presence because of the might of his authority. [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[The Conditions of Confirmed Intercession]:</strong></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, (تعالى ), has made it clear that He does not permit intercession except for the one whom He approves of and whose word is acceptable to Him, and for the one He is pleased with and on whose behalf intercession shall be made. It is inevitable that Allaah is pleased with <em>ash-shaafi</em>’, the intercessor, and al-<em>mashfoo’i lahu</em>, the one on whose behalf intercession is sought.[57] Consequently, the idols of the polytheists could not intercede on their behalf with Allaah because Allaah does not approve of them. The Prophets and the righteous do not intercede on behalf of the polytheists because the latter are not approved with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the conditions for the confirmed <em>shafaa’ah</em> are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah’s permission of it.<br />
2. Allaah being pleased with the <em>shaafi</em>’.<br />
3. His approval of the one on whose behalf intercession is sought (<em>al-mashfoo’i lahu</em>).[58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] In the grammatical sense, the noun { ْ<strong>مَن</strong> ] is the subject, and the term { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ذَا</strong> </span>] is omitted for being redundant. The term { <strong>الَّذِي</strong> } &#8220;<em>he that</em>&#8221; is a relative pronoun standing as the predicate of the subject {مَن } &#8220;<em>Who</em>.” [Author’s note].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Allaah (تعالى) said: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </strong></span> }, [which means], <strong>And by the <em>shaf’a</em></strong> (even) <strong>and the <em>witr</em> </strong>(odd) [of all the creations of Allaah]. [Qur’aan <em>Soorat Al-Fajr</em> (89:3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Ahlul-Mawqif:</strong> All human beings gathered on one plane on the Day of Resurrection awaiting their accounts to be taken by Allaah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate it or to bear it</strong></span>.” The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercedes with Allaah to pronounce His Judgment among the people of <em>al-Mawqif</em>. They will be relieved from their long standing by virtue of his interceding with Allaah on their behalf. [See <em>Saheeh alBukhaari</em> (Arabic/English)], vol. 6, no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Jannah:</em> The believers who will be admitted to reside forever in <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em><strong>Kawni</strong></em>: Pertaining to the Universal Will of Allaah, the Most Majestic and Most Magnificent, and which is in accordance with His Foreknowledge and Wisdom. Creation, provisions, life, death, permission to intercede, and so forth exists by the Will of Allaah. Everything that Allaah Wills is certain to occur. He Willed that <em>eemaan</em> (belief in Allaah) and <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) occur, although He Loves <em>eemaan</em> and Hates <em>kufr</em>. On the other hand, the Legislative Decree (<em>al-hukm ash-shar’i</em>) comprises the Revealed Laws (<em>sharee’ah</em>) which the Messengers came with and what is stated in the Revealed Scriptures. Under this Decree, Allaah Loves that mankind believe in Him (<em>eemaan</em>) and does not Love for them to commit <em>kufr</em>. Mankind, however, may or may not believe in Allaah. In short, under His Universal Will, everything Allaah Wills is certain to pass while under the Legislative Will, what is beloved to Allaah may or may not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51] Part of a long and agreed upon <em>hadeeth</em>. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em> (Arabic/ English)], vol. 6, no. 3 and no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] <em>Hayybah</em>: An attribute inspiring reverence, or veneration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54]This is part of a long hadeeth detailing the story of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 3, hadeeth 891 (English/Arabic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] Kings are in need of intercessors because of the imperfection of their knowledge, might and authority. Allaah, Most Perfect in His Might, Knowledge, and Authority, is in no need for intercessors. That is why intercession with Allaah takes place only if He permits it. With kings, however, intercession is permitted with or without a king’s permission. Those close to the king, for example, may intercede without permission. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s<em> Al-Qawlul Mufeed ‘Alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed</em> (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1st ed. 1415/1994)], vol. 1, p. 330, 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56]The intercessions permitted by Allaah تعالى are six. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) will have the privilege of making three of these intercessions. They are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em>. This is known as the Prophet’s greatest <em>shafaa’ah</em> and it is part of the highest station of praise and honour (<em>almaqaam al-mahmood</em>) with which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is distinguished, and for which he will be praised by all creatures. It is mentioned in the Qur’aan [17:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> to enter <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercession with Allaah تعالى to reduce the punishment of his uncle, Abu Taalib because of his protection and support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He will be placed in a shallow part of Hell-Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other intercessions are not restricted to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Prophet’s intercession with Allaah تعالى that He does not cast into Hell the one who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. His intercession of taking out from Hell those admitted to it because of their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The intercession to raise the ranks of the believers. This is the du’aa of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to believers and by the believers for each other.</p>
<p>[See (1) Shaykh bin Baaz’s commentary on Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-’Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> which Shaykh ‘Ali Hasan ‘Abdul Hameed compiled in his verification of Shaykh ‘AbdurRahmaan As-Sa’di’s book <em>At-Tanbeehaat Al-lateefah ‘Ala Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar Ibnul Qayyim, 1409/1989), p. 73, and (2) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul-Mufeed</em>, pp. 332-335].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercessions mentioned above are the ones approved by Allaah (تعالى). The annulled intercession is any intercession not approved by Allaah(تعالى ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The conditions are stated in the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission.</strong> </span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Baqarah</em> (2:255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَاعَةُ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلًا</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On that day, no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Taha</em> (20:109)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan,<em>Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’</em> (21:28)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] The case of intercession on behalf of the Prophet’s uncle, Abu Taalib, is excluded and in a very limited sense from the ruling stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَاعَةُ الشَّافِعِينَ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">No intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [unbelievers, polytheists]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Muddathir</em> (74:48)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taalib stood in support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and protected him from his enemies of Quraysh. The intercession on behalf of Abu Taalib is special for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Other than this special intercession, none is allowed to intercede for a kaafir. Even Abu Taalib is not saved from the Fire of Hell. Had it not been for the intercession of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Abu Taalib “<strong>would have been in the bottom of the (Hell) Fire</strong>,” as the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said. “<strong>Perhaps my intercession will be helpful to him on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be put in a shallow fire reaching only up to his ankles with which his brain will boil</strong>,” he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 5, no. 222 and no. 224, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul Mufeed</em>, vol. 1, p. 334].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[THIRD]: In the Third statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The name {<strong>ما</strong>} &#8220;maa&#8221; here is a conjunctive noun (gram. <em>ism mawsool</em>) taking a form of generalization.

The meaning, therefore, is that Allaah is the One Who masters the affairs of everything in existence in the heavens and the earth: <strong>creating</strong>, <strong>sovereignty-kingship,</strong> and <strong>management</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sentence <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong> &#8221; <strong>&#8220;To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span> is a declarative clause in which the predicate (gram. khabar) { <strong>له</strong> } “To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <em>mubtada</em>’) which is the conjunctive noun {ما} &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <em>hasr</em> (exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that to Him (Allaah) alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Accordingly, since creating, sovereignty-kingship, and management of affairs belong to Allaah alone, it is incumbent that we should surrender to Him alone because we are His slaves, and a slave must surrender to the One Who Owns and Masters him, Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, we must stand to <strong>persevere Allaah’s pre-decree</strong> because we are His possession and anything that is owned by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then it follows that is His right to administer its affairs as He Wills. This right is the same whether His pre-decree applies to the person himself, his family, wealth, friends, country, or the rest of mankind. The important thing is that since the dominion belongs to Allaah, then it is His exclusive right to do whatever He Wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the saying of Allaah (which means),<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,”</strong> </span>the term “heavens” came in the <strong>plural form</strong> [45] while the word “earth” was stated in the <strong>singular</strong> though what is meant is the plural. In this regard, the intended usage of the term “earth” refers to the <em>jins</em> (kind).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] From the angels, jinn, and all that which exists, including which we have no knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] The Qur’aan has stated that there are seven heavens:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Who is the Rabb of the seven heavens and the Rabb of the great &#8216;Arsh?</strong></span><br />

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ </strong>]<strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah did not say (what means): “<strong>He does not sleep</strong>,” instead He said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/asma-wa-sifaat-com/">:</a><span style="color:#008000;">{<strong> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ</strong> }</span> (which means) “<strong>does not overtake Him</strong>” in order to comprise the sleep that overcomes and that arising by choice. If you say, “Does not sleep,” it would imply that He does not sleep by choice. However, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not sleep neither by <em>ghalabah</em> (overcoming) nor by choice, because sleep is an imperfect attribute which contradicts both the perfection of the Self and the perfection in relation to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is given to sleep misses a lot of his work because of His sleeping. Consider, for example, the case of a person who has many people working for him and he sleeps a lot. He is unable to neither reckon with nor manage the business or other related matters. This is an imperfection with respect to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard to self-perfection, sleep is a deficiency because it indicates that the person’s body got tired and thus he needed the sleep as a rest from what has passed, as well as a means to renew his activity to engage in what will come ahead. That is the why <strong>the people of <em>al-Jannah</em> do not sleep</strong>—because of the perfection of their lives and bodies. No illness or the like touches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone says, <span style="color:#993300;">“We know that the person who does not sleep is unable to do so because of some kind of sickness or a defect, while you say that the lack of sleep is perfection. Explain.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say, “This applies to the creature, and in this case perfection is a relative matter [with respect to Allaah it is perfection]. There is no doubt that the person who does not sleep because of an illness has a defect, and that is why he stays always in a state of languor and exhaustion. Thus, his welfare will not be established. This is evident from the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا </strong>]<br />
<strong style="color:#008000;font-size:1rem;">And have made your sleep as a thing for rest<br />
</strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Naba’ (78:9)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that sleep is something that will discontinue the hardship and tiredness. If Allaah would sleep, and far is He above such imperfection, then this would necessitate that He needs to rest. In addition, the creation will be ruined because they are in need of Him; even the sleeping person is in need of Allaah. In fact, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to invoke Allaah at night when he was about to sleep:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِنْ أَمْسَكْتَ نَفْسِي فَارْحَمْهَا، وَإِنْ أَرْسَلْتَهَا فَاحْفَظْهَا، بِمَا تَحْفَظُ بِهِ عِبَادَكَ الصَّالِحِين</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If You take my soul, bestow mercy on it [and forgive it, as in another narration], and if You release it then protect it as You protect your righteous slaves.”</strong></span> [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, it is impossible that Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, sleeps. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَنَامُ وَلاَ يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep.&#8221;</strong></span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word [ ”<strong>لا يَنبَغِي</strong> &#8220;] does not befit] when used in the Qur’aan and sunnah means “the thing which is absolutely impossible to be,” as Allaah (تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا </strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But it is not befitting for </strong>(the Majesty of) <strong>ar-Rahmaan </strong>(Allaah)<strong> that He should beget a son </strong>(or offspring or children)<strong>.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam (19:92)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It should be noted] that Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</strong> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">signifies <em><strong>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</strong></em> (attributes of negation: negating any imperfection and implying perfection). The rule with respect to the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the Most High, is that there is no such thing as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pure</span> attribute of negation.[40] Indeed, when <em>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</em> are mentioned, it is because they imply the perfection of the attributes that are in contradiction to those of negation.[41] So, because of the Perfection of Allaah’s Life and <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>,[42] then neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 8, no. 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 343.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] This is because mere negation does not denote any attribute, and therefore it is not considered praise. In addition, the attributes of negation are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. General, and<br />
2. Specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of generality in negation is that Allaah, Most High, negates all imperfections implicitly denoting that all Perfection is His. For example: Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ <strong>لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</strong> ], [which means], “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong></span>.” So, there is nothing unto Him in His Knowledge, Ability, Hearing, Seeing, Might, Wisdom, Mercy, and so forth. In this general negation, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not specify the negation. Accordingly, all imperfections are denied and all perfections are denoted, and it is stated that there is <strong>nothing like unto Him</strong> in all of His Perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the specificity in negation is to negate specific allegations of imperfection. For example to deny that defects and drawbacks like forgetfulness, sleep, ignorance, having son or partner, etc. are associated with Allaah, the Exalted. Again, the Perfection is implied as against the negation. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul Waasitiyyah</em>], vol. 1, pp. 145-146.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] For example, the negation of ignorance stands for the affirmation of Allaah’s unlimited knowledge. The negation of death, which is in contradiction of life, implies the perfection of Allaah’s attribute of Life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[42] <em>Qayyoumiyyah</em>: The Attribute denoted by Allaah’s Name <em>al-Qayyoum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] The Perfection of His Life negates that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) needs to sleep and the same is due to the Perfection of His <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>, as the created living creatures due to their imperfection need sleep. Although sleeping and eating may be considered as attributes of perfection with respect to man, as a person who does not sleep or eat is considered ill, they are perfection from one angle and defects from another. They are perfection in the sense that they indicate that the body is sound and healthy, and are defects because the body needs them to function. In reality, therefore, they are defects. Accordingly, the &#8220;perfection&#8221; in the created is only relevant, i.e. particular to the created, not shared by the Most Perfect, i.e. Allaah. Eating, drinking and sleeping are relative “perfections” with respect to the created and negated defects with respect to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah, the Most High, said about Himself:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ </strong>]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And it is He </strong>(Allaah) <strong>Who feeds and is not fed.</strong></span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 46: Points 75</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And you should know that Allaah has favoured some of the servants over others in this world and in the Hereafter, He has done so justly. It cannot be said that He acted unjustly or has shown undue favour. Whoever says that Allaah has favoured the true believer and the disbeliever equally then he is a person upon innovation. Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever, the obedient one over the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the one who is humiliated; doing so justly. It is His favour, which He bestows upon whomever He wishes and withholds from whomever He wishes.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-has-favoured-some-of-the-servants-over-others-he-has-done-so-justly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah has favoured the servants; some of them over others in this world and in the Hereafter,”</strong></span> Allaah has favoured some of the people over others. He has bestowed favour upon the believer over the disbeliever with that which Allaah has given him from <em>eemaan</em> on account of his having <em>eemaan</em> and He withheld from the disbeliever on account of his disbelief. And Allaah favoured the believers, some over others and the Messengers (the <em>Rusul); </em>Allaah favoured some of them over others.</p>
<p><strong>تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those Messengers, We favoured some of them over others.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favor/bounty) of Allaah, which He gives to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High and no-one may raise any objection to Allaah because this is His <em>mulk</em> (kingdom), that which belongs to Him, He, the Perfect, He can give it to whomever He wishes. So, the kingdom belongs to Him, He can give it to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect. And the favour that is bestowed is His favour, He may give it to whomever He wishes. So, there could be no objection raised against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>; this deviant sect, they say, “<em>It is obligatory that Allaah treats the people equally and gives them all the same</em>.” This is to show evil manners towards Allaah and is to raise objections against Him, High and Tremendously Exalted is Allaah above that which they say. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, bestows favour on some of His creation over and above others and this is His kingdom, it belongs to Him so there can be no objection to Him. He does not punish anyone except for a crime that He has actually committed since to do so would contradict justice and Allaah does not oppress. So, He does not punish anyone without his having committed a crime or punish anyone for somebody else’s crime.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَىٰ حِمْلِهَا لَا يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of sin will bear the sins of another and if someone weighed down with sins were to call someone else to bear his sins for him then he will not be able to find anyone to bear any of them for him even if it be a close relative.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with regard to the aspect of <em>al-jazaa</em>· (recompense) that He gives then His recompense is <em>adl</em> (just) and as for the aspect of <em>al-a<u>t</u>aa·</em> (what He gives freely) then this is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) from him, He, the Perfect and Most High and it is not for anyone to raise any objection to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says that the favour of Allaah upon the believer and the disbeliever is just the same then he is a person of innovation.” </strong></span>This is the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say that &#8211; <em>&#8220;It is obligatory upon Allaah to make all of the people believers and that He should not make just some of them disbelievers and some of them believers. He should make all of them rich, He should make all of them scholars.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to raise an objection against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High because Allaah is <em>Hakeem</em> (All-Wise). And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of the people the same in knowledge or in riches or in reward and punishment. And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of mankind wealthy. If all of them were wealthy people then the creation would be ruined because they would not find anyone who would carry out any work and production would cease. And therefore, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has favoured some of the people over others with regard to provision. He has made this one rich and this one poor so that the creation can thrive. If they were all rich then they would not produce anything. And if they were all poor then they would not be able to work and produce. So, Allaah has caused them to vary so that the creation should operate and thrive.</p>
<p><strong>وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضًا سُخْرِيًّا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We raised some of them over others in levels so that some of them should employ others to work.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, some of them employ others to work for wages. So, when that happens then the creation can grow and prosper and benefits are attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever and the obedient one over the disobedient one of the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the despicable one,” </strong></span>Allaah favoured the believer over the disbeliever and He gave favour to the obedient one over the sinner; this is His justice (<em>adl</em>), He, the Perfect and His <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) so no-one may raise any objection to Him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point:  Briefly with regard to the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after some speech, he said at the end,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore this section, this part here necessitates from us that we have the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, caused His servants to be of different levels as <strong>a favour from Him and as justice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is not to be questioned about that which He does. Rather, they are to be questioned. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it cannot be said, “<em>Why did He make that one a Messenger and make that one a person who is humiliated and why did He make that one a believer who is granted success of correctness whereas He made that one a rejected one and humiliated?</em>” That should not be said. Rather, it is obligatory that we believe that Allaah is free of committing oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> and that He does whatever He wishes and He decrees whatever He wills. However, all His actions are based upon <em>hikmah</em> (wisdom) and <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) and <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and <em>adl</em> (justice). That is what is obligatory upon us to believe with regard to our Lord, the Majestic and Most High. This is the creed that is supported by the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Prophetic texts and it is that which the scholars of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> are agreed in consensus upon and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 41 : Point 65</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah. And that Allaah will not punish anyone except according to the degree of his sins. And if He were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth; the righteous and the wicked amongst them, then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them. And it is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust since the unjust is the one who takes something that is not his to take, whereas creation and decree is for Allaah. The creation is His creation and the world is His world. He is not to be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned. And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-no-one-will-enter-paradise-except-by-the-mercy-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah,” </strong><em>Al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) is expensive and exalted and it cannot be reached through deeds, no matter how much a person works and even if he does all the acts of obedience then his deeds will not meet up to the favours that have been bestowed upon him. So, if he were to be brought to account for those favours then no deed would remain for him. This is from one aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second aspect</strong> is that Paradise is expensive and it does not have a price that can be assessed in terms of deeds or wealth or other than that, no-one knows how tremendous it is except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, Allaah enters the believers into Paradise by His <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) by means of their deeds. So, deeds are just a <em>sabab</em> (means) towards entry into Paradise but they do not necessitate entry into Paradise nor are they the price for Paradise. And therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one from amongst you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in order that a person should not become amazed and complacent at his own deeds. It is not stated so that he should abandon performing deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong> ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Enter into Paradise on account of that which you used to do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah</em> 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Baa here does not show compensation or the price. Rather, the Baa here, <strong>“Bimaa Kuntum Ta’maloon”</strong> is to show a cause or a means, meaning by means of that which he used to do as is shown by the <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“None of you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.” So, they said, “Not even you Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So, he said, “Nor even me unless Allaah covers me with His mercy.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a person should not become amazed at his own deeds. However, a person will not enter into Paradise except by means of deeds. So, if a person did not perform any deeds, he will not enter Paradise because he has not carried out the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah does not punish anyone except in accordance with the degree of his sins,” </strong>Paradise is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (a favour) from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and is through the mercy of Allaah and deeds are a means for entry into it and the People of the Fire will not be punished except in accordance with their sins. They will not be punished because of the sins of other people and they will not be punished whilst not having any sins. So, this is from `<em>adl</em> (justice). So, Paradise is from <em>al-fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and the Fire is from <em>al-`adl</em> (justice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if He were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, the righteous ones of them and the wicked ones of them then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them.” </strong>This is just as has preceded that a person no matter how many deeds he performs then his deeds will not match up to even a part of the favours of Allaah upon him. If Allaah were to punish him that would be justice because of his falling short in giving thanks for the favours of Allaah upon him. And this speech which he mentioned is the text of a <u>h</u>adeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the people of His earth then He would punish them and He would not be unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better than their deeds deserved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because He would punish the evildoer on account of his evil acts and He would be punishing the righteous person because of the fact that his deeds did not qualify him for entry into Paradise because he did not match the favours of Allaah upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust,” </strong>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has declared Himself free of <em><u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression, injustice).</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Fu<u>ss</u>illat (41), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p><strong>لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There will be no injustice on this day. Allaah is quick in reckoning.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah</em> 17)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not wrong anyone.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We did not oppress them. However, they were the wrongdoers.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not oppress them but rather they oppressed their own souls.</span> </strong>(Soorah Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>118)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> reported the words of his Lord, He the Most High that He said: (Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O My servants I have made oppression forbidden for Myself and I have made it forbidden for you to oppress one another so do not commit oppression.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is a just judge and oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm</em>) does not befit Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And oppression is only one taking that which is not His to take whereas creation and decree is for Allaah.” </strong><em>A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression) is to wrongfully take the right of the people. And do the people have any right over Allaah? They have no right upon Allaah and no-one can make anything binding upon Allaah. Rather, the right of the servants with Allaah is that He should not punish one who does not associate anything with Him. <span style="color:#800080;">This is a right which He, the Perfect, has given as a favour</span>. And oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> is to put something in other than its due place. So, Allaah does not put punishment upon those who deserve bliss and He does not give bliss to those who deserve punishment. Rather, He gives bliss to those who deserve it and He gives punishment to those who deserve it and this is <em>al-`adl</em> (justice) but as for the opposite then that would be oppression. If He were to punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour to the people of disbelief, this would be oppression and Allaah is free of that. It is not possible that He will punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour upon the people of disbelief and that He will enter the disbelievers into Paradise and enter the believers into the Fire. This does not befit Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah; creation and decree are for Him and the creation is His creation and the world is His world.” </strong>Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not creating and commanding His? Exalted is Allaah, the Lord and nurturer of the whole of creation.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Alaa lahul- khalq,” </strong>Is creating not His?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is to bring things into existence from non-existence. So, all the created being were created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one can create along with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who they claim create with the like of His creation such that the creation is confused for them? Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer. </span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation such that the creation would be confused for them?”</strong> Such that that created by the servant resembles that created by Allaah, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, “Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer.”’</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see that which you call upon besides Allaah? Show me what they have created upon the earth.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<em>al-khalq</em>,” creating is for Allaah alone, <em>w`al-amar,</em>” and the decree and the command is for Him,” </strong><em>al-amar</em> (command/decree) is legislating and sending down legislation. So, the Creator, He is the one who commands and forbids and legislates for His servants whatever is beneficial for them and He it is Who forbids whatever is harmful for them and it is not for anyone to command or forbid or to obligate an act of worship or to prohibit anything without a proof.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they have partners who legislate things from the religion for them that Allaah has not given permission for.</span> </strong>(Soorah ash-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>amar</em> (decree/command) is for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, the command relating to what occurs in creation and relating to what is pre-decreed, <em>w’al amrush-shar`ee</em> (and the command relating to what is legislated), He commands and He prohibits, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not the creating and the command for Him?</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made a distinction between <em>khalq</em> (creating) and <em>al-amar</em> (commanding). So, this shows the command is not something created and this contains a refutation of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who said that the Qur·aan is created and that the speech of Allaah is created. So, Allaah had made a distinction between the creating and between the command. The command is from His speech and His legislation and Allaah has made a distinction between the creation and between the command. So, this proves that the speech of Allaah is not created.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the world is His world, He, the Majestic and Most High.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the abodes are three;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>daarud-duniya</em> (the abode of this world),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second,</strong> <em>wa daarul-barzakh</em> (intermediate period in the grave),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the third one,</strong> <em>wa daarul-qaraar wahiyaa al-aakhirah</em> (the abode of permanent residence and it is the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of them belong to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will not be asked about what He does but they will be asked,” </strong>He cannot be asked about what He does, He, the Perfect and Most High because His actions contain no deficiency and there is no shortcoming in them. So, they are perfect and precise and they never suffer from any deficiency or any shortcoming and questions are only to be asked about one who has deficiencies or shortcomings in his actions. So, Allaah cannot be asked about what He does because His actions are perfect and complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second reason;</strong> it is not just on account of His overpowering and His Lordship as is said by those who say it that He cannot be asked because of His tremendousness, He, the Perfect and Most High and because of His Majesty. However, it is not this alone, rather, He is not to be asked also because His actions are perfect and precise. They do not suffer from any deficiency at all or any flaws, contrary to the created being for he will be asked about his actions because he commits errors and his deeds are deficient and observations are to be made concerning him. So, he will be questioned because he is deficient from every aspect except for those who are rendered complete and aided and supported by Allaah. And therefore, he said, <strong>“But rather they will be questioned.”</strong> This is the difference between the Creator and the created being that Allah is not to be questioned whereas, the created being will be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“</strong><strong>And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation.</strong><strong>” </strong>No objection is to be raised about Allaah such that it is said, “Why did Allaah create such and such and How did Allaah create these things?” This is not permissible with respect to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Rather, it is upon us to submit and to comply and to believe that the actions of Allaah are perfect and complete and do not suffer any deficiency or shortcoming. So, even if some of the points of wisdom or the underlying reasons remain hidden to us then still we do not ask about them, rather, we submit. So, if we understand the wisdom and the underlying reason then this is fine but if we do not understand it then we submit and we do not raise objections to Allaah or withhold from action until we know the wisdom or the underlying reason.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward. </strong></span>(Surah An-Nisa , aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that He does not treat any of His servants with injustice on the Day of Resurrection, be it the weight of a mustard seed or a speck of dust. Rather, Allah shall reward them for this action and multiply it, if it were a good deed. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(And We shall set up balances of justice)</strong></span> Allah said that Luqman said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth)</span></strong>. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.)</span> </strong>The Two Sahihs recorded the long Hadith about the intercession that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated, and in which the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Allah then says, &#8220;Go back, and take out of the Fire everyone in whose heart you find the weight of a mustard seed of faith&#8221;)</span></strong> In another narration, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(&#8220;Whosoever had the least, least, least speck of faith, take him out of the Fire,&#8221; and they will take out many people.)</span></strong> Abu Sa`id then said, &#8220;Read, if you will,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust).&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 44</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And reflecting about Allaah is an innovation because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Reflect upon the creation and do not reflect upon Allaah because reflecting about the Lord casts doubt into the heart.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374566673&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-obligatory-to-avoid-reflecting-upon-the-self-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory upon the Muslim to avoid reflecting upon the Self of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and reflecting upon how (<em>kayfiyyah)</em>, how of His names and attributes and actions? Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He, Allaah knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge. </strong></span>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and to venerate the Lord, the Perfect and Most High without reflecting upon His Self and how His names and attributes are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Reflect upon the creation but do not reflect upon Allaah,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> reflect upon the things created by Allaah and upon the signs Allaah has put in the creation (<em>aayaat ul-kowniyyah)</em>.This will indicate to you the power of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions some lines of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>&#8220;So how can the One truly worshipped be disobeyed </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>or how can the denier deny Him when in everything </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>there is a sign for him proving that He is one.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you should reflect upon the signs within the creation, in the heavens and the earth and the mountains and the rocks and the trees and the oceans and the created beings to derive proof from them for the tremendousness of the Creator, the Perfect and Most High and reflect upon the <em>aayahs</em> of Allaah in the Qur&#8217;aan. But as for your reflecting upon Allaah’s Self and how His names and attributes are, then you will not be able to reach that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they do not encompass Him with knowledge.<br />
</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">H</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 110)</span><a style="font-size:1rem;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in his book <em>Al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> and also by al-Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool al-I’tiqaad</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar and the reality is some of the verifiers point out of those books that the chain of narration of that <u>h</u>adeeth is weak there and the <u>h</u>adeeth is also reported though by Aboo Shaykh in his book <em>Al-Adama</em> and by Abul Qaasim al-Asbahaaniyy in his book <em>At</em>&#8211;<em>Targheeb</em> as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and this <u>h</u>adeeth was declared to be <em>hasan</em> (good) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy due to its having a number of narrations of support also from  a narration of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and so on. At the end Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned the different narrations. In summary, he said in <em>As-Saheehah</em> no. 1,788, “The <u>h</u>adeeth when its chain of narrations gathered is <em>hasan</em> (good) in my view and Allaah knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said:  <em>“Reflect upon the creation but do not reflect upon Allaah,”</em> The verifier of the book mentioned that the <u>h</u>adeeth has some weakness in it and he mentioned that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates the <u>h</u>adeeth as being a <u>h</u>adeeth that is <em>hasan</em> (good) due to supports and he gave the reference for that. I (Shaykh Ahmad)  say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <u>h</u>adeeth, its authentication needs examination and it may be the case that it is the speech of some of the Salaf and I say that reflecting upon Allaah meaning with regard to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic’s Self, this is not befitting because a servant if he thinks, he reflects then he will only think and reflect based upon what his intellect pictures and based upon what crosses his mind with regard to things that he’s actually seen or heard or known whereas Allaah, the Perfect and Most High is above all of that. So, it is not befitting that anyone reflects upon His Self, He, the Most High because whenever a person imagines something then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will be contrary to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What will suffice us is to reflect upon Allaah’s creation and with regard to His tremendous and amazing ability and if a person were to reflect upon his own origin that will suffice him. So, let him reflect upon how Allaah caused that sperm drop to change, which He created him from into this tremendous being. How Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic changed that sperm drop from which He created an animal; one animal from another animal and how Allaah prepared everything from the created beings for that which He intended from it. So, Allaah prepared the cows for cultivation and He prepared the camels for carrying and so on and so forth as we can see and as we know. So, the One who is able to change that sperm drop into a person and a different one into an animal, is He not the Lord who has full ability over everything? Yes indeed and we bear witness over that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, what is important is that reflection should be upon the creation of Allaah not about His Self</strong> and let us read the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is obligatory upon us to submit to this <em>aayah</em> so that our minds do not stumble into things that are not befitting and if it is the case that Paradise contains things that no eye has ever seen and no ear has ever heard of nor have ever crossed the heart, never crossed the mind of any human and it is a created thing created by Allaah then how about the Self of Allaah? And success is granted by Allaah.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 43</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>ومن زعم أنه يرى ربه في دار الدنيا فهو كافر بالله عز وجل</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And whoever claims that he sees his Lord in this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374551685&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-he-saw-his-lord-in-this-world-then-he-is-a-disbeliever-in-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever claims that anyone can see Allaah in this world, seeing Him with their eyes not seeing Him in a dream then he is a disbeliever; <em>kaafir</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High cannot be seen in this world and therefore when <em>kaleemullaah</em>, the one to whom Allaah spoke, Moosa <em>alayhissalam</em>:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِي أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَٰكِنِ انظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي</p>
<p>لَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Moosaa (`<em>alayhissalaam</em>) said, “Oh my Lord, show Yourself to me so that I may look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me, however look at the mountain and if it remains settled at its place then you will see Me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one can see Allaah in this world (<em>dunya)</em>. This is a point of consensus (<em>ijmaa)</em> amongst the scholars. Rather, seeing Allaah will be in the Hereafter because the people in this world are weak, they are not able to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because of their weakness and therefore when Allaah manifested Himself to the mountain, it shattered and became dust. So, how about the son of Aadam who is made of flesh and blood?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for in the Hereafter, Allaah will give to the believers strength through which they will be able to see Allaah and they will delight in seeing Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, seeing Allaah in the Hereafter is established and is <em>mutawaatir</em> (quoted by a huge number of people at each level of transmission) is established for the believers. But as for in this world then no one will see Allaah with His eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disagree whether the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw Him on the night of the ascent through the Heavens or did not see Him. And what is correct or the great majority are upon is that the Messenger did not see Him with His eye but rather, he saw Him with his heart and with his insight because no one can see Allaah in this life, because Allah is greater than that anyone should see Him in this life and therefore when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Did you see your Lord on the night of the ascent (mi`raaj), ascent through the Heavens?” He said, “Noorun Anna Araahu.” (Light, how could I see Him?) ”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim <u>h</u>adeeth no. (178) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> that the Prophet responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Light, how could I see Him?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“His screen is light, if He were to uncover it then the shining light of His face would consume whatever his gaze came upon from His creation.</strong>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>H</u>adeeth also reported by Muslim (179) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author,  &#8216;<em>Whoever claims that he can see His Lord in the life of this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;</em>.  I say, this claim has been claimed by many of the <strong>heretic <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who say that they see their Lord and they see the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and take from him and take from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic directly and they believe that they are in a station higher than the station of Messengership and whoever claims this claim then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). There is no doubt about his disbelief and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> likewise mentions the same point that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the claim of the <strong>extreme <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who claim that they can take knowledge directly from Allaah, the Most High by way of Kashf and who claim that they can obtain knowledge of the hidden and unseen (<em>ghaib)</em> directly from Allaah, the Most High, this point refers to the like of them and that claim is disbelief.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 15 : Point 13</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, His Revelation and His Light. It is not created, because the Qur&#8217;aan is from Allaah and that which is from Allaah is not created. This is what was stated by Maalik ibn Anas and by Ahmad ibn Hanbal rahimahumAllaah and by the jurists who came before them and after them. And disputation concerning it is disbelief.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-quraan-is-the-speech-of-allaah-and-it-is-not-created" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, and His Revelation sent down and His Light. And it is not created”</strong>. From the creed and belief of AhlusSunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah is that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah. He spoke with it in reality and Jibreel heard it from Him and he descended with it to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. No one disagreed about this creed and belief, (no-one) from the people of knowledge who proceeded upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. The only ones who disagreed about it were the people of misguidance from the Jahmiyyah, the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, and the offspring of the Jahmiyyah who are the Mu`tazilah and the Zaydiyyah and the Shee`ah. All of those people took up this matter from the Jahmiyyah. And likewise the Ibaadiyyah; all of them proceeded upon the methodology which contradicts the methodology of the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah. And they held that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created because, in their view, Allaah is not to be described as speaking, just as He is not described with the Attribute of Hearing or Seeing or Knowing or Willing and other than that, in their view. Nor is he described as having a Face or having two Hands to other than that. And their intent in this is to corrupt the `aqeedah (creed and belief). Even if they try to make it seem that their intent is actually to declare Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, free from any resemblance to the created beings. And this is a false claim, because the Attributes of the Lord, the Perfect, do not resemble the attributes of the created beings. So the Lord, the Majestic and Most High, has Names (asmaa·) and Attributes (sifaat) which befit Him and His Greatness. And the created beings have names and attributes/characteristics which are appropriate for them and for their human nature. So there is no resemblance between the two types from the aspect of true reality, haqeeqah and of the ‘how’, kayfiyyah, even though they share in the meaning and the wording. And this is called al-mutawaati·, different things which are covered by a common word. However, they do not share in the reality and in how they are (kayfiyyah). This is the position of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and their proof for this is from the Book of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if anyone from the people of shirk seeks that you grant him protection then grant him protection so that he can hear the Speech of Allaah</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He ascribed Speech to Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and said with regard to the hypocrites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to alter the Speech of Allaah</strong></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He ascribed it to Himself. And the proofs from the Sunnah and the <em>ijmaa</em>` (consensus of this nation) are many for this matter. So it is a matter of certainty without there being any doubt. And the disagreement of the people of misguidance does not affect the fact that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah. And it is one instance of His Speech, He the Perfect. So Allaah speaks and He continues to speak whenever He wishes, if He wishes, with whatever He wishes. He has the Attribute of <em>Kalaam</em> (Speech) and this Qur&#8217;aan is one of the instances of the Speech of Allaah. So He spoke with the Tawraah and (He spoke) with the Injeel and with the Zaboor. He speaks with commands and with prohibitions. He says to something <em>kun</em>, be, and it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah&#8217;s)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> command, when He wills something, is just that He says to it be, and it is.</span></strong> (Soorah Yaaseen (36), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He affirmed for Himself qawl (Saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When Allaah said O `Eesaa</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He spoke to Moosaa, with Speech which Moosaa heard when He sent him to Fir&#8217;awn (the Pharaoh). So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has the Attribute of Speech and from His Speech is the honourable Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the people of misguidance, that its being ascribed to Allaah is ascribing a created thing to its Creator, like the she-camel of Allaah or the House of Allaah; so we say this is a lie, and it is a deception. That which is ascribed to Allaah is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category</strong> is ascription of abstract things or Attributes (ma`aanin) &#8211;  i.e non-material objects</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category</strong> is ascribing material objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abstract things or Attributes which are ascribed to Allaah: then this is to ascribe an Attribute to the One who has the Attribute. And it is a <strong>true and real ascription</strong>. So this will be from His Attributes, such as Speech and Hearing and Seeing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ascribing objects, such as the she-camel and the House of Allaah (the Ka`bah) this is ascription of a created thing to the One who created it. And it is an <strong>ascription to show honour</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But those people (those who say the Speech of Allaah means the speech created by Allaah) they have mixed up these two matters and they do not make a distinction between this and this. And therefore the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah state this matter in the Books of creed and beliefs to refute the people of misguidance. And if Allaah did not have Speech, as those people claim, then how does He command and prohibit? And the meaning of this would be that the Islamic rulings are nullified. And it undermines the main foundation and it is the Qur&#8217;aan. So if this fundamental is undermined, then Islaam would collapse. However they take cover under the claim of <strong><em>tanzeeh</em> </strong>(declaring Allaah free from resemblance to the creation). But this is not <em>tanzeeh</em>, rather it is <strong><em>ta`teel</em> </strong>(purely striping Him of Attributes). And there is a difference between <em>ta`teel</em> denying Attributes and between <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Him free from resemblance). <em>At-tanzeeh</em> is that which Allaah mentioned in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of anyone similar to Him?</span></strong> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance to the creation, which is mentioned by Allaah. And it is to deny any resemblance between the creation and the Creator or that the creation is equal to the Creator. That is what Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is declared free of. But as for denying the Attributes, then that is just ta`teel, pure denial and negation, which comes about as a result of <strong><em>tashbeeh</em> </strong>[01] . So they imagine resemblance initially and then they deny the Attributes secondly. And this is not tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance. So there is a difference between tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance and between ta`teel, denying the Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ash`arees came with something astonishing</strong>, even more astonishing than the saying of the Jahmiyyah. So they said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“The Speech of Allaah is divided into two categories: the meanings and the words. The meanings, this is the Speech of Allaah. And Allaah has the Attribute that He has Speech, and it is the meaning which has existed eternally in Himself. But as for Allaah speaking with letters and with a voice, then this is to be denied for Allaah in their view. And they say it (His Speech) is just a meaning existing in Himself, He the Most Perfect and Most High. As for the words, then it is the speech of a created being meaning it is from the speech of Jibreel or from the speech of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they made the Qur&#8217;aan to be composed of two things, from something created and from something not created. So they did not come to be with the People of the Sunnah and say that the Qur&#8217;aan is not created. And they were not with the Jahmiyyah and said that the Qur&#8217;aan all of it is created. Rather they were <strong>waverers (neither here nor there)</strong>. Just like the saying of the Christians with regard to the Messiah, that he was composed of two things, of the divine and the human. And they say that the human and divine became as one. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary this matter is very great. And do not be intimidated by the traitors, those who claim that they are from the People of the Sunnah, and those who say, “This matter does not warrant all of this arguing. And Imam Ahmad went beyond the limit when he refused to say that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And this matter does not warrant all of this.” This is present in the writings of some of those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, and some who say, “What happened between Imam Ahmad and his opponents was just a political disagreement.” But if you carefully reflect, you will find that this matter is not something slight. Because if it is denied that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, then what remains with us? If the Lord has the Attribute of Speech removed from Him, then this will be a deficiency in the Lord, the Perfect. Because the one who does not speak is not an ilaah (is not one who is deserving of worship). And Allaah, the Perfect, He rebuked the Jews when they worshipped the calf and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they not see that it (the calf) does not speak to them.</span></strong> (Sooratul- A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it must be the case that the Lord speaks. And He controls and He commands and He forbids. So therefore if Speech is negated for Allaah, then it would be the case that He is not deserving of divinity and the right to worship. High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. So this is a tremendous matter. Therefore Imaam Ahmad rahimahullaah took the stance that he took, the stance of the unshakable mountains, and he would not give in, and he did not make any exceptions for himself. And he had patience upon the trial and he had patience upon imprisonment and upon being lashed and upon being demeaned by three khaleefahs (Caliphs), al-Ma·moon, al-Mu`tasim and al-Waathiq. Each one of them followed on in succession upon torturing him. They wanted him to give in, but he refused rahimahullaah and he remained firm. At the end of the time of al-Waathiq (the last of the three), it is said that he turned back from this, when there was a debate between a scholar from the People of the Sunnah and between Bishr al-Mareesee and (Bishr) al-Mareesee was defeated, and at that point al-Waathiq turned back. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, this is a tremendous matter and it is very important and must not be treated lightly. And it may not be said, as some of the ignorant people and some of the writers and the intellectuals say, or the Ash`arees or those who follow their way, they say, “This is a matter which does not warrant all of this importance and all of these refutations.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imam Ahmad used as a proof against them His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So that he may hear the Speech of Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thus did Allaah say before.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah said,” so He affirmed for Himself Speech and Sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and His Revelation sent down,”</strong> meaning the Qur&#8217;aan. He sent it down to His Prophet Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam through the intermediary Jibreel, `alayhis-salaam. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Trustworthy Spirit </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jibreel, `alayhis-salaam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> descended with it </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Qur&#8217;aan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> to your heart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(heart of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> so that you should be from the warners in a clear Arabic tongue </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(language)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayaat 193-195)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is clear and very apparent. Yet despite this there are some who come and say, “The Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing, not something sent down, and Allaah did not speak with it and Allaah is not described with Speech.” High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and it is His Light.”</strong> The Qur&#8217;aan is described as being Light. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But rather We made it a Light, by which We guide whomever We wish from our servants</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is called Rooh, life or spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We revealed to you a Rooh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Spirit/Life/Soul)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> from our Command</span></strong>. (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rooh, a Spirit or Life, because the hearts come to life through it (the Qur&#8217;aan), just as the bodies come to life through a spirit/soul. So it is a Spirit/Soul for the hearts. And the well-known soul is a soul for the bodies. So therefore it (the Qur&#8217;aan) is Light, and it is a Spirit and it is Guidance, and it is a Reminder and it is Admonitions, and it has many names, which shows its greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“because the Qur&#8217;aan is from Allaah and that which is from Allaah is not created.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, along with His Names and His Attributes, is not created. So He is the Creator and everything besides Him is something created. And it cannot be said that the Names and Attributes are created, because they are from Allaah, and that which is from Allaah is not created, meaning Allaah has them as His Attributes. So Allaah with His Names and His Attributes is the Creator and whatever is besides Him is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And likewise Maalik ibn Anas and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy upon them, said,”</strong> This is the saying of the Imaams. And from them was Maalik, the Imaam of the abode of Hijrah (al-Madeenah), and Imaam Ahmad, the one who was tortured for that and who was harmed, may Allaah have mercy upon him, and he had patience; and others besides them from the Imaams of AhlusSunnah. This was their saying. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever came before them from the jurists (the scholars of fiqh) and whoever came after them.”</strong> Meaning, Imaam Maalik and Imaam Ahmad were not alone in this saying. Rather it was said by those who came before them from the Companions and the taabi`een and the successors of the taabi`een. And whoever came after them from the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And disputation about it is disbelief.”</strong> [05] Disputing about the Qur&#8217;aan, whether it is something created or whether it is something not created or a person having doubts and saying, “I don’t know, there is disagreement about this matter,” as people say now. So a manifestation has now appeared where they say, “The matter is khilaafiyyah/there is disagreement about this matter”. So we say: When there is disagreement, then what is to be followed is the daleel, the proof. We were not given the duty in the Religion of having to follow the disagreements of the people and sayings of the people. We have being given the duty in the Religion of following the proof. So when there is disagreement we test the disagreement against the proof. And whatever that is found to be supported by the proof, then it is the Truth. And whatever is contrary to the proof, then it is false. And Allaah did not abandon us to opinions and sayings and disagreements. Rather He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if you disagree in anything, then refer it back to Allaah and to the Messenger.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said in his book, Usoolus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah and it is not created. And a person should not be too weak to say, ‘It is not created.’ Because the Speech of Allaah is not something separate from Him. And there is nothing from Him that is created.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you disagree about, then its judgement is to be referred back to Allaah. That is Allaah my Lord. Upon Him I place my reliance and to Him I turn constantly.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to refer back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And whatever is supported by proof is to be taken, and whatever is contrary to the proof is to be left. And as for the person who takes a saying which conforms to his desires or his whims, even if it goes against the proof, then he is one who is astray; and this one is worshipping his own desires. As for the person who is worshipping Allaah, then he takes that which is supported by the proof from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Transcriber’s note: meaning resemblance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam ath-Thahabee, in his book Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa· in volume 11, in the biography of <strong>Ibn Kullaab (the founder of what is called the Ash`aree creed)</strong>, said, “Abul-`Abbaas al-Baghawee said, “Thaythoon the Christian said to me, ‘May Allaah have mercy upon `Abdullaah (Ibn Kullaab). He used to come to me in the church and he used to take things from me and if he had lived, we would have turned the Muslims into Christians.’ So it was said to this Christian man Thaythoon, ‘What do you say about the Messiah (`Eesaa)?’ He said, ‘What the people of your way said about the Qur&#8217;aan.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> That story is mentioned in a footnote from Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa· by Imaam ath-Thahabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Al-Laalikaa·ee reports in his book, Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah, from Aboo Uways who said, “I heard my maternal uncle, Maalik ibn Anas, and a group of the scholars mention the Qur&#8217;aan and they said, ‘<em>It is the Speech of Allaah, and it is from Him and there is nothing from Him which is created.</em>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There is a hadeeth which directly states it reported by Aboo Daawood as hadeeth 4603 declared hasan saheeh, good authentic, by Shaykh al-Albaanee from Aboo Hurayrah, from the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that he said: “<em>Disputation about the Qur&#8217;aan is disbelief</em>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And no one says regarding the Attributes of the Lord, the Most High, “How?” and “Why?” except for one who doubts about Allaah, the Exalted and Most High.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kayfiyya (how) is not to be asked about. And the reason why He said such and such, is not to be asked about. Rather one should submit to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because no one knows the how except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “No one will say, ‘Why (is that)?’ with regard to Allaah’s Attributes except one who doubts about the Attributes of Allaah, the Most High. A person who is always afflicted with ‘Why (is this)?’ and ‘How (is that)?’ and this saying comes out upon the slips of his tongue, this person is in danger. Indeed he is at the limit of danger. And for this reason the Companions, when revelation came down to them, they believed in it with certainty and they attested to it. And they did not ask ‘Why is this?’ and ‘How (is that)?’ Rather they submitted to everything which Allaah informed of open heartedly and accepting it fully. So therefore they did not ask ‘Why?’ and ‘How?’”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this <strong>Part B</strong> audio, the last paragraph in the above point is covered.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Our Lord is The First, without any ‘when’. And He is The Last, without any end.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is The First without any beginning and The Last without any end. He, the Most High, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) is The First and The Last and The Uppermost and The One who is Closest</strong></span> (Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are names which are opposites. ‘The First’ (Al-Owwal) is opposite to ‘The Last’ (Al-Aakhir). ‘The Uppermost’ (Az-Zaahir) is opposite to ‘The Closest’ (AlBaatin). And the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained this aayah in his saying: You are The First, and there is nothing before You. And You are The Last, so there is nothing after You. And You are The Uppermost One, so there is nothing above You. And You are The Closest One, so there is nothing closer than You. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the explanation of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. But then there came those people who explained it with other than the explanation of the Messenger (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) who say, “Az-Zaahir means ‘one who became apparent to the intellects’ and ‘who became apparent through clear proofs’, and it does not mean that He is above the created beings or that He is above the Throne!” So this is false and futile, contrary to the explanation of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. The one from the people who knows best about Allaah is Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And he has explained this aayah with a clear explanation, that ‘The First One’ means the One whom there is nothing before Him: “The First with no beginning.” And ‘The Last one’ He is the One whom there is nothing after Him: “The Last with no end.” And “The Uppermost” is the One whom there is nothing above Him. He is above all created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He is The Invincible Subduer above His servants. And He is The All Wise, The All Aware.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (Allaah) He is the Invincible Subduer above His servants. And He sends down guardians over you. (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has exaltedness (being above and exalted) with regard to His Self (Thaat). And He has exaltedness of Status (Qadr). And He has exaltedness in Supremacy (Qahr). <strong>“And You are The One who is Closest so there is nothing closer than you&#8230;”</strong> meaning that He knows everything. Nothing at all is hidden from Him. So He, along with the fact that He is above His created beings, then along with this, nothing is hidden from Him, from the innermost secrets and what their chests conceal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatever is hidden from Allaah, in the earth nor in the heavens</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then people come who say, “Allaah the Majestic and Most High is not above and He is not beneath, and He is not to the right and He is not to the left, and He is not inside the Universe and He is not outside the Universe.” The meaning of this would be that He does not exist as occurs in the books of the people of kalaam (people of theological rhetoric).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He knows what is secret and what is most hidden. And He is ascended upon His Throne.”</strong> So His knowing whatever is upon the earth and whatever is beneath the earth and whatever is under the soil, this does not contradict His being above His Throne. Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, encompasses everything and nothing encompasses Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And the whole of the creation in comparison to Him is just tiny, like nothing at all. And He is Al-`Azeem, The Tremendously Great One; Al-Kabeer, The Incomparably Great One; Al-Muta`aal, The Supreme and Exalted One; Al-Jaleel, The Majestic and Supreme &#8211; He the Perfect and Most High. So we do not make analogy between Him and ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They have not given Allaah the respect and honour which is due to Him, and the whole earth will be grasped by Him on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Perfect and Exalted is He and far removed from that which they associate with Him</strong></span>. (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), aayah 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the created things are, in relation to Him, like nothing. Even if they are very great in the eyes of the people, but with respect to Him they are like nothing. (They are nothing) before His Tremendousness, He the Perfect and Most High. People, they do not give the honour and respect to Allaah that is His due when they deny His Ability and His Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind, a similitude has been struck for you so listen to it. Those whom you call upon besides Allaah could never create even a fly, even if they gathered together to do it. And if the fly were to take something from them (those idols) they cannot rescue it from it. Weak is the seeker and the one sought.2 They do not give Allaah His due honour and respect.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hajj (22), aayahs 73-74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not recognise the Tremendousness of Allaah and His Ability and His Supremeness and His Knowledge. So therefore they draw analogy between Him and themselves. Therefore they belittle Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If you people, all of you together, from the first of you to the last of you, all the jinn and all mankind, were to gather together to create a fly, the smallest thing, they would not be able to do so. Particularly whom they call upon besides Allaah, from those objects of worship and those false lords.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They could never create a fly even if they all gathered together to do it. If the most proficient doctors gathered, and the cleverest people in the world and the craftsmen and the inventors, and you were to say to them, “Produce a fly for us,” they would not be able to do it &#8211; even though they are able to build huge ocean liners which contain airstrips and carry aeroplanes, and they can build huge aeroplanes. They are able to build these things. As for creating a fly and putting life into it, then they are not able to do it. They can draw a picture of a fly and of a person and of wild animals and the like, but they are not able to make any such thing walk and talk. They can just draw it with its details only. As for breathing life into it, then this is from the command of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So therefore how can analogy be made between the Creator, the Majestic and Most High, and the creation. He is not reached by the intellects and people’s thoughts, and He cannot be imagined by their thinking, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. And He is ascended over His throne.”</strong> His being ascended over His Throne does not contradict His knowing whatever is hidden and whatever is most secret. So it may not be said that because He has ascended over His throne He is therefore distant from the people and He does not hear and does not see therefore, for this is claiming tashbeeh, that there is likeness between the Lord and the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, all things are the same to Him. Nothing is hidden from Him, He the Perfect and Most High; something close or something far, the first of the creation and the last of them, this world or the Hereafter. All of it is within the Knowledge of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And therefore this gigantic creation is caused to proceed by Him, He the Perfect, and by His Ability and His Will and His Creating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah holds the heavens and the earth, so that they do not move away. And if they were to move away, then no one besides Him, could hold them. Indeed He is Forbearing and He forgives extensively</span> </strong>(Soorah Faatir(35), aayah 41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The orbit of the stars, the Sun and the Moon in its precise calculated manner which does not alter and does not err and does not slip, who is the One who ordered it with this arrangement? He is Allaah the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Moon and the stars proceed in an orderly manner until Allaah wishes the end of this world and moving on to the Hereafter. The One who ordered it is All Wise and All Knowing, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you were to reflect upon this creation, then you would realise the greatness of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So when the people see a precise machine they marvel at this skill, and at its maker, but it is a small thing; then how about this whole creation which does not fail. Who causes it to persist and who preserves it? Who is the One who preserves this creation, all of it, so that it does not alter and does not fail and does not miss out on anything? He is Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these created things, the small ones and the large ones, who brings provision to them? Huge created things, who is the One who produced provision for them, for each one in accordance with its own condition? He is Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we should submit to that which came from Allaah, because He knows best about Himself, and that we submit to what came from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam because the Messenger is the one from the creation who knows best about his Lord, He the Perfect and Most High; and that we do not raise objections and we do not interfere with our intellects and our own thinking. So there is no contradiction between the fact that “He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden” and “He is ascended over His throne.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying,<strong> “And His knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His knowledge.”</strong> His knowledge is in every place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatever is hidden from Allaah, in the earth nor in the heavens.</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah) knows whatever is in the land and in the sea. And no leaf falls except that He knows it. And there is no grain in the darkest depths of the earth, nor anything fresh, nor anything dry, except that it is written in a clear book. (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah) is the One who takes your souls by night. Meaning in sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He knows whatever you do&#8230;<br />
Meaning ‘whatever (deeds) you earn’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;in the day. Then He raises you up in it.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning you get up from sleep. Who caused you to sleep in the first place? And who is it that causes you to wake up? He is Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So if you were to think about this creation, then this would lead you to realize the Greatness of Allaah and you would submit to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; if you were to reflect upon the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and what he informed about with regard to events of the past and of the future, things which have occurred just as he informed sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Who guided him to know that? It was Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. He is the One who revealed it to him. It was not from himself; rather it was just from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If you were to compare the ahaadeeth (sayings of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) to the events that have occurred, you would be amazed. The Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned to us about the lives of the Prophets and the previous nations (he mentioned) a great deal (of that), even though his time was much later. Who made him aware of this? It was Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So this is indeed a proof that he is a Messenger from Allaah. This tremendous Qur·aan, it is not possible that it could have come from other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, if the whole of mankind and jinn were to gather together to bring the like of this Qur·aan, they could not bring its like, even if they all tried to help each other.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from the speech of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And the Messenger was just one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this Qur&#8217;aan has been sent by Revelation to me to warn you with it and to warn whomever it reaches.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he was one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 11 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363826523&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-the-most-high-is-an-innovation-misguidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Kalaam, speech/rhetorical theology/theological rhetoric, with regard to the Lord, the Most High, is something new and it is an innovation and misguidance.”</strong> Meaning, theological rhetoric, kalaam, with regard to the Self of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and with regard to His Names and His Attributes, is a newly introduced affair. It was introduced by the people of misguidance, those who do not submit to the texts and who do not have fear of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore they speak about the Self of the Lord, and they speak about His Names and His Attributes, and they deny and they negate that which Allaah affirmed for Himself or that which His Messenger affirmed for Him. And they bring opinions from themselves. (And they say) “This is what is correct.” They speak in explanation of the texts with other than their correct explanation, or they say, “We don’t understand them.” They say, “We leave and entrust them to Allaah.” And the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger becomes just like foreign/non-Arabic speech which the Arabs do not understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslims is that they continue upon the correct path, upon the way of the Salaf and that they do not give any attention to those people who mislead others, those who argue about Allaah without any proof which He has given them. They dispute about the Qur·aan and they dispute about the Sunnah. Their affair is just argumentation. So it is obligatory to beware of those people. Those people are not people who are followers (of the Truth); rather they are innovators who are just following their desires. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And nothing is to be said about the Lord except that which He described Himself with, He the Mighty and Majestic, in the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong> Having forbidden argumentation about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and arguments/debates about the Names of Allaah and His Attributes, he now explains what is obligatory. And it is that we affirm the Qur·aan and the Sunnah just as they came upon their meaning, the meaning taken from the Arabic language with which the Qur·aan and the Sunnah came down. So al `ilm, knowledge, its meaning is well known in the language. Likewise al-wajh, the face, is well known. And al-`ayn, eyes, and al-yad, hands, and al-istiwaa·, ascending, and al-`uloow, being high above, all of these and their like, their meaning is well known in the Arabic language in which the Qur·aan came down. Whereas the people of misguidance, they say “This speech is not in accordance with what is apparent from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then they divide into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• A category who say, “We stop and withhold. And we say what is apparent is not what is meant; but then we do not understand what is actually meant by it.” And they are the <strong>Mufowwidah</strong> the people of <strong>tafweed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And the second category are the <strong>Mu&#8217;owwillah</strong>, the people of <strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong>, who give false interpretations. And they are more in number; they are the majority out of these two groups. They interpret with other than their correct meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went astray and they lead others astray and they preoccupy the people. And they fill up books with these debates, with arguments and disputations which lead to nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is to submit to what occurs in the Book and in the Sunnah with regard to the Names of Allaah and His Attributes as was meant by Allaah and His Messenger, because Allaah knows best about Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and He knows best about other than Himself. And the most knowledgeable one from the creation about Allaah is the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. As for us, then our knowledge falls short. There are many things that we do not know related to our own selves with regard to the details of our bodies and the veins and the senses. There are things which we do not know. Do you know the rooh, about the soul? What exactly is it? The intellect, what is it? If you do not know something from your own body, nor something about your own self, then how can you speak about the Self of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, which is not known, except to Him, He, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge</strong></span> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is outside what they know and outside what they can imagine. And no analogy can be made between Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and His creation. This would be a belittlement of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So He knows best about His Self and about other than Himself. And He is the One who is truest in saying and better in speech than His creation, as Shaykhul-Islaam rahimahullaah said in al-Waasitiyyah [03].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and what Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions.”</strong> The issue of the Names and Attributes hinges upon the Book and the Sunnah. And their explanation is also in the Book and the Sunnah, and the language of the Arabs in which the Legislation came down. And we do not go to the logic of Aristotle and Plato, or so and so, or such and such. This is a crime against the Legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is a case of replacing the Revelation with logic and `ilmul-kalaam, theological rhetoric. And what fruit did theological rhetoric and argumentation produce for those people with regard to misguidance and ruin and loss. And they did not reach any result. And this is by their own admission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They expended their whole lives in debating and disputations, and in the end they acknowledged that they did not reached any result. And if only they had submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, they would have found relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore one of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“The result of using the intellects is just that the mind is tied in knots</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And most of the striving of the people is just misguidance</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And our spirits are forlorn strangers within our bodies</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And all the results that come about in this world for us are just harm and an evil climate</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we did not benefit from our studies through our whole lives except that we just gathered they said and such and such said (idle speech).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they came to a state of doubt and uncertainty. And as for those who submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger, then they were saved and at peace from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance say also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“Upon my life, I have gone around all of the institutions of learning</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I have looked upon all those places</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I did not see except one who is putting his palm</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> upon his chin in confusion or one who is striking his teeth in regret.”</em></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went around all the institutes of learning, institutes of theological rhetoric and logic and debating and he examined them and did not find in them that which could remedy the need to know. And he said [06]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have carefully considered the different paths of theological rhetoric and the ways of the philosophers. And I did not see them remedying the sick [07] nor quenching the thirst of the person with extreme thirst. And I saw that the closest path was the way of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read with regard to affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The good word ascends to Him.</strong></span> (Soorah Faatir (35), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended upon the Throne.</span></strong> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And read with regard to negation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they do not encompass Him with knowledge</span></strong>. (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 110) ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One. There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing.”</strong></span> He is, He the Perfect, One. No one shares with Him with regard to His Self nor with regard to His Names and His Attributes nor with regard to His Creating and His Actions nor with regard to His worship. There is no sharer and no partner for Him. So why therefore tire yourself out? You are a created being and He is the Creator. How can the created being encompass knowledge of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High? So you, your role is just to submit to Allaah and to His Messenger and not to dispute and not to argue and not to tire yourself out and to tire other people out. This is what is obligatory and binding. And therefore the Companions, they did not engage themselves in these unnecessary matters. And they did not withhold with regard to an aayah or with regard to a hadeeth. Rather they affirmed it and submitted to it and held what it contained as their creed and belief, and they never had any problems arise, ever. So the matter is a matter requiring submission and compliance. And that we do not delve into matters of creed and belief in the way which the people of disputation and the people of kalaam, theological rhetoric, and people of logic delved into it. Such that the result was, as they themselves admitted regarding themselves, that they ended up in a state of bewilderment and confusion and not reaching any result, as one of them said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We didn’t benefit anything from our studies, throughout our whole lives Except in the end we just gathered idle speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Meaning), so and so said and so and so said. And if he says such and such then the response is such and such. [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “Meaning by that, speech which was introduced by the Jahmiyyah with regard to delving into speaking about Attributes of Allaah without knowledge. But as for describing (giving as an Attribute) that which Allaah described Himself with or which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, then this is something required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] This occurs in al-`Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] These lines of poetry are by al-Fakhrur-Raazee. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] These lines of poetry are by ash-Shahristaanee, the author of the book al-Milal wan-Nahl. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] This is a quote from ar-Raazee quoted from him in the book an-Nuboowaat of Shaykhul-Islaam (ibn Taymeeyah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s note:</strong> curing the one who has a need for knowledge</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Shaykh as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said, “Then he made clear that it is obligatory to describe Allaah with that which He described Himself with, and that which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, without tahreef, distorting the meaning, without ta`teel, denying/depriving it of meaning, without takyeef, saying how, and without tamtheel, likening the Creator to the creation, in accordance with His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him (Allaah); and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “There is nothing like Him;” this is negation. And, “and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing;” this is affirmation. And it contains a proof for detailed affirmation and for general and concise negation. Because His Saying, “There is nothing like Him,” this is a general and concise and negation. It negates everything that can be imagined or can cross the mind. And “and He is The Hearing, The Seeing,” this is affirmation in detail. And this aayah is a tremendous principle with regard to affirming the Attributes along with declaring Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, free of whatever does not befit Him.</p>

Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><span class="fontstyle0">4.  ولا شيء يعجزه‏<br />
And nothing renders Him incapable;</span> </span></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F357043148&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-is-al-qadir-nothing-renders-him-incapable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an affirmation of the perfection of His Power and Ability. Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He (Allaah) has full power over everything</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah was and is fully capable of everything</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) always was and is All-Knowing, All-Powerful</strong></span><br />
(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And القَدِير (<em>Al-Qadeer</em>) means: the One who is extremely powerful. So His Power, He the Perfect and Most High, is such that there is nothing that can cause Him to be unable. Whenever He wants something He just says to it, “<strong>Be</strong>” and it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains affirmation of the <em>qudrah</em> (قدرة &#8211; power and ability) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it contains affirmation that His Power includes and covers everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term that some authors use (about Allaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has full power over whatever he wants,” this wording is an error because Allaah did not restrict His Power to His Will. Rather, He said (about Himself),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>(Allaah) has full Power over everything</strong>.” So therefore you should say that which Allaah the Perfect and Most High said about Himself. This (a similar statement) only occurs in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them (the people) together when He Wishes</strong></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because, the gathering of the creation has a certain time in the future and He is fully able to gather them at that time, meaning, the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever creatures He has created and spread within them. And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them together when He Wishes.</strong></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [4][1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And there is nothing which causes Allaah to be incapable”</strong>: This is a denial but what is meant by it is not a mere denial because denial on its own is not from the belief of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; rather, it is the position of the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah then their way is the way of the Qur.aan which gives a general denial of certain things for Allaah and gives a detailed affirmation of Attributes for Him. And whenever there is a denial then the denial is there to affirm something which is its perfect opposite. So this denial is there because of affirmation of its perfect opposite i.e. nothing renders Him incapable because of the perfection of His Power and Ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further side point: In his explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz said regarding <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em>: Affirming attributes for Allaah when the creation have the like of those attributes, for example, affirming that Allaah is the All-Knowing when we affirm that the creation has knowledge and affirming that Allaah has Sight when the creation has sight and affirming that Allaah has a Hand when the creation has hands. This fact is what leads the <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> into denying certain attributes because they say that if you affirm for Allaah a Hand then you are declaring Him like the creation and if we affirm for Allaah a Face then amongst the creation we have faces, so if we affirm a Face for Allaah then we will be making Him like the creation. So therefore they deny any Hand for Allaah and deny any Face for Allaah and so on with other attributes as well. They say that in that way they will stay clear of making the Creator like the creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Based upon the work of Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</strong><br />
<strong>Explained by Dr Saleh As-Saleh, rahimahumaa Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable and greatest knowledge is the knowledge of Allaah, whom there is no God except Him, the true God, the Lord of all that exists. And the knowledge of Allaah is the basis of every other knowledge, for the one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him.</p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-knowledge-of-allaah-is-the-basis-of-every-other-knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him, and the one who is ignorant of Allaah is therefore by all means ignorant of every other thing.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ نَسُوا اللَّـهَ فَأَنسَاهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ ۚ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And be not like those who forgot Allaah, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient.’</span> {Suraah Anfaal 8: 47}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And don’t be like those who forgot Allaah- because of their disobedience, so He let them forget their own selves- for they were not able to do righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate this aaayah, you will find a noble and honourable meaning and a great one implicated in this verse that anyone who forgets Allaah, Allaah will make him forget his own self, and therefore will not realise his reality nor would he realise that which benefits or harms him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will be crippled like cattle, even cattle could be more knowledgeable of its benefits in this sense. What is meant is that<strong> the knowledge of Allaah is the basis and foundation of every other knowledge and it is the basis of the slave of Allaah to know of his happiness, and to perfect his affairs and to work for his other life</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore he would properly estimate Allaah, the proper estimation He deserves. And it will lead him to be shy of Allaah, out of love and magnification- his heart being attached to Him, yearning to meet Allaah and be close to Him, turning His affairs to Him and having awe and fear of Him. And mankind, with this respect, differ in such an estimation of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  said in invocation to Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[صحيح مسلم و غيره]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You (o Allaah) are as You have praised Yourself’</span> [Muslim and others]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  indicating those most knowledgeable of Allaah, even invoke Allaah with this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You are as You have praised Yourself (O Allaah)’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Love and eagerness</strong> are matters that follow the knowledge of Allaah, so the knowledge of Allaah brings forth and leads to love of Him and yearning to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefor the knowledge of Allaah, is the most great and honorable knowledge and this leads to the proper estimation of Allaah, loving Him and eagerness to meet Him. The more a person is knowledgeable of Allaah, the more perfection he is in his love of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad therefore ‘<strong>whoever believes in Allaah and His names and attributes</strong>’ and knows of Him in this respect will love Him more, and then he would achieve a state of sweetness in his heart, and this sweetness puts him in a state whereby he will always love to meet Allaah and be close to Him, and to sense and look at His Face, and listen to Him and to His words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The knowledge itself leads to the proper estimation of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik ibn Dinaar rahimahullaah said ‘<span style="color:#993300;">the people of this life they left it and didn’t take the best of it</span>,’ they said to him, ‘and what is it o Abaa Yahya?’ He said, ‘knowing  of Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who know of Allaah are the ones who have really tasted what is best in this life, and that is the knowledge of Allaah in this life as Maalik bin Dinaar stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّـهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُوا مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ ۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And they did not appraise Allaah with true appraisal when they said, &#8220;Allaah did not reveal to a human being anything.&#8221;’</span> {Suraah Al-An’aam 6: 91}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They (kuffar) did not estimate Allaah with the estimation due to Him’ when they said that Allaah sent nothing down to the human being- so what is meant by saying what is due to Him is what is meant by the proper estimation of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When the knowledge of Allaah is strengthened then his eagerness for Allaah also strengthens.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah ibn Masoud radhi Allaahu anhu said, ‘the believer will not feel at rest without the meeting of his Lord Allaah, therefore anyone who sets his resting coat in this life in the meeting of Allaahسبحانه و تعلى, then it is as if He has reached that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the believer would not have any real rest without being keen about the matter of meeting Allaah, yearning so that he can reach Him. As Allaah سبحانه و تعلى says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allaah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allaah hearts are assured.&#8221;</span> {Suraah Ar-Ra’ad 13: 28}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what ibn Masoud was speaking about in his saying that there will be no real rest for the believer unless he meets Allaahسبحانه و تعلى; therefore this matter should be alive, as mentioned in the aayah in Suraatur Ra’ad, they will achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave the prophets عليهم السلام the choice between increasing their stay on earth or death, and they would choose the meeting with Allaah the most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Imaam Bukhaari entitled the chapter in his saheeh &#8211; &#8220;the one who loves to meet Allaah, Allaah will love to meet Him&#8221;. Under this chapter he gave the situation with the prophet  from his wife,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">حدثنا بشر بن محمد حدثنا عبد الله قال يونس قال الزهري أخبرني سعيد بن المسيب في رجال من أهل العلم أن عائشة قالت كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول وهو صحيح إنه لم يقبض نبي حتى يرى مقعده من الجنة ثم يخير فلما نزل به ورأسه على فخذي غشي عليه ثم أفاق فأشخص بصره إلى سقف البيت ثم قال اللهم الرفيق الأعلى فقلت إذا لا يختارنا وعرفت أنه الحديث الذي كان يحدثنا وهو صحيح قالت فكانت آخر كلمة تكلم بها اللهم الرفيق الأعلى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">موطأ مالك, صحيح البخاري, صحيح مسلم, مسند أحمد</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said, ‘Rasoolullah صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, ‘no prophets soul will be taken by Allaah until he sees his seat in Paradise then he will be given the choice’ so when he صلى الله عليه وسلم  became ill and the moment of death approached and his head was on my thigh, when he صلى الله عليه وسلم used to go into the state of unconsciousness and woke up, finally I saw him gaze in the direction of the roof and said ‘O Allaah, the Highest companionship.’ Aisha said, ‘so I knew he didn’t choose us, and I remember the statement he  صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say to us and it is true. And the last words he spoke was ‘Allaahumma rafeequl a’laa.’ (O Allaah, the Highest companionship)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muwatta of Maalik, Bukhaari, Muslim and Ahmed (with slight difference in wording)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how is it that these rough hearts and stone hearts are able to accuse other Muslims when they speak about knowing Allaah’s names and attributes and defending them in the proper way, as Allaah intended and as Allaah affirmed for Himself, and by the prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah: Lesson 30   : Point [121] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> </strong><strong>ونَقُولُ‏:‏ إِنَّ اللهَ اتخَذَ إبراهيمَ خَلِيلاً، وكَلَّمَ اللهُ مُوسى تكْلِيماً، إِيماناً وتَصْدِيقاً وتَسْلِيماً</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[121]  And we say that Allaah took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (<em><u>Kh</u>aleel</em>) and that Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa, saying that with <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and testifying to the truth and with full submission.</span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-took-ibraaheem-as-khaleel-and-that-allaah-spoke-directly-to-moosaa-dawud-burbank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]</strong><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [121]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the Muslims, is that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) are the most excellent of the creation and that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) vary in levels of excellence. So they hold as their creed and belief, that Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <em><u>Kh</u>aleel</em> (an especially beloved one) just as Allaah, the Most High, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;..and Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>Kh</u>aleel (an especially beloved)&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>‘al-<u>kh</u>ullah’</em> (الخلة), it means: the highest of the levels of love. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has love for His believing servants and for the <em>muttaqeen</em> ( المتقين &#8211; the people of <em>taqwaa</em> – those are dutiful to Him) and He has love for the <em>mu<u>h</u>sineen</em> (المحسنين &#8211; the doers of good) and He loves those who frequently repent (التوابين &#8211; <em>at-tawwaabeen</em>) and He loves <em>al-mutta<u>t</u>ahhireen</em> (المتطهرين – those people who purify themselves). However, <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> is a special degree which has not been attained except by two of the creation: Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. Just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Allaah took me as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel) just as He took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel).”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) gave excellence to some of the Prophets over others, even though all of them were upon a very high level. However, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, gave excellence to some over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those are the Messengers; We gave excellence to some of them over others. From them are those to whom Allaah spoke directly and He raised some in degrees of excellence.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every Prophet was given by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, a degree of excellence particular to him. So he gave to Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam, al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> (that He made them His specially beloved). And He gave to Moosaa the excellence that He spoke to him directly, without an angel in-between. And Moosaa heard His Speech; so He the Perfect called to him (ناداه &#8211; <em>naadaahu</em>) and spoke privately to him (ناجاه &#8211; <em>naajaahu</em>). And the term <em>‘al-munaadaat’</em> (المنادات) means ‘a raised voice’ and <em>‘al-munaajaat’</em> (المناجات) is ‘speaking with a low voice’. Both of these occurred for Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and this was a virtue not attained by anyone besides him. And He said at the end of the <em>aayah, “takleemaa</em> (تكليما – with Speech)” for emphasis so that no one could say that this was something metaphorical. So when He has emphasized it with this verbal noun, this proves that it is true and real Speech from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So this contains affirmation of <em>al-Kalaam</em> (الكلام – Speech) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And it contains affirmation of the virtue of Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> over other Prophets with regard to this characteristic. <strong>And the fact that a Prophet had a particular quality special to him does not necessitate that he is better than the others unrestrictedly. Rather, it means that he was more excellent than other Prophets with regard to this particular quality.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [15]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the amazing affairs of His ability, that He causes the creation to die and causes them to pass away so that they are destroyed and become dust and remains – such that an ignorant person would say, ‘It is not possible for these to be restored’. However Allaah the Mighty and Majestic will resurrect them again, and He will restore their creation anew. And He will have no difficulty in doing this, as He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The creation of you all, and the resurrection of you all is just like that of a single soul.</span></em> (Soorah Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>28)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He (Allaah) it is One who creates initially, and then He repeats it (the creation); and that is even easier for Him.  And for Him is the Highest Description in the heavens and in the earth.  And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, they denied the resurrection, holding it to be something far-fetched, just as Allaah said about them, (that the unbelieving man would say)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Who will give life to these bones when they are crumbled away?&#8221;</em></span> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Perfect and Most High, said in response,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “He will give life to them Who created them for the first time!”</span> </em> </strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first time they did not exist at all, so He brought them into existance from nothing, He the Perfect and Most High. So, the One who created them from non-existence, is He not able even more so to bring them back into existence? This is correct in accordance with the people’s intellect but otherwise, analogy cannot be made between Allaah, the Perfect, and His creation.  So this is just stated as a similitude,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And for Him is the Highest Description</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this a refutation of the denier, Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he forgets his (own) creation</span></em> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he forgets that in the beginning he was nothing; he did not exist at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Has there come upon man a time when he was nothing mentioned? </span></em>(Sooratul-Insaan (76), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: this man, he forgets that Allaah produced him from non-existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed gather together these separated bones, shredded flesh, disintigrated dust and these scattered hairs, and He will restore them as they once were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His (Allaah’s) Signs is that the heaven and the earth are established by His Command.  Then, when He calls you with a single call, you will come out from the earth.</em></span> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is upon the earth will faint and die, except whomever Allaah wishes.  And then it will be blown again and they will be standing up, looking on.</span></em> (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second blowing is the blowing for the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the first blowing of the horn, it is the blowing for the people to faint and die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and then the people will come out from their graves going quickly to their Lord.  They (the unbeliever) will say: &#8220;Woe to us! Who has taken us out from our place of sleep?&#8221; (The believer will respond) &#8220;This is what the Most Merciful promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth!&#8221; </span></em>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayaat </em>51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah indeed has Power and Ability over everything and this contains a refutation of the unbelievers, those who say that Allaah is unable to give life to the dead and to return them to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that We will not gather his bones together? Indeed, We are fully able even to put his fingertips together. </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) they will come out from the graves, hurrying as if they are racing to a finishing post. </span></em>(Sooratul-Ma`aarij (70), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the Power of Allaah, and His Will and His Wish.  Nothing makes Him incapable.  However, it is just that some of the creation, they draw analogy between Allaah and His creation and so therefore they hold that it is far-fetched that there will be any resurrection; because the person thinks in his view, that’s something impossible and he doesn’t look to the Power of Allaah and he doesn’t judge Allaah’s Power as He deserves; and this is a case of ignorance with regard to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [10]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like the wording which has already preceded: <strong>“<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/06/there-is-nothing-like-him-allaah/">And there is nothing like Him</a>.”[1]</strong> And the meaning of <em>al-anaam </em>(الأنام) is ‘the creation’.  So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, is free of any resemblance to the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/17/there-is-nothing-like-unto-him-and-he-is-the-all-hearing-the-all-seeing/"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearing the All-Seeing</em></span></a>.</strong> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is no equal for Him</strong>.</span></em> (Sooratul-I<u>kh</u>laa<u>s</u> (112), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He, the Perfect, is free from resembling His creation.  And even though He has Names and Attributes which correspond to names and attributes of the creation in their wording and in their meaning, however, in their reality and in how they are, there is no resemblance between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [10][2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Point [3] &#8211; Listen @ <a title="Permanent Link to There is nothing like Him (Allaah) – Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/06/there-is-nothing-like-him-allaah/" rel="bookmark">There is nothing like Him (Allaah) </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation, said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nu`aym ibn <u>H</u>ammaad</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“Whoever declares that Allaah is like anything from his creation then he has committed unbelief, and whoever denies anything from that which Allaah has described Himself with, then he has committed unbelief, and there is not in the attributes which Allaah has mentioned for Himself nor in the attributes which His Messenger mentioned for Him, any resemblance.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahawayh</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“Whoever describes Allaah and declares that His Attributes are like the attributes of anyone from Allaah’s creation then he is a <strong><em>kaafir</em> </strong>(disbeliever) in Allaah, the Tremendous One.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“The sign of Jahm and his companions is their claim against the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and the lies which they had instigated, that they say, ‘The people of the Sunnah are <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> (that they declare Allaah to be like His creation).’ But rather, it is just that they are <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (deniers of the attributes).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this was the saying of a great number of the imaams of the <em>Salaf – </em>the sign of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is that they call the people of the Sunnah <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbihah.  </em>Because there are none from the deniers of the Names and Attributes, except that he calls the one who affirms them a <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbih</em> (one who makes Allaah like the creation).  So whoever denies Allaah’s Names altogether, then they are from the extreme apostates – like the <em>Qaraami<u>t</u>ah</em> (القرامطة) and the philosophers.  And whoever says that it cannot be said about Allaah that He is has knowledge and (it cannot be said, they say, about Allaah) that He has power, claiming that whoever calls Allaah that is a <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbih.  </em>They say His Names are just metaphorical, like the extreme <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">[27]  {There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.}</span> </strong><br />
(a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F323059041&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [27]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a negation of <em>tashbeeh</em> &#8211; there being anything like Allaah, the One free of all imperfections. And the <em>kaaf</em> (in <u>ك</u>مثله) is to emphasize the negation, like (as occurs in a different <em>aayah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ عَلِيمًا</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">…and Allaah is Sufficient as a Knower. </span></em></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa. (4), <em>aayah </em>70)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In origin (it would usually be said): وكفى الله عليماً but the (extra) <em>baa’</em> (in <u>ب</u>الله) is for emphasis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And nothing whatsoever resembles Him – not the angels, and not the Prophets, and not the Messengers, and not the beloved servants of Allaah, nor any created being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">…and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span></em></strong> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He called Himself <strong><em>As-Samee’</em> </strong>(the All-Hearing One) <strong><em>Al-Ba<u>s</u>eer</em></strong> (the All-Seeing One).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the beginning of the <em>aayah </em>[1] contains a refutation of the <strong><em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> </strong>(those who liken Allaah to the Creation) and the end of it contains a refutation of the <strong><em>Mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em></strong> (those who deny Allaah’s Attributes). And it indicates that affirming His Names and Attributes does not necessitate resemblance to the created beings. So the hearing and seeing of the created beings does not resemble the Hearing and Seeing of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/how-a-common-person-from-the-people-of-tawheed-defeated-the-scholar-from-grave-worshippers" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/JJkuhC</a><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [24]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is nothing than can possibly do without or be independent of Allaah – no angel, nor any heaven nor any earth, nor anyone from the <em>jinn</em> nor anyone from mankind, nor any inanimate object, whether mountains or oceans; everything is dependent upon Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O mankind! You are the ones who are needy and dependent upon Allaah.  And Allaah, He is the One who is Independent – the One deserving of all praise.</em></span> (Sooratul-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything is dependent upon Him and not upon the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) and not upon the heavens.  And whoever says that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) have power and ability which is different to human power and ability, and whoever says that they have some control over the creation and that they benefit and harm, besides Allaah; then this is the saying of the unbelievers and the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em>.  So the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), and the Messengers and the angels, have no independence from Allaah and they cannot do anything without Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nullifies the worship of everything besides Allaah, whether idols or other things.  How can you worship things that are themselves dependent (upon Allaah) and forget the One in whose Hand is the Ownership and the Mastery of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for this reason one of the scholars from the grave-worshippers, he said to a common person from the people of <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, “You people say that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), they can’t benefit and they can’t bring harm.” So he said, “Yes, we say that they don’t bring benefit and they don’t bring harm.” So he (the grave-worshipper) said, “Does not Allaah, the Most High, say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not consider those who are killed in Allaah’s cause as being dead.  Rather, they are alive, with their Lord, being given provision.”</span></em> (Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So (this man who is only just a regular person) he responded to him and said, “Did Allaah say <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) or did He say <strong><em>yarzuqoon</em> </strong>(يَرْزُقون – they give provision)?” So the man said, “Rather He said, <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) with a <em><u>d</u>ammah</em> on the <em>yaa’</em>” So (the man who is a common person), he said, “In that case I will ask the One who Provides for them and I will not ask them.” So that person of knowledge was defeated in argument by the evidence of this common person who was upon the correct natural disposition.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [16]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the author, <strong>“<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/04/24/he-is-the-ancient-one-without-any-beginning-the-one-who-persists-without-any-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ancient One without any beginning</a>”</strong>[1] has already preceded.  So, there was nothing before Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And the meaning of that is that He has the Attributes of Perfection and His Attributes of Perfection are eternal; they have always existed and they always will.  So just as He is the First without any beginning, then likewise, His Attributes (are the same) since they are along with Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  So, they were always existing, just as Allaah the Perfect and Most High has always existed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not the case that He existed before without any Attributes and then Attributes came about for Him afterwards as the people of misguidance say; those who say, “He did not always have Attributes and then afterwards He came to have them.” They say so in order not to necessitate there being multiple lords deserving worship, as they claim, or multiple divinities in existence who are eternal, such that the Names and Attributes would be partners with Allaah in His Eternity.  So we say, “How free is Allaah of all deficiencies, <em>Sub<u>h</u>aanAllaah!</em>  This (saying) would necessitate that Allaah was deficient &#8211; High and Exalted is Allaah – that He was deficient for a period and then He came to have Attributes and so, became Perfect through those Attributes; High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  And the fact that His Attributes are eternal does not necessitate that there are other eternal lords.  Because the attributes are not something other than and outside the one who has those attributes.  Rather, they are meanings found in the one who has the attributes.  And an attribute is not something independent of the one who has the attribute. So if you say for example, “such and such person hears and he sees and he has knowledge of <em>fiqh</em> (he is a jurist) and he is a scholar of the language and he is a scholar of grammar” does it mean that this person has become many people? So having multiple attributes does not necessitate that the ones having the attributes are multiple as the people of misguidance have said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, His Attributes had no beginning just as His Self (<em><u>Dh</u>aat</em>) had no beginning.  So Allaah has the Attribute of being the Creator <em>(Al-<u>Kh</u>aaliq</em><em>)</em> always and forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the actions of (Allaah) the Perfect, then they are eternal with regard to their type, newly occurring with regard to actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, He was ‘the One who speaks’ before He actually spoke and He was ‘the Creator’ before He actually created anything and as for His speaking and His creating, then these are actions which newly occur and so on, to the rest of the actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[17] لم يزدد بكونهم شيئًا، لم يكن قبلهم من صفته.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[17]  He (Allaah) was not increased in any Attribute which He did not have before, by the creation of the creation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: His creating the creation.  We do not say that He did not become a Creator except after He created the people.  Rather, Allaah has been the Creator always, forever, without any beginning to that.  And as for His act of creating, then that is an action which occurs newly again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [17] <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[18] وكما كان بصفاته أزليًا، كذلك لا يزال عليها أبديًا.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[18] And just as He has always possessed His Attributes, then likewise, He will always possess them forever.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He has always has His Attributes forever, meaning: there was no beginning to that; then likewise, His Attributes will remain with Him, He the Perfect, in the future.  So He is Eternal, along with His Attributes; He has no end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنت الآخر فلا بعدك شيء</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“You are the Last One, so there is nothing after You.” </em></span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Last One with Your Names and Attributes.  So it is not to be said that these attributes will cease to be with Him in the future; rather, they will always be with Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [18] <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[19] ليس بعد خلق الخلق استفاد اسم ‏(‏الخالق‏)‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[19]     He did not acquire the Name ‘The Creator’ after the creation of the creation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clarification and a repetition of what has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[20] ولا بإحداث البرية استفاد اسم ‏(‏الباري‏)‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[20] Nor did He acquire the Name ‘<em>Al-Baaree’</em> (The Maker) after giving existence to the beings.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic is الباري (<em>Al-Baaree</em> – The Maker); meaning: The Creator.  برأ الخلق (<em>bara.a al-khalq</em>) means: He made them.  So, Allaah is <em>Al-Baaree</em> (The Maker of the creation).  And this Name goes along with Allaah’s Self &#8211; it has no beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [20]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[21] له معنى الربوبية ولا مربوب، ومعنى الخالق ولا مخلوق‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[21] He possessed the meaning of Lordship and Nurturing when there were no slaves, and He had the meaning of being the Creator without there being any creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So likewise, He was the <em>Rabb</em> (Lord and Nurturer) before anything existed for Him to be the Owner and the Master of.  And the meaning of <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (The Lord and Nurturer) is: The Owner and the One who Controls and the One who Rectifies and the Master; and these Attributes are always with His Self – without any beginning and without any end, even before the existence of those things that He is the Lord and Master of, and even after those things which He is the Lord and Master of, pass away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[22] وكما أنه محيي الموتى بعدما أحيا، استحق هذا الاسم قبل إحيائهم، كذلك استحق اسم الخالق قبل إنشائهم‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[22] And just as He is the One who is ‘The Giver of life to the dead’ after He gives them life, then He deserves this Name even before He gave life to them; and likewise, He deserves the Name ‘The Creator’ before He created and produced them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So just as He, the Perfect has always possessed the Attribute of being the One who gives life to the dead, and that He gives life and gives death, and this Attribute was never absent (from Him) until He actually gave life to the dead. Rather, it was always His and it always will be His forever.  And as for the action of giving life to the dead, then this is something which occurs newly and repeatedly; Allaah gave life to some and He gives life to some, He the Perfect, whenever He Wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[23] ذلك بأنه على كل شيء قدير‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[23] That is because He has full Power and Ability over everything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an eternal Attribute.  It cannot be said that He did not acquire the Attribute of Power and Ability until He created and produced the creation.  Rather, <em>Al-Qudrah</em> (Power and Ability) is an eternal Attribute of His.  Rather, His having produced the creation, this is an effect produced by His being the One who has full Power and Ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the One who described Himself as being the One who has full Power and Ability over everything – over the things that exist and over the things that do not exist.  And He did not restrict His Power to anything in particular.  Rather, nothing renders Him incapable and it is not permissible to restrict and say that He only has Power over such and such.  And it is not to be said, “Allaah has power over whatever He Wishes.”[3] Because, this saying is particular and restricted to gathering the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all the creatures that He spread throughout them.  And He has full Power to gather them when He Wishes.</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a particular case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [23][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Point [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Listen @ the Link : <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/04/24/he-is-the-ancient-one-without-any-beginning-the-one-who-persists-without-any-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://wp.me/p1VJ3-bCO</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Saheeh Muslim where the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, addressing Allaah in a <em>du`aa</em>., <strong><em>“You are the Last One, so there is nothing after You.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This came previously under Point [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s side point: As a correction of this point, Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>then he criticised this saying here, the saying that you can’t say about Allaah that He has power over what He wishes. Sh al-Albaanee criticised that in his Silsilah &#8230; [break in recording] <strong>“&#8230; <em>Lord of the Creation.  So Allaah will reply, “I am not mocking you but rather I have full ability over whatever I Wish.”</em> ” </strong><em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim in the book of <em>Eemaan</em>. [187].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After he brought this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said: So the saying of Allaah the Most High, at the end of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, <strong><em>“But rather I have full power over whatever I Wish,”</em></strong> this shows the mistake of the one who wrote notes to Al-`Aqeedah A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah quoting some noble person that, “some people say, ‘Allaah has full power over whatever He Wishes’ and that this saying is not correct.”  I (Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee )say: Rather, it is exactly what is correct after its being established in this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, especially when it is witnessed to by the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them when He Wishes.</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not deny that His Wish and His Power and Ability, He the Most High, are general to everything as someone seems to have thought; and Allaah knows best.  [as-Saheehah 6/195, <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>#2601]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[118]    </strong><strong>وهُوَ مُسْتَغْنٍ عَنِ العرشِ وما دُونَه.‏‏‏‏</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[118]       And He (Allaah) has no need of the Throne and whatever is beneath it.</strong></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [118]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not imagine that the meaning of His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em><span style="color:#339966;"> And then He (Allaah) ascended upon the Throne</span> </em></span> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…is that He has need of the Throne just as someone from the creation would mount something from the creation. Rather, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic ascended upon the Throne and He has no need of the Throne, nor of whatever is beneath the Throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the created beings are in total need of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah holds the heavens and the earth so that they do not fall away from their places; and if they moved away, then none besides Him could hold them. </em></span>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) holds and supports the Throne and He holds and supports the heavens and He holds and supports the earth and all the created beings by His Power and His Might. So, they are in need of Him and He has no need of them, He the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fact that something is above something else does not necessitate that the thing which is higher has need of the thing which is beneath. So the heavens are above the earth, and they are not in need of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [118][1] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> From <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he said in his small notes,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz) <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaahu ta`aalaa</em> said, ‘The <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> (A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawee) <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> mentioned this speech here having already mentioned the `<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool); so then afterwards he mentions that He, the Perfect, has no need of the Throne and whatever is beneath the Throne, to make clear that His creating the Throne to ascend over it is not because He had any need of it; rather, for a great wisdom which was necessitated. And the fact that something above is above the thing which is beneath, does not necessitate that the lower thing contains or encompasses or carries the higher thing; nor does it mean that that thing which is higher is in need of that which is lower. So look at the heaven how it is above the earth and yet it is not in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Lord, the Most High is far greater and more tremendous than His ‘Highness’ should necessitate this. Rather, Allaah’s being High (His ‘Highness’) results in qualities particular to Him and in His bearing and carrying whatever is beneath, by His Power. And it necessitates the total need of the lower things for Him and the fact that He, the Perfect, has no need whatsoever of what is beneath Him. And it necessitates His encompassing everything, He the Mighty and Majestic. So He is above the Throne and He, by His Power, supports the Throne and its carriers and He has no need of the Throne. And the Throne is in need of Him and He encompasses the Throne and the Throne does not encompass Him; and He confines the Throne and it does not confine Him; and all of these things are not possible for the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those people who deny <em>al-`uluww</em> (Allaah’s Highness) – the people who deny His Attributes, if they only accepted this detailed explanation, then they would be guided to the correct path, and they would know that intellect is in accordance with the texts and they would be proceeding behind the proof. However, they depart from the proof so they go astray from the correct way. And the affair in that regard is just as Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said when he was asked about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then He (Allaah) ascended over the Throne</span> </em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…and other things, (someone asked him), “How did He ascend?’ So Imaam Maalik replied, “<em>Istiwaa</em> (ascending) is known and how is unknown.”’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> Likewise, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah in Dar· at-Ta`aaru<u>d</u> al-`Aql wan-Naql (درء تعارض العقل والنقل) makes the same point – that it is from Allaah’s tremendous Power that He supports the Throne and whoever is carrying the Throne, and they only support the Throne because of power given to them by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [13]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the One who created the creation and He has no need of them.  Rather, He created them just so that they should worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat (51), <em>aayah</em> 56)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He created them not because He had any need of them – that they should aid Him or assist Him or help Him, He the One free from all imperfections, or that they should defend Him.  He only created them so that they should worship Him.  And they (the people) are the ones who need that worship in order to connect themselves to Allaah and to attach themselves to their Lord.  So `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is the connection between the person and his Lord.  So it draws him closer to Allaah, and through it he attains reward from Allaah, and recompense.  So, `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is a need of the creation and it is not a need of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), you and everybody upon the earth, then Allaah is the Independent One who has no need, the One deserving of all praise. </em></span>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), then Allaah has no need of you. </span></em>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (the author’s) saying, <strong>“Allaah is the Provider without any difficulty”</strong>[2] meaning, He is the One who provides all the provision for His servants and that does not diminish what He has with Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]  And there is nothing like Him. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F321258104&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [3]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is taken from the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>There is nothing like Him (Allaah)</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And there is none equal or comparable to Him (Allaah) </em></span>(Sooratul-I<u>kh</u>laa<u>s</u> (112), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>So do not set up any rivals for Allaah</em></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: those who are alike or similar to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of any namesake for Him (Allaah)?</span> </em>[1] (Soorah Maryam (19), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: anyone like Him – one who can share His Name, He the Perfect and Most High. So <em>at-tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (التمثيل &#8211; there being anyone like Him) and <em>at-ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (التشبيه &#8211; there being anyone resembling Him), both of these are negated for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no one from His creation resembles Him. So this is what is obligatory – that we affirm whatever Allaah has affirmed for Himself and we hold that as our creed. However, we do not hold that He resembles anyone from His creation nor do we hold that He is like his creation, He, the Perfect and Most High. So this contains a refutation of the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> &#8211; who believe that Allaah is like His creation and (they) do not differentiate between the Creator and the creation; and this is a false and futile position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And opposite to this position, is the position of the <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (المعطلة &#8211; those who negate/deny Allaah’s attributes) – those who go beyond limits in declaring Allaah free to such an extent that they deny for Allaah that which He has affirmed for Himself with regards to Names and Attributes. Doing so, as they claim, to flee away from declaring Him to be like His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, both of these two groups go beyond the limits. The <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (those who deny His attributes) go beyond limits in <em>tanzeeh</em> (تنزيه &#8211; declaring Him free) and denying any likeness. Whereas, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> (المشبهة &#8211; those who declare Allaah’s Attributes to be like those of the creation) go beyond the limit in affirmation. Whereas, the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> take the moderate and middle position. So, they affirm for Allaah whatever He affirms for Himself in accordance with what befits His Majesty, without <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (declaring His attributes to be like the attributes of the creation) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل &#8211; denying His attributes), doing so in accordance with the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, “<strong>There is nothing like Him</strong>” negates and denies any <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (resemblance with the creation) and His saying, “<strong>And He (Allaah) is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</strong>” is a negation of <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (denying His attributes). So this is the position which the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> proceed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, it is said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْمُعَطِّلُ يَعْبُدُ عَدَمًا، وَالْمُشَبِّهُ يَعْبُدُ صَنَمًا، وَالْمُوَحِّدُ يَعْبُدُ إِلَـٰهًا وَاحِدًا فَرْدًا صَمَدًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>il</em> (one who negates Allaah’s attributes) worships something which does not exist;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbih</em> (one who declares Allaah’s attributes to be like those of the creation) worships an idol;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (person upon true <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) worships the sole One who deserves worship, the One who is Single, the Independent Lord and Master.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [3][3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Naa<u>s</u>ir As-Sa`dee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in the <em>tafseer</em> of this <em>aayah</em> that the <em>aayah</em> is in the form of a question and what is meant is a denial i.e. there is no namesake for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says regarding this point: “<strong>And there is nothing like Him</strong>”: This is one of the fundamentals from the fundamental principles of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed;</em> which is, that with regard to Allaah the Most High: <strong>there is nothing like Him</strong> – neither in His Self, His Attributes and His Actions. However, the innovators and the people of <em>ta.weel</em> (تأويل &#8211; those who twist Allaah’s Attributes) take it as a principle by which they deny many of Allaah’s Attributes, He, the Exalted and Most High. So whenever their hearts are too constricted to believe in one of His Attributes, He, the Mighty and Majestic, then they perform <em>ta.weel</em> (twist that Attribute) and try and destroy it and deny it. So they deny an Attribute and they use as an evidence for what they are doing His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him …</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pretending to be ignorant of the end of the <em>aayah:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">… and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> gathers between declaring Him free, along with affirming His Attributes. So whoever wishes to be safe and sound in his creed then he should declare Allaah, the Most High, to be free from any resemblance to the creation, without explaining His Attributes away, and without denying His Attributes. Rather, he should affirm for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to Attributes, everything which He has affirmed for Himself in His Book or in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of His Prophet, without declaring that the Creator resembles the creation. This is the position of the <em>Salaf;</em> and the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, was upon it following on from Abu <u>H</u>aneefah and the rest of <em>imaams</em>.

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [11]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Life is a complete and perfect life which does not suffer from any deficiency nor any sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him, the Ever-Living One, the Independent Sustainer of all.  Neither sleep nor slumber takes hold of Him.</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And place reliance upon the Ever-Living One Who does not die.</span></em> (Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>58)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negates for Himself <em>as-sinah</em> (السِنة – slumber) and that means light sleep and (He negates for Himself) <em>an-nawm</em> (النوم) which is deep sleep.[1] And He negated for Himself <em>al-mawt</em> (الموت – death) because of the completeness and perfection of His Life, He the Perfect and Most High.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sleep and slumber and death, these are deficiencies in life and these are attributes to be found in the creation; and the life of the creation is deficient because he sleeps and he dies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sleeping is a part of completeness with regard to the creation but it is a deficiency with regard to the Creator; because a person who cannot sleep they have an affliction affecting their health.  So this shows the difference and the distinction between the Attributes of the Creator and the attributes of the creation.  And as for the two Names: الحي (<em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em> &#8211; The Ever-living) and القيوم (<em>Al-Qayyoom</em> –and the independent Sustainer of all), then these are two attributes taken from the statement of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him, He is the Ever-living, the independent Sustainer of all </span></em>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em>, the Ever-living means the One who has complete and perfect life and <em>Al-Qayyoom</em> is a word in intensive form.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> stood amongst us with five sayings; so he said, <strong><em>“Allaah the Mighty and Majestic does not sleep and it is not befitting for Him that He should sleep&#8230;”</em></strong> the hadeeth.  Reported by Muslim in the book of <em>Eemaan.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[85] And the covenant (<em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em>) which Allaah, the Most High, took from Aadam and his descendants, is true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F320973191&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [85]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> (ميثاق – covenant) which Allaah, the Most High, took from Aadam and his descendants, that they would worship Him and not associate anything in worship along with Him, this is true. Just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us, that Allaah extracted the descendants of Aadam from his back, and they were like tiny red ants, and He caused them to bear witness upon themselves to His Unity. And He took their <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> (covenant) that they would worship Him, and not associate anything in worship along with Him.[1] So we have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in this. However, this agreement and covenant is not sufficient (in itself). Rather, it was essential along with it, to send the Messengers. So therefore, Allaah sent the Messengers. And if this had been sufficient alone, then Allaah would not have sent the Messengers. However, He sent the Messengers in order to remind by means of them, and to call the people to what is contained in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for His saying, He, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <em><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when your Lord took out from the descendants of Aadam, their offspring.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of <em>Tafseer</em> (explainers of the Qur·aan), they hold that this refers to the agreement and the covenant which Allaah took from the descendants of Aadam; but that is not the case. Rather, it is something else. And Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“From their backs”</strong> and He did not say, “…from the back of Aadam”. And the completion of the <em>aayah</em> is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He caused them to witness upon themselves, “Am I not your Lord?” So they said, “Yes indeed!”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of the scholars say the meaning of this is: the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> (الفطرة – the inborn nature) which Allaah created them upon, and the signs within the creation which Allaah set up; so that from them, they should know and be aware of their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect, created them upon the nature of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and upon Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And set your face straight upon the Religion, turning away from <u>sh</u>irk, which is the inborn way upon which Allaah created all of the people.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that (natural inborn way upon which Allaah created the people) is the religion of Islaam and the religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed. </em>So, Islaam means: the <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> which the Messengers came with. And that means: worshipping Allaah alone, and associating no partner with Him; and that is the straight and true Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, along with this, He set up evidences proving His Lordship, from that which they witness in themselves with regard to the amazing way in which they have been created and in the amazing signs which are a proof for the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High. And likewise, He set up for them, in front of them, in the heavens and the earth and in the created beings, that which is a proof for the Creator. For indeed these created things must have a Creator; they could not have just appeared or come about without a Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Is it that they were created by nothing, or are they the ones who created? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? No, they do not have certainty.</span></em> (Sooratu<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>oor (52), <em>aayaat </em>35-36)[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                فيا عجبًا كيف يعصى الإله             أم كيف يجحده الجاحد</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                وفي كل شيء له آيـــة                     تدل على أنه واحـــد</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So how amazing – how can the One deserving of all worship be disobeyed</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                                    Or how can the obstinate denier deny Him</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">                        When every single thing contains an evidence for Him</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Proving that He is One!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything in front of you proves the Unity of Allaah and bears witness that He is alone in having created all these created things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those things which you call upon besides Allaah could never create a fly, even if they gathered together to do it.</span></em> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Creator is Allaah, the Perfect. No one creates along with Him. So therefore, how can something else besides Him be worshipped, from those things which do not create and do not provide provision, and do not possess the ability to bring benefit for themselves nor harm?! So the meaning of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ‘witnessing’ of this <em>aayah</em> refers to the witness of the correct inborn nature, and the witness of the created beings to the Unity of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there is no possibility for anyone to have an excuse on the Day of Resurrection, and therefore say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>We were unaware of this</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>172)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, using blind-following of others is not correct in the face of decisive proofs and clear evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [85][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa,</em> from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Allaah took the covenant (mee<u>th</u>aaq) from the back of Aadam `alayhis-salaam at Na`maan – meaning `Arafah – so He took out from his backbone every one of his descendants whom He was going to produce, and spread them out in front of Him, then He spoke to them and said, ‘Am I not your Lord?’ So they said, ‘Yes, indeed we bear witness…’ the aayaat until ‘…those who call upon other than Allaah’.”</em></strong> (Sooratul-`Araaf (7), 172-173).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-<u>H</u>aakim and he declared it authentic, and A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>ahabee agreed and Al-Hay<u>th</u>amee said, “Its narrators are those of the <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>” and its chain of narration was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> A<u>h</u>mad <u>Sh</u>aakir in his checking of the Musnad, and the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah, no. 1623.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, who said, “The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no child who is born except that he is born upon the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> (natural way of Islaam). And then his parents turn him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian. It is just like when an animal gives birth to a baby animal &#8211; do you find it mutilated?’” Then Aboo Hurayrah recited the <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>The natural way upon which Allaah created the people. </em></span><strong><br />
</strong>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1358.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: Regarding these <em>aayaat</em>, the great <em>Mufassir</em>, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Naa<u>s</u>ir As-Sa`dee, points out the way in which these <em>aayaat</em> are an evidence (in his <em>Tafseer</em>) and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence upon them, using an affair which does not enable them (those who deny Allaah) to do anything except to submit to the truth, or to depart from what is necessitated by the intellect and the Religion. An explanation of that is to say that those people who deny Allaah’s sole right to worship, and who deny His Messenger, that this necessitates their denying that Allaah created them. And it is confirmed in the intellect, along with the Legislation, that the affair cannot escape one of three affairs: either they were created by nothing, meaning that they have no Creator who created them; rather, they came about not having been brought into existence, and having nothing that brought them into existence; this is something impossible. Or, they are the creators of themselves, and this is also impossible because it cannot be imagined that something has produced itself. So, when these two affairs are nullified and are clearly impossible, then the third matter becomes certain &#8211; that it is Allaah who created them. And when that becomes certain, then it becomes known that Allaah, the Most High, He is therefore, the One alone who deserves to be worshipped and that He is the One for whom worship is right and befitting, and it is not right or befitting for anyone besides Him, He the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> takes the view of those who explain the <em>aayah</em> (<strong>And He caused them to witness upon themselves, “Am I not your Lord?” So they said, “Yes indeed!”</strong> – Al-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 172) to refer to the inborn nature that Allaah has placed in the people, and that it doesn’t refer to the taking out of the souls of the descendants of Aadam from him and their being verbally asked to bear witness. As he indicated, there are some people who held that (view). In that regard, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> was one of those who held the other view – that the <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf and the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and this <em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em> is one and the same thing. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee refutes those who disagree with that, and you will find it in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah, Volume 4, pages 161-162 thereabouts, under <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1623. Part of what he mentions, is that he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Anbaaree said, “The position of the people of <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and the major ones from the people of knowledge, hold that this <em>aayah</em> means that Allaah took out the descendants of Aadam from his back and then from the backs of his descendants. And they were in the form of little ants and then He took from them the covenant (<em>mee<u>th</u>aaq</em>) that He is their Creator and that they are created beings. So they bore witness to that and accepted it, and this was after intellect had been given to them which enabled them to understand what was presented to them – just as happened to the mountain when it was addressed – intellect was given to it, and the camel when it prostrated, and the palm tree when it was heard.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he (Ibn Al-Anbaaree) quoted from Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahawayh, that he said, “The people of knowledge agreed that Allaah created the souls before the bodies and that He caused them to speak and bear witness.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee goes on to explain that there is no contradiction between this <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf and between the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa, </em>and there is no reason that we should take it to be anything except what is apparent from it – that it refers to Allaah extracting the descendants of Aadam from his back and causing them to bear witness to this covenant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, there is also mention by Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee in Ma`aarij Al-Qabool (معارج القبول). He mentioned the same thing as well – that there is no contradiction between these two. And Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee mentioned that the covenants are actually three (3) covenants. The first covenant is when the people were taken from the back of Aadam and they bore witness to His Unity, and to the fact that none has the right to be worshipped besides Him. Then the second covenant that he mentions, is the <em>fi<u>t</u>rah</em> – as was referred to in the <em>aayah</em> from Sooratur-Room. And the third covenant is what the Messengers came with – that Allaah sent the Messengers ordering the people and commanding the people to worship Allaah alone; and that third one is what establishes Allaah’s proof upon the creation. Then Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Al-<u>H</u>akamee said, “So there is no contraction between any of these; rather, they are all confirmed by the Book and the Sunnah.” And he mentioned, “And as for the saying that this <em>aayah</em> from Sooratul-A`raaf refers to the covenant, and that the descendants of Aadam were taken from his back and bore witness, then that was the saying of the great majority of the people of <em>Tafseer</em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahumullaah</em>).” Wallaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F320515358&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Explanation – Point [12]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So the word) <strong>القيوم (<em>Al-Qayyoom</em></strong> – The Independent Sustainer of everything) is: the One who independently exists by Himself and the One who sustains everything; the One who independently exists and has no need of anything; the One who is independent of everything and the One who sustains everything else.  Everything else is in a state of poverty and need of Him and needs to be sustained by Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  So if it were not that Allaah sustains the heavens and the earth and all of the creation then they would all be destroyed and pass away.  But however, Allaah sustains them and guards them and provides for them – giving them whatever would benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the whole of the creation is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Indeed Allaah holds the heavens and the earth so that they do not move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is no one that could hold them after Him.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> End of explanation of point [12][1]  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong> From the explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he says with regards to these two Names &#8211; <strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em></strong> (that Allaah is Ever-living) and <strong><em>Al-Qayyoom</em></strong> (that Allaah is the Independent One who sustains everything):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two Names, all of the rest of Allaah’s Perfect Names return back and pivot around these two.  And all the meanings of the other Names refer back to these two.  Because the first, <strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>ayaat</em></strong> – the attribute of life, it necessitates for Him all the attributes of perfection; so no attribute will be missing from His attribute of life except due to weakness in that life.  So since the Life of Allaah, the Most High, is the most perfect and complete life, then affirming it means affirmation of every attribute of perfection for Him.  As for the name <em><strong>Al-Qayyoom</strong>,</em> then this includes the perfection of Allaah’s Independence and the perfection of His Power since He is the One who independently exists and has no need of anyone else in any sense; and He is the one Who supports and sustains everything else; and there is no establishment for anything except if He establishes it.  So these two Names gather completely the rest of the Names.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58] (continued from Lesson 16)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) except the people of innovation such as the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> – those who negate the <em>ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen by the believers). They say: This (affirming seeing Allaah) would necessitate that Allaah is in a direction (جهة &#8211; <em>jihah</em>). And it is their view that Allaah is not in a direction; and in their view He is not within the creation, nor is He outside it, nor is He above, nor is He below, nor is He to the right, nor is He to the justify; He is not in any direction. And the meaning of this is that He does not exist, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  So, they deny seeing Allaah because of this futile opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>A<u>sh</u>aa`irah</em>, when they were not able to deny the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah then they affirmed seeing Allaah, but they said: He will be seen, but not in any direction. And this is an amazing contradiction! Because, there is nothing that is seen which is not in a direction; and therefore the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> refuted them for this because it is something impossible. Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> (the people of the Sunnah), they say: He the Perfect and Most High will be seen and He is in the direction of <em>al-`uloo</em> (العلو – being elevated) and above them. Because the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (الجهة – direction), if what is meant by it is a direction within the creation, then in that sense Allaah is not in any such direction because Allaah is not incarnate within His creation, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if what is meant by it, is that He is Exalted and above all of the creation then this is something confirmed for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, Allaah is indeed Exalted and High above the heavens. So the term ‘<em>al-jihah</em>’ (direction) is neither affirmed nor denied directly in text. However, it can be spoken of with the previous details.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <strong>“…without their encompassing Him and without saying how”</strong>: They cannot encompass Allaah the Mighty and Majestic; they will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. And Allaah is <em>A<u>z</u>eem</em> (عظيم – Tremendous); it is not possible that He can be encompassed. He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And they do not encompass Him in Knowledge</em></span> (Soorah <u>T</u>aaHaa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot grasp Him</span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: sight cannot encompass Him; it doesn’t mean that He cannot be seen, because Allaah the Perfect and Most High did not say, “Sight will not see Him (لا تراه الأبصار).” Rather, He said, “<strong>Sight will not grasp Him</strong>.” So, reaching and grasping is something and <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (seeing) is something else. So sight will see Him, He the Perfect, but not encompass Him. So this contains a refutation of those who seek to use this <em>aayah</em> as a proof to deny <em>ar-ru.yah</em> (that Allaah will be seen) – those who say that seeing Allaah is not possible, saying: because Allaah said, “<strong>Sight will not encompass Him.</strong>” So we say to them: You do not know the meaning of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight </span></em> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>aayah,</em> “<strong>Sight does not encompass Him; rather, He encompasses all Sight,</strong>” its meaning is: He will not be encompassed by that. It doesn’t mean that He won’t be seen; and He the Perfect did not say: “Sight will not see Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they also use as evidence, saying: Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Lord, show me Yourself, let me look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me.”</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They say) this is a proof negating <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say to them: This refers to this world because Moosaa asked for that in this world and no one will see Allaah in this world – neither any Prophet nor anyone else. But as for in the Hereafter, then the believers will certainly see their Lord. And the conditions in the world are not the same as the conditions in the Hereafter. So the people in this world are weak in their bodies and weak in their senses; they are not able to see Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. But as for in the Hereafter, then Allaah will give them the ability by which they will be able to see their Lord, the Majestic and Most High, (He would give this) as an honour for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, when Moosaa asked his Lord in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He said, “You will not see Me; however, look at the mountain and if it remains in its place then you shall see Me.” So when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He caused it to shatter to dust. </span></em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountain shattered and turned to dust; and the mountain is inanimate and solid, so how about the created being who is composed of flesh and blood and bones? He is not able to see Allaah in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this question that Moosaa asked, to see Allaah, is a proof that it is permissible to see Him and possible (to see Him); because Moosaa would not ask his Lord for anything which is not permissible. Rather, he asked Him for something which is permissible; but, it would not occur in this world. So therefore, Allaah the Perfect said, “<strong>You will not see Me,</strong>” and He did not say “I cannot be seen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed be seen in the Hereafter,[2] and those who have the most right to this seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) are the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And we do not say how this will be</strong>” meaning: it is not to be said, “How will they see Allaah?” because this is just like the rest of the Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – we do not know how they are. So, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them (we believe in them) and we know their meaning and we affirm them. However, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (كيفية– how they are) is unknown; we do not know it. So Allaah knows better about that, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> End of explanation of point [58] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[59]     Just as is stated by the Book of our Lord: “On that Day some faces will be radiant, shining, looking at their Lord.” (Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75) <em>aayaat</em> 22-3).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clearly states that it is looking upon Allaah with sight since the term for ‘looking’ is used with <em>ilaa</em> (إلى – the particle ‘towards’). So its meaning is ‘looking with sight’. Whereas the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say: ﭽ ﭝ  ﭞﭼ <em>‘ilaa’</em> (إلى) here is a plural and it means ‘blessings’; so (they say) it means: ‘they will be looking at the Blessings of their Lord’ and this is foolish delusion which people of intellect would laugh at since a particle doesn’t become plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60] وتَفْسيرُهُ عَلى ما أرادَهُ اللهُ تَعالَى وَعَلِمَه‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[60]     And its explanation is as Allaah the Most High, wanted and knew.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the explanation of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking upon their Lord </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (its explanation) is just as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic wanted, and that is that it means ‘seeing with sight’. Its explanation is not as the innovators want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61] وكلُّ ما جاءَ في ذَلِكَ مِنَ الحديثِ الصَّحيحِ عَنِ الرسولِ صلَّى الله عليه وآله وسلَّم فهو كما قال‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[61]     And every authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported from the Messenger, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em> (may Allaah extol him and his true followers and grant him perfect peace and security), then it is just as he said.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: everything reported from the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> affirming that Allaah will be seen, then it is true upon its reality – just the same as what occurs in the Qur.aan. It is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> in it because it is the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>which is <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he (the Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) does not speak from his own desires; it is just revelation inspired. </span></em>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it (the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is called ‘the second Revelation’. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed in many <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people) that the believers would see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in that, without <em>ta<u>h</u>reef </em>(تحريف – altering the meaning) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل – negating) and without <em>tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (تمثيل<em> – </em>likening Him to His creation) and without <em>takyeef</em> (تكييف<em> – </em>saying ‘how’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62] وَمَعناهُ على ما أرادَ‏‏‏‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[62]     And its meaning is as He intended.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: as the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended (when he said it), not as those innovators and deviants intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [62][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In Shaykh Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen’s abridgement of Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah, Talqees Al-<u>H</u>amawiyyah (تلخيص الحموية) of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, he mentioned a point right near the beginning, which was: that the people of the Sunnah in affirming Allaah’s Attributes, (first principle:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we affirm for Allaah whatever He affirmed for Himself or whatever His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> affirmed for Him, (second principle:) and we deny/negate for Allaah whatever He negated for Himself or the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>negated for Him. Thirdly, where there is something that is not denied in text, nor is it affirmed in text, from those things which the people disagree about, such as the term ‘a body’ (جسم – <em>j</em><em>ism</em>) or ‘<em>al-<u>h</u>eez</em>’ (being in a place) and ‘<em>al-jihah’</em> (being in a direction) and the like of that, then their way (the people of the Sunnah) is <em>at-tawaqquf</em> – to stop and withhold with regard to its wording. So they don’t affirm its wording and they don’t deny it since it is not reported. And as for its meaning, then we ask for the detail of what is meant by it, and if we find that what is meant by it is something futile and false – something which Allaah is declared free of, then we reject it; and if what is meant by it is something true – something which is not prohibited for Allaah, then we accept it. This is their way and this is the obligatory way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on in the book (page 45) he actually goes into detail about <em>al-jihah. </em>He mentioned that the later people brought this term up (<em>al-jihah</em> – direction) and he deals with it in this way i.e. if what they mean is a direction within the creation then we deny that for Allaah and if what they mean by that is that Allaah is above the heavens, then we affirm that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] On the authority of Aboo Moosaa Al-A<u>sh</u>`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْنٍ‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><em>“There will be two gardens containing silver – their utensils and whatever they contain, and two gardens of gold &#8211; their utensils and whatever they contain, and nothing will be between the people in the eternal garden and their looking upon their Lord, except the cloak of rightful pride upon His Face.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in the Book of <em>Tafseer</em>, <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 4878 and 4880 and reported by Muslim in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made a fairly small point on this point here. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know that the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported affirming the believers seeing their Lord on the Day of Resurrection are very many – to the extent that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> as has been clearly stated by a group of the <em>imaams</em>. From them, the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz), and he mentioned some of them and then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about the <em>ru.yah</em> (seeing Allaah) are reported by around thirty companions and whoever acquired comprehensive knowledge of them will state with certainty that the Messenger (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) definitely said it and if I had not put it upon myself to write this book in abridged form, then I would quote more of the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> </em>here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, “The declaration that seeing Allaah the Most High will be like seeing the Sun and the Moon is not <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (تشبيه) of Allaah (causing Allaah to resemble His creation). Rather, it is a statement that the ‘act’ of seeing is like ‘that’ act of seeing – not that the One seen is like the thing which is seen. However, it does contain an evidence that Allaah is above His creation; since, can any seeing be comprehended without facing? And as for those people who say, ‘He will be seen, but not in a direction,’ then this person should look back and check his own intellect because either he is opposing obstinately his correct intellect or his intellect has got something wrong with it. Or otherwise a person saying, ‘He will be seen but He will not be in front, He will not be behind, He will not be to the right, He will not be to the justify, He will not be above and He will not be below;’ (then this is not correct) anyone who hears this, whose nature is sound, then he will reject it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: And as for His, He the Most High, being seen in this world, then the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said in the authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that none of us will see Him until he dies. <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim. And as for him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then there is nothing reported to affirm that he even saw his Lord. Indeed, there is something authentic from him which indicates a denial of this because when he was asked about this he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">نور، أنى أراه</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Meaning:  <span style="color:#339966;"> “Light, how could I see Him”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And along with this, the noble lady `Aa.ishah (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>) clearly denied this (that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw his Lord) as occurs in the two <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>’s; and that is the basic principle which we cling to.”</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">At-Ta`leeqaat Al-Mu<u>kh</u>ta<u>s</u>arah `alaa Matn Al-`Aqeedah A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah</span><br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319877140&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58][1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (الرؤية – the seeing) means: the believers seeing their Lord, the Perfect and Most High; because the believers will see their Lord, the Perfect and Most High, in the Hereafter. They will see Him openly – with their eyes, just as they see the moon on the night when it is full and just as they see the sun bright and clear when there is no cloud-cover to hide it; just as the chosen Prophet (Al-Mu<u>st</u>afaa) <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about in the authentic <em>mutawaatir</em> <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> from him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.[2] So therefore, the author said, “The seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) is true” meaning: it is affirmed by the Book and the Sunnah and the <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus) of the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> from the <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) and from the <em><u>Kh</u>alaf</em> (later peoples). Nobody disagrees about that except for the <em>mubtadi`ah</em> (innovators) and the people of the deviant ways.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believers will see their Lord, the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) some faces would be radiant, looking at their Lord.<br />
</span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the faces of the believers. As for (the word in the first <em>aayah</em>) <em>‘naa<u>d</u>irah’</em> (ناضرة &#8211; radiant), meaning: from <em>an-na<u>d</u>rah</em> (النضرة) which means brilliance and beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize upon their faces the radiance of bliss.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for (the second <em>aayah</em>) <em>‘na<u>z</u>irah’</em> (ناظرة) then it means looking with the eyes. You say: <em>“na<u>z</u>artu ilaa ka<u>dh</u>aa”</em> (نظرت إلى كذا) – “I looked upon such and such” when you mean: “I saw it” (أبصرته) – <em>ab<u>s</u>artuh</em>. The term <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) has different usages in the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. (Firstly), if it is used with the term ‘<em>ilaa’ </em>(إلى) meaning ‘towards’ or ‘to’ then it means: seeing with the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not look upon the camels at how they have been created and at the sky and how it has been raised?</span></em>  (Sooratul-<u>Gh</u>aa<u>sh</u>iyah (88), <em>aayaat </em>17-18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Will they not look with their eyes at these amazing parts of the creation which prove the Power and Ability of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking at their Lord</span> </em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Using the term ‘<em>ilaa’</em> (إلى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) is used on its own without any intermediate particle, then it means: halting and waiting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the male and female hypocrites will say to those who believe, “Wait for us so that we can acquire some of your light.”</span></em> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Wait for us so we can derive some light from your light; because the hypocrites, their lights will be extinguished, and Allaah’s Refuge is sought; so they will remain in darkness. So therefore, they will seek from the believers to wait for them until they can take some light from their light. And His Saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah should come to them?</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: They do not await except the coming of the Lord on the Day of Resurrection, to carry out judgment between His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) – ‘looking’ is used with the particle ‘<em>fee’</em> (في) – ‘into’, then it carries the meaning of ‘reflecting and considering’, just as Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not reflect upon the Dominion of the heavens and the earth.</span></em> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: reflect upon those things created by Allaah in the heavens and upon the earth and take this as a proof for the Power and Ability of Allaah, the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High; and of His being deserving of all worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) here is used with the particle ‘<em>ilaa’</em> (إلى) – ‘at’ and its meaning is: (‘looking at’) seeing and seeing with the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the finest reward and an increase.</span> </em>(Soorah Yoonus (10), <em>aayah </em>26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself, explained the term <em>‘al-<u>h</u>usnaa’</em> (الحسنى – the finest) to mean Paradise; and he explained <em>‘az-ziyaadah’</em> (الزيادة – the increase) to mean looking at the Honorable Face of Allaah. And this occurs in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those who are dutiful to Allaah will have whatever they wished in Paradise and we have something extra for them.</span></em> (Soorah Qaaf (50), <em>aayah </em>35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Al-mazeed</em>’ (المزيد – something extra): it is looking at the Honorable Face of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said about the unbelievers,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">But no! On that Day the unbelievers will be blocked and screened away from their Lord.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the unbelievers are screened away from Allaah, not seeing Him because they disbelieved in this world, so then they will be screened and prevented from looking upon Him on the Day of Resurrection. And this is the greatest deprivation and the greatest punishment; and Allaah’s Refuge is sought. So the <em>aayah</em> proves that the believers would not be blocked and screened away from Allaah on the Day of Resurrection and that they will indeed look upon Him in the Hereafter; because they believed in Him in this world, not having seen Him. Rather, they took as proof for Him, He the Perfect, His Signs and His Messages (sent to His Messengers). So therefore, Allaah will honour them with looking upon Him on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And looking upon the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, is the greatest bliss in Paradise. This is the position of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> and these are some of their proofs from the Qur.aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their proofs from the Sunnah then they are very many; indeed they reach the level of <em>mutwaatir</em> (being reported by a very large number of people at every stage of transmission – from the Companions, <em>Taabi`een</em> and every level thereon), as was said by the great scholar Ibnul-Qayyim in his valuable book <em><u>H</u>aadiyul-Arwaa<u>h</u> ilaa Bilaadil-Afraa<u>h</u></em> (حادي الأرواح إلى بلاد الأفراح) and he quoted the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported about seeing Allaah (by the believers on the Day of Resurrection) and that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إنكم سترون ربكم يوم القيامة، كما ترون القمر ليلة البدر، وكما ترون الشمس صحوًا ليس دونـها سحاب، لا تُضامون في رؤيته – أو:‏ لا تَضامُّون في رؤيته</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008080;">“You will certainly see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection, just as you see the Moon on the night when it is full and just as you see the Sun – bright and clear, not being covered over by clouds; and you will not be put to trouble in seeing Him – or you will not have to rush and crowd together to see Him.”</span></em> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You will not have to scramble and crowd to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because every single one will see the Lord, each person remaining at his place without any crowding or scrambling, just as the people see the Sun and the Moon without having to scramble and crowd. Usually if there is something upon the earth which is hidden, then the people have to scramble to get to see it. However, if it is something raised up like the Sun and the Moon, then they do not have to crowd and scramble to see it; everyone can see it while he still remains at his place. And if this is the case with regard to something created, the Sun and the Moon, then how about the Creator, the Perfect and Most High?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point [58] to be continued <em>inshaa. Allaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In the larger explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz, Ibn Abil-`Izz said with regard to this point, “This matter is one of the noblest matters from the principles of the religion and from the most tremendous of them. And it is the limit which those people who strive, strive for, and those people who vie, vie for. And those will be deprived, those who are screened away from their Lord; they will be truly deprived – those who are turned away from His Door.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] (One of these <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>) from Jareer ibn `Abdillaah al-Bajalee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كُنَّا عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فَنَظَرَ إِلَى الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَة يَعْنِي الْبَدْرَ فَقَالَ إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ لَا تُضَامُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><em>“We were the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and he looked at the Moon on the night when it was full and he said, ‘You will certainly see your Lord, just as you see this Moon; you will not be put to trouble in seeing Him’.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 554 and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: Some of the explainers make the point that this <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> affirms seeing Allaah truly and really, just as we truly and really see the Moon and the Sun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Abil-`Izz mentions who they are. He said, “The ones who disagree and differ about seeing, they are the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow them from the <em><u>Kh</u>awaarij</em> and the <em>Imaamiyyah</em> (the <em><u>Sh</u>ee`ah</em>). And their saying is false and futile and it is rejected by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Muslim reports it as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 181, in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, and also reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree from a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em><em>,</em> as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>554, 806 and 7434, and also by Muslim who reports it with the wording: تضارون (you will not cause harm to anyone to see Him.)</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45] وأن القرآن كلام الله‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45]    And that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then, you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah; because this is what the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came with, and Allaah sent down the Qur.aan to him.  And this Qur.aan is not from the speech of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor is it from the speech of Jibreel; rather, it is just the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  Allaah spoke with it, and Jibreel took it from Allaah, and the Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> took it from Jibreel <em>`alahis-salaam</em>, and the Ummah (this nation) took it from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the Speech of Allaah; it originated from Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  Jibreel did not take it from <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (اللوح المحفوظ<em> – </em>the Preserved Tablet) as the people of misguidance say.  And it is not from the speech of Jibreel nor Mu<u>h</u>ammad; rather, it is from the Speech of the Lord of the whole of creation.  And as for Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then those two were Messengers who conveyed from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  For speech is said by, and attributed to, the one who initially spoke it; not the one who said it only as one conveying and transmitting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, those who say that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet or who say that Allaah created it within something and then Jibreel took it from that thing, then whoever says this is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, who has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes them out of the Religion, as is the saying of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow their way.  So it (the Qur.aan) is the Speech of Allaah – its letters and its meanings; Allaah spoke with it as He wished.  So, we describe Allaah with the Attribute of His having spoken; and <em>Al-Kalaam</em> (Speech) is from Allaah’s Attributes which are actions (<em><u>s</u>ifaatihil-fi`liyyah</em>).  And the ‘how’ (<em>kayfiyyah</em>) or the manner in which He spoke with it, then in that regard we say, “Allaah knows best about that.” So, this is just like the rest of His Attributes, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them but we do not know how they are.  So the meaning is known but as for ‘how’, then that is unknown to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46] منه بدأ بلا كيفية قولًا، وأنزله على رسوله وحيًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46]    It originated from Him as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.  </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Qur.aan descended from Allaah; Allaah spoke with it and sent it down.  It did not descend from someone else besides Him, and it did not originate from someone other than Him.  It is not as they say, that it originated from Jibreel or from the Preserved Tablet or from somewhere in mid-air.  Rather, it began from Allaah and Jibreel heard it and he conveyed it to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) and the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he conveyed it to the people.  And if this Qur.aan had been from the speech of humans then someone from the people would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it.  So, since they are unable to do this, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if you are in any doubt about that which We sent down to Our slave (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam), then bring a soorah like it and call your witnesses besides Allaah upon that, if you are truthful.  </em></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the One free from all imperfections and the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they say, “He forged it”?  Say, “Then bring ten soorahs which are forged like it.” </span></em>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah rendered them incapable of doing that, even though they were Arabs and eloquent in the language.  And the Qur.aan is in the language of the Arabs and is in the letters which they spoke with, and they were eager to oppose the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> and if it was within their ability to resist and oppose this Qur.aan, they would not have saved any efforts to do so.  So when they were unable to do that, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47] وصدّقه المؤمنون على ذلك حقًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47]    And the believers attest to it as being the Truth upon that basis. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [47]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah and His Messenger, they believe that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was just one who conveyed (the Message) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is the Speech brought by an honourable Messenger (Jibreel `alayhis-salaam) possessing the strength to do whatever duty he is given; high in status with the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. </span></em>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayaat </em>19-20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by its being ascribed to Jibreel, is from the aspect of conveying<em>;</em> since it is not possible that this Qur.aan is from the Speech of Allaah <em>and</em> from the speech of Jibreel.  Speech does not come except from one; so it is not possible to describe it as being the Speech of more than one.  And its being ascribed to Allaah is <em><u>h</u>aqeeqiyyah</em> (true and real) and as for its being ascribed to Jibreel, then (it is) from the aspect of conveying it (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em> &#8211; تبليغ).  And in another <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed it is Speech conveyed by an honourable Messenger and it is not the speech of a poet; little it is that you believe.</span> </em>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayaat </em>40-41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  So its being ascribed to him is an ascription of conveying (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em>).  So He, the One free of all imperfections, sometimes ascribes it to Himself, and sometimes to Jibreel and sometimes to Mu<u>h</u>ammad (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).  And one and the same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.  So therefore, its being ascribed to Allaah is an ascription with regard to its origin and that it is His Speech, and its being ascribed to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad is an ascription of conveying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [47] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> In his larger explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz goes into great detail in explaining these points and if you want to see the beauty of the saying of the people of Truth about the Qur.aan being the Speech of Allaah: that it originated from Him, He spoke with it and its Letters and Meanings are from His Speech; then if you read the explanation and his inclusion of eight (8) sayings of the people of deviation, then you will further see the beauty of this speech.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah and it originated from Him; it is not created.</li>
<li>One who says that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes him out of the religion.</li>
<li>It originated from Allaah as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.</li>
<li>If the Qur.aan was from the speech of humans then someone would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it. But they cannot; so this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah.</li>
<li>Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> were just Messengers who conveyed the Message (Qur.aan) from Allaah.</li>
<li>The same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.</li>
<li>When Allaah mentions: <strong>“…Speech brought by an honorable Messenger” </strong>and<strong> “…Speech conveyed by an honorable Messenger”</strong>, this ascription to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> is an ascription of conveying and not of having originally spoken with the Speech.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 8:   [8] ولا يكون إلا ما يريد‏.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 8: </strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[8]</strong> <strong>ولا يكون إلا ما يريد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[8] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And nothing occurs except what He (Allaah) wills.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319065738&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [8]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains an affirmation of <em>al-Qadr </em>(القدر &#8211; pre-decree) and an affirmation of <em>al-Iraadah</em> (الإرادة &#8211; Allaah’s Will).  So nothing exists within His kingdom and nothing occurs within His creation whether events or things except that Allaah willed it to occur, He the Perfect and Most High – willing it with His <em>Iraadah al-Kawniyyah</em> (Universal Will):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And His Affair, when He wills something, is just that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is!</span></em><br />
(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every good and every evil occurs by Allaah’s Universal Will; so nothing escapes from His Will.  And this contains a refutation of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> – those who deny <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and who claim that the person himself, he is the one who creates his own actions and produces his own actions; and Highly Exalted is Allaah above that which they say.  Because this (saying of theirs) is a declaration of Allaah’s being unable and (it is a statement) that there are things in His creation which He the Perfect and Most High does not Will.  So this is to describe Him with deficiency because everything which occurs within the creation – whether good or evil, then it occurs by His Will.  Rather, He creates good for a wise purpose and He creates that which is evil for a wise purpose.  So from the aspect of its creation, then it is not an evil because it is created for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous goal which is to test and to try, and to distinguish that which is foul from that which is good, and in order to reward the people upon their righteous deeds and to recompense the people for their evil deeds.  And He was Wise in that, He, the Perfect and Most High; He did not create anything without purpose.</p>
<p>End of explanation of point [8][1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his famous explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah, says: “<strong>And nothing exists except what He (Allaah) wills</strong>.” This contains a refutation of the saying of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> because they say, “Allaah willed <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) from all of the people but the unbeliever is the one who willed unbelief for himself.” And this saying of theirs is corrupt and is rejected since it contrary to the Book and the Sunnah and to correct intellect and it is the well-known matter of <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and something in explanation of that will follow <em>inshaa Allaahu ta`aalaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they (these people who deny pre-decree) are called the <em>Qadariyyah</em> because they denied pre-decree; and likewise the <em>Jabariyyah</em> (who say that the people have no free will and are forced to do whatever they do) are also called the people of pre-decree (<em>Qadariyyah</em>).  This name (<em>al-Qadariyyah</em>) is mostly used for the first group (those who deny the pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah, then they say that even though Allaah willed that sins would occur, however, He does not love them and He is not pleased with them and He did not command them.  Rather, He hates them and is angry with them and He forbade them.  This is the saying of all of the <em>Salaf</em> – those who say, “Whatever Allaah willed occurs and whatever He did not will, does not occur.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the verifiers from the people of the Sunnah say, “‘Will’ in the Book of Allaah is of two types: Allaah’s Will referring to His pre-decree (His Universal Will – الإرادة الكونية) and His Legislational Will (الإرادة الشرعية) which comprises His Love and His Pleasure.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>لا يفنى ولا يبيد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He does not perish nor (does He) pass away. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319064019&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-fanaa. </em>(الفناء &#8211; perishing) and <em>al-beed</em> (البيد &#8211; passing away) have one and the same meaning.[1]  So Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High has as His Attribute: continual and everlasting life.  Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And place reliance upon the Ever-Living One Who does not die.</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>58)</p>
<p>So, Allaah never perishes (passes away).  He, the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Everything will perish except for His Face.</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>88)</p>
<p>And He, the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone upon (the earth) will perish (die).  But the Majestic and Noble Face of your Lord will remain forever. </span></em>(Sooratur-Ra<u>h</u>maan (55), <em>aayaat </em>26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for Him, the Perfect and Most High, is <em>Al-Baqaa. </em>(البقاء – persisting and remaining forever) whereas the creation will die and then they will be resurrected.  And initially, they, the creation, were non-existent and then Allaah created them and then they will die and then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will raise them in the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah the One free of all imperfections and the Most High had no beginning and He has no end.</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahawiyyah : Point # 6 </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قديم بلا ابتداء، دائم بلا انتهاء‏.</strong></p>
<p>[6]<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>  He is the Ancient One without any beginning, the One who Persists without any ending.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319057196&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [6]</strong></span></p>
<p>As is indicated by saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) is the First and the Last</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p>And his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‏أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْء، وَأَنْتَ الْآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">“<em>You are the First One and there was nothing before You, and You are the Last One and there is nothing after You.</em>”</span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the word <em>qadeem</em> (قديم – the ancient one) is not applied to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, except in the sense of informing about Him.  As for calling Him with that name, then there is not from His Names “<em>al-qadeem”</em> (the ancient one).  Rather, from His Names is: “<em>Al-Awwal”</em> (الأول &#8211; The First); and the term <em>Al-Awwal</em> (The First) is not the same as saying <em>al-qadeem</em> (the ancient one) because the term <em>al-qadeem</em> (the ancient one) may have someone before Him.  As for the term “<em>Al-Awwal”</em> (The First) then there is nothing before him (one who is first).  As the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“You are the First One and there was nothing before You.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> made a precaution here and he said, <strong>“The Ancient One without any beginning,”</strong> and if he had just said “<strong>The Ancient One</strong>” and remained silent then that would not be correct in meaning.  [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Muslim in the Book of <em><u>Dh</u>ikr</em> and <em>Du`aa</em>. and <em>Tawbah</em> and <em>Isti<u>gh</u>faar</em>.  It is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would recite this <em>du`aa</em>. when he would go to bed (as part of a longer supplication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s side point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdul-`Azeez Ibn Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says about this same point, <strong>“The Ancient One without any beginning”</strong>: The wording <em>qadeem </em>does not occur amongst the Perfect Names of Allaah as the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) and others explained.  But many of the people of theological rhetoric mention that phrase about Allaah, that He is <em>Qadeem, </em>to affirm that His existence came before everything.  However, the Names of Allaah are <em>tawqeefiyyah – </em>they can only be affirmed with a text from the Noble Book or the authentic Sunnah. It is not permissible to affirm anything from His Names based upon opinion as the <em>imaams</em> of the <em>Salafu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aali<u>h</u></em> have stated.  And the word ‘<em>al-qadeem</em>’ (the ancient one), does not indicate the meaning which the people of theological rhetoric intended because the wording ‘<em>al-qadeem</em>’ (that which is ancient) in the Arabic language means that which preceded something else even though it itself did not exist at one time, such as occurs in the saying of Allaah, the Perfect,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Until it returned like the old ancient date stalk<br />
</strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the correct meaning is only indicated by the addition which the author mentioned, “<strong>The Ancient One without any beginning”</strong> but it is not befitting to count that amongst the Perfect Names of Allaah since it is not established in texts and we are sufficed in that regard by His Name, He the Perfect, <em>‘Al-Awwal’</em> (The First One),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He (Allaah) is the First and the Last</strong><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p>And Allaah is the One who grants success.<br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F318777952&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [36]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, guides whomever He wishes and He misguides whomever He wishes; and this is by the <em>Qa<u>d</u>aa</em>.  (القضاء – Ordainment) and <em>Qadr</em> (قدر – Pre-decree) of Allaah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>However, He guides those whom He knows are fitting to receive guidance and He guides those who eagerly seek out guidance and who devote themselves to it; then Allaah makes good easy for him.  And He misguides whomever He wishes by reason of that person’s turning away from seeking guidance and good; then Allaah misguides him as a punishment for him for turning away and for his lack of desire for good.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is made clear by His, the Most High, saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>As for the one who gives in charity and is dutiful to Allaah and attests to what is true, then we make easy for him acting in obedience to Allaah. </em></span>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>5-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the cause is found with the servant, and the Pre-decree is from Allaah, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And as for the one who miserly and thinks himself self-sufficient and denies that which is true, then We make easy for him the path to evil. </em></span>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>8-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the cause is found with the person, and the Pre-decree is from Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  However, Allaah decreed that for him as a punishment for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah decreed guidance as a favour from Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic, and He bestowed honour upon the person who wishes and desires guidance and desires good.  Then for him, Allaah makes the good easy and easy for him to perform it.  And this is for the person’s benefit; it is not for the benefit of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  And as for misguiding of the misguided people, then that is justice from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and as a recompense for them for their turning away and for their and not turning to good and to obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He does not wrong them whatsoever.  And therefore we find in the <em>aayaat</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah does not guide the people who are transgressors</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>258)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah does not guide the unbelieving people</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>264)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah does not guide the wicked evil-doers</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>108)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made wrongdoing and unbelief and wickedness reasons for the absence of guidance.  And these things are actions of the people for which He recompenses them as justice from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, not as injustice or oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah did not oppress them but rather they wronged their own souls. </span></em>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not befitting for Him, He the Perfect, that He should bestow honour upon one with those characteristics.  And likewise, it is not befitting upon Him, He the Perfect and Most High, that He should cause the deeds of those who act, to be lost.  He, the One free of all imperfections said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Do those people who commit sins think that they will be made just the same as those who truly believe and perform righteous deeds, in their present lives and after death? Evil is the judgement that they make. </em></span>(Sooratul-Jaa<u>th</u>iyah (45), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah created the heavens and the earth in Truth so that He should recompense every soul in accordance with what it earned; and they will not be oppressed.</span></em> (Sooratul-Jaa<u>th</u>iyah (45), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Shall we make the Muslims just like the criminals? What is it with you – how do you judge?</span></em> (Sooratul-Qalam (68), <em>aayaat </em>35-36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would be oppression, which Allah is free of.  He, the Perfect and Most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Shall we make those who truly believe and work righteous and correct actions, (shall we make them just the same) as those who cause corruption upon the earth, or shall we make those who are dutiful to Allaah just like the wicked folk?</em></span> (Soorah <u>S</u>aad (38), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High does not lose the reward of one who works a righteous and correct action, and He does not punish anyone for something which he did not do and for something which he did not earn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>You will not be recompensed except for that which you used to do. </em></span>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aaffaat (37), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the actions, all of them, whether good or bad, are from the person; and the recompense is from Allaah out of His Favour and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [36][1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span> :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s (Dawud Burbank) side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his longer explanation, commenting about this point, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains a refutation of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> with regard to their saying that it is obligatory upon Allaah that He must always do what is most beneficial for the person; and this is a question of guidance and misguidance.  So the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say, “Guidance is from Allaah and it means explaining the correct way” and they say, “Misguidance is just calling a person ‘misguided’ and that He, the Most High, judges the person to be upon misguidance when the servant himself creates misguidance for himself.” And this is built upon their false and futile principle – that the actions of the people are created by them.  And the proof for what we have stated is the proof of Allaah, the Most High (addressing the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>You do not guide those whom you love should be guided, but rather Allaah guides whomever He wishes </em></span>(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if guidance was just explaining the correct way, it would not be correct for guidance to be denied for the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in this <em>aayah</em> because he showed the correct way to those whom he loved and those whom he hated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if We wished We would have given every soul its right guidance</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-Sajdah (32), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah misguides whomever He wishes and He guides whomever He wishes</span></em><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-Muda<u>thth</u>ir (74), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if guidance from Allaah just meant showing the correct way, which is general to every soul, it would not be correct to restrict that by His Will.  And likewise, He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And if it were not for the Favour of my Lord I would have been one of those brought to the Hellfire</span></em><strong> </strong>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aaffaat (37), <em>aayah </em>57)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Whomever Allaah wishes, He misguides him, and whomever He wishes, He places him upon a straight path</em></span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Believers Will See Their Lord In The Hereafter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] <em>Ahl us-Sunnah</em> believe and testify that the Believers will see their Lord, The Most Blessed and The Most High, on the Day of judgement with their eyes. They will look at Him, as it is reported in the authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> from the Messenger of Allaah, (صلى الله عليه وسلم). He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, you will see your Lord like you see the full Moon. ”</span> </em>[105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comparison (like) mentioned in this hadeeth is between the two (seeing’s) not between that which is seen in each case.[106] The <em>ahaadeeth</em> of the vision are related in the book <em>al-Intisaar</em> with all the <em>asaaneed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[105] Related by Ibn Khuzaimah in <em>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</em> [ 1:407-411 ]. See also al-Bukhaaree [554], Muslim [183l and Aboo Dawood [ 4729 ]. The Prophet, (صلى الله عليه وسلم ), said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Most Mighty and the Most Majestic, will say: ‘<strong>Do you wish for anything extra that I may give you</strong>?’ They will say: Have you not brightened our faces? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the fire? So He will remove the screen and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them, than looking at their Lord, the Most Mighty and the Most Majestic.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Related by Muslim [181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[106] i.e The similarity between seeing the full moon and seeing Allaah is in the seeing, not between the full moon and Allaah. This fine point is a refutation on those who claim that Ahl us Sunnah here have made a comparison between Allaah and His creation ( i.e. the full moon).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Title: “I Have Forbidden Oppression”<br />
شرح األربعني النبوييه :Title Original<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī (رضي الله عنه) reported that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) narrated that his lord said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Oh my servants, I have forbidden oppression even for myself, and I have made it forbidden among you as well, so do not oppress one another.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, <strong>“Oh my servants, I have made oppression forbidden even for myself,”</strong> and He (Azza wa Jal) may make something forbidden upon himself because the decision is His. As for us, we make nothing forbidden for Him, but He may forbid something upon Himself as he wishes just as He may obligate and decree something upon Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read the statement of Allah (تعالى ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “To who belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has decreed upon himself mercy.</span></strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pledged upon himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“My mercy surpasses my anger.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also made oppression forbidden among us as he says, “And I have made it forbidden among you as well.” This includes a person oppressing himself or others. However, the second meaning is more apparent as he then says, “So do not oppress one another.” Meaning: None of you may oppress another individual. Still, it is known that oppression may occur against oneself or against another;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And we did not oppress them, but they oppressed themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for oppression, ظُلْم ẓulm, often revolves around failing to give someone else his or her rights or it could linguistically mean “shortcomings” as in the following verse as Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything.&#8221;</strong></span>[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This understanding of oppression—failing to give others their rights—is of two types: 1) refusing to fulfill an obligation to another person, and 2) unlawfully forcing another person to do something which he should not have to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of the first type would be if you were to refuse to repay a debt to someone or to even postpone payment based on the prophet’s statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;A rich person’s (one with means to repay) postponement (of repaying) is oppression.&#8221;</strong></span> [8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an example of the second type would be if you claimed someone owed you something and you deceitfully produced evidence of the claim so that the individual was forced to pay – this is oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">By Allah’s command, “So do not oppress one another,” is there any exception to this order?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, oppression is forbidden under all circumstances, no exceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it permissible for us to take the wealth or possessions of the Muā’had?</strong></span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, it is neither permissible for us to take the wealth and possessions of those with whom we have an understood agreement of peace, nor is it permissible for us to take their blood. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever murders a Muā’had will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise although its fragrance can be smelled from forty years away</span></strong>. [10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for his help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, we know the extent of the aggression, oppression, and utter misguidance of those arrogant individuals who hostilely transgress in taking the wealth and possessions of Muā’had unbelievers regardless of whether they are non-Muslims living peacefully with you in your land or if you were in their lands. We hear of some youths in non-Muslim lands claiming there is nothing wrong with taking wealth or ruining the possessions of disbelievers. You find them breaking street lights, destroying shops, and smashing cars. This is impermissible in Islam. Glorified is Allah! A nation of people accepts you as guests into their lands, you are under their authority and their agreement of trust and yet you betray them. This is the severest form of misrepresenting and dishonoring Islam; it is slandering and disgracing Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the dishonor and disgrace is not actually against Islam. Rather it is against those individuals themselves – those who claim ascription to Islam. For that, it is incumbent to know that the wealth of non-Muslims under a trust or agreement of peace is sacred regardless of whether they are living peacefully among you or you with them in their lands. It is forbidden to show aggression and hostility against them because that is oppression.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]This article is taken from selected parts of Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of ḥadīth twenty-four of the famous forty-two ḥadīth collection by Imām an-Nawawī known as “al-‘Arba’īn al-Nawawī” or “Nawawī’s Forty (Ḥadīth).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This ḥadīth is actually much longer but only this portion is explained herein for brevity and for the article’s focus on the topic of oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Recorded by Muslim (no. 2577), Aḥmad (5/153, 160, 177), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2495), and Ibn Mājah (no. 4257).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The Quran, Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is a ḥadīth qudsī recorded by Muslim, al-Bukhārī, al-Nasāī, and Ibn Mājah. In the text of Muslim, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah created the creation, He pledged upon Himself in his book which is with him over his throne, “My mercy certainly overcomes my anger.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The Quran, Sūrah Hūd, 11:101.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] The Quran, Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:33.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 2166) and Muslim (no. 1564).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator’s Note: Muā’had refers to non-Muslims with whom Muslims have a stated or understood agreement of peace. This may be in the form of official documents (such as entry visas into one another’s countries) or the lack of any official, government-sponsored declaration of war. Thus, the actions of today’s Muslim terrorists, as they declare whole groups or nations of non-Muslims as enemy combatants as they see fit, are neither Islamic nor are they in conjunction with the ḥadīth above (and many other Islamic texts), and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 3166).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah the most Beneficent the most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The True God is Allaah, And Man is Need of Him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is no true god worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is Allaah’s true slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term <em><strong>worship</strong> </em>in Islam translates to a code of life, because worship means everything which Allaah loves from actions and (or) sayings that are apparent and (or) hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are those who do not believe in Allaah as the Only True God. Many as well believe that there is a Creator. However, they are in state of confusion as to who is this Creator. In this article a presentation is aimed to direct to the conclusion that Allaah is the true &#8220;God&#8221;, the Creator, and that man is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator must be the creator of everything, the heavens, the earth an all that is in between them, mankind and all that exists. It is anticipated that anyone who says “I believe in the Creator,” that he believes in this. It also entails that he should necessarily believe that the Creator possesses Perfect Attributes. He is Perfect in His attributes, in Himself, in His Names, and in His Actions. This is a natural flow, otherwise, it is a delusion not a true belief in the &#8220;Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I believe in a Perfect Creator,&#8221; should lead to another obvious admission: if you believe that the Creator is Perfect then He is Perfectly Wise in all of His Actions. Does He then Create because of a Perfect Wisdom, or aimlessly? This is the important linkage. Does He Create for a need? Or He Creates based upon Wisdom? It is anticipated that to be in harmony with having belief in the Creator, that His Wisdom is necessarily is linked to His Knowledge, His Will and to all of His Attributes. The question, therefore, would you think the One who creates does so for a purpose or He creates to leave the creation aimless? The person who believes the Creator is Perfect, would agree that His creating is not aimless. If so, then Who else other than Allaah has stated this? And you know where? It is in His Final Revelation to man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate what He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Did you think that We have created you in play without any purpose and that you will not be brought back to us, so exalted be Allaah the true king none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne”</strong></span> [Quran 23: 115-116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left aimless (without purpose)?</strong></span> [Quran, 75:36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the One whom you believe to be &#8220;the Creator.&#8221; He chose this title for Himself and He stated that He is the Only Creator, and that He Creates with Wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth!</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 40:62].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So this creation which Allaah creates must have a code organizing its existence and its aims. Hence:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Allaah creates and His creating is all Wise and for a purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Allaah did not leave us aimless. He set a code to live accordingly. So He legislates, commands, and prohibits, and justly sets reward and accountability, because He is all Just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- In all aspects of this code, the manifestations of His Names and Attributes become known, contemplated and realized. Being the Creator necessitates creating as well as purpose, guidance and legislations. Whoever ascribes is rewarded, since He is the Most Generous. When one commits a sin, he realizes that his Creator accepts repentance and is oft-Forgiving. So the manifestations of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes become realized on earth and this is beloved to Allaah, the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Allaah gives man life, physical sustenance, and spiritual guidance through the revelation which He entrusted His Messengers with. He guides man to know how to benefit from the provisions, what is good for him and what is harmful. He raises in honor those who submitted to Him, and justly puts in humiliation those who disdain and are arrogant. He Forgives and is Merciful; He punishes and rewards in order that man shapes his life with the code that is all beneficial to man and which makes his life on this earth upright. And it cannot be upright unless man ascribes to the guidance sent to him by His creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- If all mankind come to ascribe to his code (i.e. worship) Allaah on one heart, then this does not oblige any change in Allaah&#8217;s Essence nor in His Attributes. If all the creation is on one heart, this does not increase in the dominion of Allaah anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why He stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But Allah is free of all wants, and it is ye that are needy.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 47:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-And that is why He mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you do good, you do good for your own selves”</span> </strong>[Qur&#8217;an, 17:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever does righteous good deeds, then such will prepare a good place in paradise for themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 30:44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) related in the authentic hadith that Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O My slaves, you will not attain harm in Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefit in Me so as to benefit Me; O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that will not increase My Kingdom in anything; O my slaves, were the first of you and last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that will not decrease My Kingdom in anything; O My slaves, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and I recompense you for. So let him who finds good praise Allaah and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported in Saheeh Muslim, No. 6246]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On daily basis the person makes what is known as ritual purity (wudu). In every drop of water used to wash the face, hands, arms, head, and feet, sins fall off. It is therefore a tangible and intangible benefit to man. Listen to what Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty but He wants to purify you and to complete His favour upon you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;an, 5:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also concerning the ritual of offering a sacrificial animal (from the cattle) in the pilgrimage, we read in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah but it is piety from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 22:37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In human to human relationship, people do good for each other to attain their own interests, or to be praised. But with Allaah, if you do good, you do good for yourself, because this good that you do does not benefit Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In light of the above, we need to contemplate the great purpose for which we have been created. This is clearly stated by Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And Allaah have not created not the jinn and the men except that they should worship me alone.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 51: 56-57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are called for what benefits them. Remember the definition of worship in the beginning of this discussion? They are the ones who, if they comply, will win. And that is why He asserted in the next verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me.”</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 51:57].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allaah mention food and provisions here? It is traditionally known that the greatest need for man is the need for food, clothing and residence. This requires means and provisions, and this is the wealth. That is why Allaah began with it: <strong>“I seek not any provision from them,”</strong> and then He referred to food, because it is the thing most needed by people: <strong>“nor do I ask that they should feed Me,&#8221;</strong> because He is all-Rich, free of all want; Self-Sufficient, needs nothing. He related to us in things we relate closely to so as to make this matter vividly clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the creation of man is not to bring a benefit for Allaah, but to establish this code of life which links him to his Creator. The Noble objective is to submit and deliver. Otherwise there can be no love of our Creator without submission. And to deliver so as to establish uprightness. But who defines what is good and upright? It is laid down by the one who is All-Knowing and Perfect: Allaah. If it is left to us, then your good is an evil to me and vice versa! So, the code of life is set in accordance with what Allaah has defined as worship, outwardly, and inwardly. So imagine someone saying he loves Allaah and worships others besides Him or to the exclusion of Him! This is neither submission nor compliance. That is why love and magnification of Allah means worshipping none but Him. This is the essence of all the revealed Messages to all the Prophets and Messengers. It is a single Message of Tawheed: singling Allaah alone as the true God worthy of worship and disassociating from any kind of worship to other than Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We often hear people say: what is important is &#8220;love.&#8221; In reality, the true love is the love of Allaah, our Creator, sustainer, and provider. No one is more beloved to Allaah than the one who loves Him and praises Him and complies with His code which He has set for us in this life. Shirk (opposite of Tawheed): associating partners with Allaah in worship is the most hated thing to Allaah because this diminishes (or may eliminate) the love of Allaah. It sets between Allaah and man an associate, and that is why Allaah does not love it. It takes away from the love of Allaah alone and equates Allaah, the Perfect, with the imperfect. This is not even acceptable in human relations. So one must not set up any rival to Allaah in worship. Allaah warned about this, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And of mankind are some who take for worship others besides Allaah as rivals, they love them as they love Allaah but those who believe love Allaah more than anything else.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an 2, 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the truly beneficial thing to man is to know of His Creator, magnify Him, and love Him so that he gains His love and thus be amongst the happy ones in this life and in the hereafter. However, since man has tendencies towards his own lusts and desires, then this objective cannot be attained except when man follows what is pleasing to His Creator, Allaah. The stronger man&#8217;s love of Allaah is, the more he gains of His love and guidance. In practice this needs to be translated into compliance with the code of life set by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is in need of Allaah is the created, because the One who is Self Sufficient and Perfect is Allaah. It is out of His generosity and benevolence that He is rewarding for singling Him alone in worship. And in that, His names and attributes become manifested, and this is beloved to Him. He loves for the person to repent; He loves for the person to return to Him in repentance; He loves forgiving; He loves pardoning; He loves clemency, and He loves justice because He is All-Just. When man realizes the manifestations of Allaah’s Names, Attributes and actions in the creation, then he knows the meaning of worship and clings to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that in this discussion, there is a benefit for the person who says that he believes in the Creator, and that it takes him to the final conclusion of submitting to Allaah in Islam. As to those who do not believe in Allaah, they are directed to the discussions we have on this matter under the title: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/02/21/who-deserves-to-be-worshipped-alone-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>&#8220;who deserves to be worshipped alone”</strong></a> on the site <a href="http://www.understandislam.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.understandislam.net</a>. And all Praise is due to Allaah, the most Beneficent the most Merciful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Book: <strong>How are we Obligated to Interpret the Qur’aan?</strong> Shaykh al-Albanee.<br />
<strong>[ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-are-we-obligated-to-interpret-the-noble-quraan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Download complete PDF book</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[5] Question</strong>: Allaah informs us about Himself saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَكَرُواْ وَمَكَرَ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاآِرِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they plotted and Allaah too plotted. And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 54]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Perhaps the minds of some people may limit the understanding of this ayah to just its apparent meaning. And maybe we are not in need of explaining it. But how is it that Allaah is the best of plotters?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question is easy by the Grace of Allaah. This is since we are able to understand that plotting is not always necessarily characterized with being evil nor is it always necessarily characterized with being good. So perhaps a disbeliever may plot against a Muslim however this Muslim is bright and clever and not heedless and stupid. So he is aware of the plots of his disbelieving opponent and thus deals with him in retaliation to his plot. This is such that the end result is that this Muslim through his good plotting compels the disbeliever’s evil plot to backfire on his own self. So can it be said that when this Muslim plotted against the disbeliever, he engaged in an illegal affair? No one says this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is easy to comprehend this fact from the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong>“War is deception.” [</strong>14] What can be said about deception is exactly the same that can be said about plotting. A Muslim deceiving his Muslim brother is forbidden. However, if a Muslim deceives a disbeliever who is an enemy to Allaah and an enemy to His Messenger, this is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is obligatory. The same goes for a Muslim plotting against a disbeliever who intends to plot against him, such that this Muslim reverses the plot of this disbeliever. This is a good form of plotting. This is a human being and that is a human being. But what do we say with respect to the Lord of all that exists, the All-Able, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidates the plots of all the plotters. This is why Allaah says: <strong>“And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> So when Allaah describes Himself with this description, our attention shuld be directed to the fact that plotting – even on the part of humans – is not always negative. This is since Allaah says: <strong>“The best of plotters.”</strong> So there is plotting that is good and plotting that is bad. So whoever plots for a good reason should not be condemned. And Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, is as He says, the <strong>“best of plotters.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, I say: Whatever suppositions may come to your mind, Allaah is contrary to that. So if a person imagines something that is not befitting to Allaah, then he should know right away that he is wrong. Hence this ayah contains praise for Allaah, so there is nothing in it that is impermissible to ascribe to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Ayah: His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mountain is among the hardest of what there is, the rocks by which the mountain becomes firm are exemplary in hardness. Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;When, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness&#8221;</strong></span> (Al- Baqara 2:74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon the mountain, you would surely see this mountain humbling itself and cleaving out of the fear of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Humbling&#8221; &#8211; that is, submissively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from its severe fright of of Allah, &#8220;Rending asunder&#8221; it cleaves and tears apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is sent down upon our hearts, and our hearts &#8211; except as Allah wills &#8211; contract and become hard, neither opening nor accepting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who believe, when the Ayat (of the Qur&#8217;an) are sent down to them, it increases their faith; but as for those who have a disease in their hearts; it adds filth to their filth; and it is Allah whose refuge is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of that is that their hearts become more inflexible and hardened and it adds filth to their filth. We seek refuge in Allah from that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down to the mountain, it would cleave and humble itself due to the greatness of Allah&#8217;s Words sent down upon it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this, there is evidence that the mountains have senses, because it humbles itself and cleaves. The matter is like that. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said concerning Uhud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is Uhud, a mountain that loves us, and which we love</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this Hadith, we also recognize the refutation against those who affirm that there are metaphors in the Qur&#8217;an. Those who always raise their flag, using this Ayah as proof:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then they found therein a wall wanting to collapse&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Kahf 18:77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying: &#8220;How can the wall want?&#8221; We say: Subhan Allah! The Knowing, and The Aware says : &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; and you are saying that it does not want! Is this sensible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not your right, after this, that you sav: &#8220;How could it want?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes us ask ourselves: Are we given the knowledge of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that we are not given knowledge, except a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for us to object to the statement of the One Who knows the hidden and the witnessed: &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; by saying: &#8220;The wall does not have an Iradah (a want)! And It does not want to collapse!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the evils of metaphors, because it implies a negation of what the Qur&#8217;an affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not Allah, Exalted is He, Who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification</span></strong>&#8221; {Al-Israa&#8217; 17: 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they glorify Him, without wanting to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: &#8220;<strong>Tusabbih Lahu (they glorify Him)</strong>&#8220;: the Lam is to specify. Thus, it means sincerely. Is it imaginable to have sincerity without an Iradah (volition, objective, will)? Therefore, they will, and everything wills, for Allah says: &#8220;<strong>And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise</strong>.&#8221; I think it is clear to all of us that this is one of the ways of expressing generality, because In (here) means Ma (not), which negates. Also, &#8220;<strong>A thing</strong>&#8221; is an indefinite pronoun used in the context of negation. &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But glorifies His Praise</strong></span>&#8221; by that, it includes everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my Muslim brother, if you see that your heart is not moved by the Qur&#8217;an, accuse yourself, because Allah has informed that if this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon a mountain, it would cleave, and the Qur&#8217;an is recited to your heart, yet and it is not moved. We ask Allah to aid us, and you.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. He Who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and He sent down from the clouds rain, and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you, so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him. </strong></span>[2:21-22]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>9</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">9</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped</strong>”: meaning, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped, as for other than Him, then it does not deserve worship, because it is not a Lord. This is the intent of the speech of the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his saying, “<em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped”, meaning He is the One Who deserves worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also it is not sufficient that a person just affirms <em>Ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship), rather he must affirm <em>Al-‘Uboodiyyah</em> (Allaah’s deserving all worship), He the Perfect and Most High, and he must carry it out making it purely and sincerely for Him, the Perfect and Most High. So since he has affirmed that He is <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) then it is binding upon him to affirm that he is <em>Al-Ma‘bood</em> (the One Who therefore deserves to be worshipped), and that others besides Him do not deserve anything from worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof that worship is particular to the Lord is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. He Who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and He sent down from the clouds rain, and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you, so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him. </strong></span>[2:21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind</strong>” <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ</strong> </span>: this is a call from Allaah to the whole of mankind, the believers and the unbelievers, for Allaah has mentioned in this <em>soorah, soorat-ul-Baqarah</em>, that mankind is divided into three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first category:</span> </strong>are the believers, those who truly believe in the hidden and unseen and who truly believe in the Last Day. And He has described them as being the ones who are successful in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They (the believers) are upon guidance from their Lord and they are the ones who are the successful ones </strong></span>[2:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second category</span>: </strong>are the unbelievers, those who openly display disbelief and obstinate rejection. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا سَوَاءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed those who obstinately disbelieve, it is the same whether you warn them or you do not warn them, they will not believe. </strong></span>[2:6]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third category: </strong></span>the Hypocrites, who are not with the disbelievers, and they are not with the believers:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ لَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ وَلَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Wavering in between, being neither fully with these nor fully with those </strong></span>[4:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are believers outwardly, however they are disbelievers inwardly, and they are worse than the disbelievers who openly display their unbelief, and therefore He sent down ten and more <em>aayahs</em> with regard to them, whereas regarding the believers He sent down just a few <em>aayahs</em>, and regarding the disbelievers two <em>aayahs</em>. As for the Hypocrites, then He began mentioning them from His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from the people are those who say, “We believe”</span> </strong>[2:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">up to His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The lightening almost snatches their sight away </strong></span>[2:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is regarding the Hypocrites because of the severity of their danger and of the foulness of their action. And having mentioned these three types, He then said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind </strong></span>[2:21]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a call to all of the types, the believers and the disbelievers and the Hypocrites. The scholars have said: the first call occuring in the <em>Mus-<u>h</u>af </em>(written copy of the Qur’aan) is this:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind, worship your Lord </strong></span>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Worship</strong>!”: this is a command, meaning make all worship purely and sincerely for Him. Why? Because He is your Lord, and worship is not correct except for the Lord, the Perfect and Most High. Then He mentioned the proof for that, and it His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He Who created you </strong></span>[2:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And those who came before you</strong>”: from the nations, all of them. Allaah the Perfect and Most High created the angels and the <em>jinn</em> and mankind and all of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>So that you should have <em>taqwaa</em> (be dutiful to Allaah seeking to avoid His anger and punishment)</strong>”: if you reflect upon this, so then perhaps this will result for you in <em>taqwaa </em>(dutifulness to Allaah), if you reflect that He is the One Who created you and created those who were before you, perhaps you will seek then to protect yourselves from Him, He the Perfect and Most High in worshipping Him, because nothing can protect from His punishment except obedience to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. Perhaps you will seek to protect yourselves from His Punishment and seek to protect yourselves from the Fire, because nothing will protect from it except the worship of your Lord Who created you and those who came before you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He continued the mention of evidence for His Lordship and His right to worship, He the Perfect and Most High with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He Who made for you the earth as a resting place” </strong></span>[2:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning like a carpet:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ بِسَاطًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah has made the earth as a carpet laid out for you</strong></span> [71:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning laid out and, “as a carpet”, meaning which you use as a carpet, you sleep upon it and you build upon it, and you cultivate crops upon its surface and you travel about upon it on your journeys to wherever you want to go. So the earth is a carpet and a resting place:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْأَرْضَ فَرَشْنَاهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَاهِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have laid out the earth as a carpet for you and what an excellent spreader of it We are. </strong></span>[51:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For your welfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And the sky as a canopy / ceiling</strong>”: so the sky is a ceiling for the earth and it contains things which result in the welfare of the servants.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He sent down from the clouds in the sky rainwater and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that there is no Lord besides Him </strong></span>[2:22]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jābir ( رضي الله عنه) said: Three days before he died, I heard the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">« لاَ يَمُوتَنَّ أَحَدُكُمْ إِلاَّ وَهُوَ يُحْسِنُ الظَّنَّ بِاللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ »</h2>
<p>[11] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah</strong></span> (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Nawawī’s Explanation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is again from al-Nawawī’s explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the statement of the prophet » None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah « scholars have said that this is a warning against losing hope and despairing (of Allah’s mercy) and an encouragement to have hope especially at the time of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) also said in the previous ḥadīth » “<strong>I am as my servant thinks of Me</strong>.” « and (considering both ḥadīth) scholars explain that » <strong>having good thoughts about Allah</strong> « means that an individual should expect Allah to have mercy on him and pardon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have also said that during times of wellbeing and health, an individual should have both hope and fear in Allah and these two feelings should be equally balanced. Others say that one’s fear should be more, but when the signs of death approach, a person’s hope in Allah’s mercy should become stronger. This is because the very purpose of having fear of Allah is to prevent oneself from committing sins and ugly deeds and to increase in obedience and good deeds. And those things are most often not possible during that situation (i.e., during the last moments of one’s death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Instead, in that situation, assuming good thoughts about Allah is preferable which would cause one to have feelings of destitution and submission and to feel oneself in total need of Allah (تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ḥadīth mentioned by Imām Muslim right after this one also supports this understanding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« يُبْعَثُ كُلُّ عَبْدٍ عَلَى مَا مَاتَ عَلَيْهِ »</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every servant will be resurrected according to what he died upon</strong>.[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars explain that it means each individual will be resurrected in the same state in which he died. The next ḥadīth (in Imām Muslim’s authentic collection) also supports this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ عَذَابًا أَصَابَ الْعَذَابُ مَنْ كَانَ فِيهِمْ ثُمَّ بُعِثُوا عَلَى<br />
أَعْمَالِهِمْ.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah intends to punish an entire group of people, the punishment afflicts them all, but then each is resurrected according to (his individual) deeds</strong></span>.[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the ḥadīth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« إِنَّمَا يُبْعَثُ النَّاسُ عَلَى نِيَّاتِهِمْ »</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>People will only be resurrected upon their (individual) intentions.</strong></span> [14]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Manāwī’s Explanation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following explanation is from al-Manāwī’s, Fayḍ al-Qadīr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) statement » None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah « means: Let none of you die under any circumstance except while in the state of thinking good about Allah (تعالى) in that He will be merciful with you and pardon you. This is because when a person’s time of passing arrives and his journey comes to an end, his fear (of Allah) has no real purpose (to prevent him from bad deeds during life). It would perhaps lead him to despair and to a feeling of restriction of (Allah’s) mercy and bounties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever at that time, even if his heart were laden with major sins, begins expecting the best (of his Lord) and increases in hope, he has then perfected his provisions for his arrival to his Lord…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Ṭībī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) instructs one to ensure he does not die in any state other than expecting and assuming good about Allah. And this does not mean one can change destiny or fate. Rather, what is intended is that an individual is commanded to have good thoughts (about Allah) so that when death overcomes him, he is in such a state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Selections [1] from Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[1] Taken from Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam, an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām al-Nawawī. The ḥadīth explained in this article is number nineteen.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:<br />
<span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<strong>Know Allah in prosperity, He will know you in adversity</strong></span>.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a worshipper is conscious and fearful of Allah in times of ease and wellbeing, preserving His rules and paying careful attention to His rights upon him, he begins to know Allah. There is then established between him and his Lord a special relationship. In return, his Lord will remember and know His worshipper during his times of hardship. He will preserve and take care of such person’s relationship with Him in difficult times. Because of this relationship, Allah saves his worshipper from his difficulties. This special relationship brings an individual close to his Lord and ensures His love for him and His answering of his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A person’s “knowing his Lord” is of two types:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A general knowledge. When a person is familiar with Allah is this manner, he simply accepts that He exists, affirms correct belief in Him, and has faith in Him. All believers in general know Allah in this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A specific knowledge and relationship. When a person truly knows Allah, he turns his heart completely to Him, devotes himself to Him, and feels at ease with Him. He is comforted when Allah is mentioned although he is still shy before Him and fears Him. Those who truly know Allah focus on this specific type of “knowing Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Similarly, Allah’s “knowing his servant” is of two types.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A general knowledge. This is Allah’s knowledge of all His servants, His observation of everything they conceal or make apparent, as He ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And indeed We have created mankind, and We know what his own self whispers to him.&#8221; </strong></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of this general type of Allah knowing His creation is His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers</span></strong>.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A specific knowledge and relationship. This type of “knowing His servant” is when Allah loves His worshipper, brings him close to Him, answers his prayers, and helps him out of difficulties. This is the type of relationship the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) refers to when he said that Allah says (in a ḥadīth qudsī):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My servant continues to come close to Me with extra acts of worship until I love him. When I love him, I become his ears with which he hears, his eyes with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks. Were he to ask Me for anything, I would certainly give it him, and were he to seek My help, I would certainly help him.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Illustrating this specific type of Allah knowing His servants, there is a report that when al-Ḥasan was fleeing the oppression of al-Ḥajjāj, he came to the house of Ḥabīb Ibn Muḥammad. Ḥabīb said to him, “Abū Saī’d, is there no relationship between you and your Lord by which you could pray to Him to hide you from these people? Come into the house.” al-Ḥasan went inside, and al-Ḥajjāj’s soldiers went in after him but could not see him. When that was mentioned to al-Ḥajjāj, he said, “He was inside the house but Allah blinded your eyes so that you could not see him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, whoever shows Allah constant, respectful fear and obedience during times of ease and prosperity, Allah will show him gentleness and assistance during times of difficulty and adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Tirmidhī recorded a ḥadīth from Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever would like Allah to answer him during hardships and difficulties then let him increase in supplication during times of wellbeing.&#8221; </strong></span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most difficult hardship a servant faces in this life is death; what comes after it is even more severe if the servant’s final destination is not good (Paradise). So it is necessary for a believer to prepare for death and what follows it during times of ease and wellbeing by remaining constantly conscious and fearful of Allah and doing righteous deeds (during life). Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Oh you who believe, fear Allah and let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah, indeed Allah is aware of what you do. And do not be like those who forgot Allah so He made them forget about their own souls. Those are the defiantly disobedient ones</strong></span>.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever remembers Allah while in good health, in times of ease and comfort, and prepares himself for his meeting with Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) upon death and afterwards, Allah will in return remember him during these hardships (associated with death). He will be with the person during such difficulties. Allah will be gentle with him as He assists him, takes care of him, and keeps him firm upon the worship of Allah alone (when he dies). Allah will then meet the person while being happy with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, whoever forgets Allah during times of ease and comfort (in life) and fails to prepare for his meeting with Him, Allah will forget him during these hardships (of death). And the “forgetting” here means Allah will abandon the person and disregard him.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when death comes to a true believer in Allah, one who has prepared for it and has good expectations of his Lord, and the good news of Allah comes to him, he then would love to meet Allah and Allah would love to meet him. However, a wicked person is just the opposite of that (i.e., he hates to meet Allah so Allah hates to meet him).[9] The believer is then filled with happiness with what he put forth before him (in life) and with what he is about to arrive at (Paradise). As for someone who is negligent (who forgot about his own soul), he is filled with regret, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Oh, how I regret what I neglected regarding Allah</strong></span>.<strong>&#8220;</strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is part of a longer ḥadīth recorded by Aḥmad, al-Bayhaqī, and al-Lālakāī and Shaykh Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī said it is authentic in his al-Jāmi’ al-Saghīr wa Ziyādatuh (5272).<br />
[3] The Quran, Sūrah Qāf (50:16)<br />
[4] Sūrah al-Najm (53:32)<br />
[5] Recorded by al-Bukhārī<br />
[6] Recorded by al-Tirmidhī (no. 3382) and al-Albānī said it is ḥasan in Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī (no. 2693).<br />
[7] Sūrah al-Ḥashr (59:18-19)<br />
[8] About this type of “forgetting” them, Allah says in Sūrah al-‘Arāf (7:51):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">So today We will forget them just as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and for having rejected Our verses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His ( سبحانسَه وتعالى ) frightening verses in Sūrah ṬāHā (20:124-126):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">And whoever turns away from My remembrance, he will certainly have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind. He will say, “My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I used to see?&#8221; (Allah) will answer, “Likewise Our signs came to you but you forgot them, so likewise you will today be forgotten.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] About this, the messenger of Allah ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said (recorded by al-Bukhārī):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, “<span style="color:#339966;">If my servant loves to meet Me, I love to meet him, and if he hates to meet me, I hate to meet him</span>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So the proof for the <em>shahaadah</em> (testification) is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. Laa ilaah illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:18] </strong><sup>33</sup><strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33]:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, he the most high, &#8220;<strong>He testified</strong>&#8220;: meaning He judged and He decreed and He informed and He made clear and He made it binding. So bearing witness from Allaah revolves around these five meanings: <strong>judging</strong>, <strong>decreeing</strong> , <strong>informing</strong> ,<strong>clarifying</strong> and <strong>making binding</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of, &#8220;He testified&#8221;, is He the Perfect and Most High decreed it upon His servants and He calls them to know of it and He informed them and He made it binding upon them that none has the right to be worshipped except Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>laa ilaaha</em>”, (none had the right to be worshipped): this is a negating ‘<em>laa’</em> which negates everything which is worshipped besides Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>illaahu</em>”, (except for Him): this affirms worship for Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of, &#8220;<em>annahu laailaaha illaahu</em>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but him): it means there is nothing that is worshipped rightfully except for Allaah the Perfect and Most High. As for those who are worshipped besides Allaah, then worship of it is false because of His saying He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the true God deserving all worship and those whom they call upon besides Him are futile and false and Allaah He is the Most High the Most Great [22:62]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Perfect and Most High testifies to His unity and the right to all worship and He is the most truthful One Who speaks and His bearing witness He the Perfect and Most High is the truest testification there can be because it comes from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware, All-Knowing, he knows everything so therefore it is a testification which is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the Angels&#8221;:</strong></span> they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and they are a species of beings whom Allaah created to worship Him. They are honourable Angels, honoured servants, Allaah created them to worship Him. They declare His perfection night and day, and they never slacken. And also Allaah created them to carry out His commands in the creation, He entrusted them with implementing whatever He commanded, He the Perfect and Most High, from the affairs of the creation. So every Angel from them is entrusted with a duty. And their testification is a true testification, because they are people of knowledge, and of ‘<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) and of <em>ma‘rifah</em> (awareness) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they are from the most excellent of the creation, along with the point of disagreement which is are the righteous humans more excellent than the Angels, or are the Angels more excellent than the righteous humans there being disagreement about that point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the people of knowledge”:</strong></span> they are of two categories: the Angels, and the second category are the Possessors of Knowledge from mankind. And the Possessors of Knowledge do not testify except with something that is true, contrary to the case with those who are ignorant people, for their testification is not counted. And every species from the creation of Allaah bears witness for Allaah of His Unity and that none has the right to be worshipped but Him. And this is a case of showing the honour and nobility of the people of knowledge since Allaah joined their testification along with His testification, He the Perfect and Most High, and with the testification of His Angels. He counted the testification of the people of knowledge from the creation, and this shows their excellence and their nobility and their status, and they are testifying to the greatest matter that can be testified to, and it is <em>at-Taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by the Possessors of Knowledge – are the people of knowledge of the Legislation (i.e. Islaamic knowledge), not as is said by some people that people of knowledge means the people of industry and agriculture, so those people, it is not said about them that they are People of Knowledge unrestrictedly, because their knowledge is limited in scope and is restricted, rather it is to be said, “this person is knowledgeable about arithmetic, this person is knowledgeable about engineering, this person is knowledgeable about medicine”, but it is not said about them that they are the People of Knowledge unrestrictedly. Because this term is not used unrestrictedly except for the people who have Islaamic knowledge. And also most of those people are people who have only wordly knowledge, and amongst them are atheists whose knowledge mostly only increases them in ignorance concerning Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and in self delusion and in atheism as you can see today in the disbelieving nations, that they are advanced with regards to industries and with regards to agriculture, however they are disbelievers. So how could it be said that they are the People of Knowledge, those whom Allaah has mentioned in His saying, “and the Possessors of Knowledge”. This is not at all feasible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is only those who have Knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah [35:28]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is the scholars of Islaamic knowledge, those who truly know Allaah and who truly worship Him and who fear Him. As for those people, then most of them do not fear Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Rather they disbelieve in Allaah and deny Him, and they claim that the world has no Lord and that rather nature brought it about and controls it, as is the case with the communists – they reject the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, even though they have worldly knowledge. So how then could we say – those people, they are the People of Knowledge?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an error. So the term ‘Knowledge’ is not applied unrestrictedly except to its true people, and it is a noble title which cannot be applied to atheists and disbelievers, such that it is said, “they are the people of Knowledge”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Angels and the possessors of Knowledge, they bear witness to Allaah’s Unity and sole right to worship. Therefore the saying of others besides them from the atheists and the people of <em>shirk</em> and the Sabeans, those who disbelieve in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, is not counted. Those people, they are not counted, neither they nor their saying, because it is something contrary to the testification of Allaah and the testification of His Angels and the testification of those possessing knowledge from His Creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, “<em>Qaa’imambil-Qis<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span></em>”, (maintaining justice): this phrase is in the accusative case indicating a state along with, ‘He bore witness’ – meaning whilst establishing justice, He the Perfect and Most High. And the word, “<em>al-Qis<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span></em>”, means <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice) – meaning Allaah the Perfect and Most High establishes justice in everything, and <em>al-‘adl</em> (justice), is the opposite of <em>al-jawr</em> (injustice), and He the Perfect and Most High is a just judge, nothing but justice comes from Him in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Laa ilaaha illahu</em>”, (none has the right to be worshipped but Him): this emphasizes the first sentence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Al-‘Azeez-ul-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>akeem</em>”, (the Almighty the All-Wise): these are two Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, comprising two Attributes from His Attributes, and they are <em>al-‘Izzah</em> (Might) and <em>al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ikmah</em> (Wisdom).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Tabaarak Allaah</em></strong>”: means: tremendously great is the One whose actions are these, He the Perfect and Most High. And whose Ability is such and these are the things which He has created, He the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<strong><em>Tabaarak</em></strong>”: is a verb which is used specifically for Him, He the Perfect, so it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him. And <strong><em>al-Barakah</em></strong> (blessing) it means abundance of good and its increase, and the blessings which come from Allaah the Majestic and Most High do not end. As for a created being, it cannot be said about him, “<strong><em>tabaarak</em></strong>”. Rather it can be said to him, “<strong><em>mubaarak</em></strong>” meaning, “May you receive blessing”, meaning may Allaah put blessing into him and make him blessed. And all blessing is from Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Allaahu Akbar<br />
</strong><strong>Allaah is Greater</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That He will call you to account for what your hearts have earned.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:225].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail, except he who comes to Allaah with a dean and pure heart.&#8221;</span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa 79:88-89].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, there is a piece of flesh in the body; if it is sound then all the body is sound. However, if it is diseased, then all the body is diseased Truly that is the heart.&#8221;</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; rahimahullaah -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;So know that the world &#8211; and whatever is above it and below it in the water- will not be corrected except when the actions of its people are all for Allaah. The actions of the body follow on from the actions and intentions of the heart. So when the actions and intentions of the heart are purely for Allaah alone, then it is corrected, and likewise the actions of the body will also be correct. However, if the actions and intentions of the heart are for other than Allaah, then it is corrupted, and likewise the actions of the body will be corrupted in proportion to how much the heart is corrupted.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And he said: &#8220;Hearts will not be corrected until the ma&#8217;rifah (knowledge and realisation) of Allaah &#8211; being in awe of His greatness, loving Him, fearing Him, hoping in Him, relying and trusting in Him &#8211; is not firmly implanted in them. This is the reality of Tawheed and the meaning of the saying: Laa ilaaha illallaah (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). Thus, hearts will not be corrected until Allaah is made the ilaah (deity) to be known, to be loved, feared and hoped in, and that He &#8211; along with this &#8211; becomes the only ilaah (deity) worthy of this, without associating any partner to Him in this.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we may begin to appreciate the greatness of Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; and being in awe of Him, by considering some narrations regarding what He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. Heaven has groaned, and it has a right to do so. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! There is not in the heaven a space equivalent to four fingers, except than an angel has prostrated his forehead to Allaah in it. By Allaah! If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep a lot, and you would not take delight in women in their beds, but rather would go to the wilderness and implore Allaah for help.&#8221;</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The seven Heavens compared to the Kursee (the Chair) is like a ring which is thrown into a desert. And such is the magnitude of the &#8216;Arsh (the Throne of Allaah) compared with the Kursee.&#8221;</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I have been given permission to relate to you about the Angels of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that carry the &#8216;Arsh (Throne). Between one of the Angel&#8217;s ear and shoulder is a distance of seven hundred year journey.&#8221;</span> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Al-Baytul-Mamoor is in the seventh heaven [directly above the Ka &#8216;bah]. Each day seventy thousand angels enter it, and they will not return until the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</span> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So: &#8220;the need of the servants for this (type of) knowledge is greater then every other need; end it is the most necessary of all things for them, since there is no life for the hearts, nor any delight, nor any tranquility, except through knowing their Lord, the only One Who deserves to be worshipped, their Creator &#8211; with His Names, His Attributes and His Actions, and that He &#8211; along with all that &#8211; is more beloved to the person than anything else. So man&#8217;s striving is with regards to everything that will draw him nearer to Allaah, to the exclusion of the creation &#8230; So the people who know Allaah the best, are the ones who best follow the way to Him; and know best whet lies at the end of the way.&#8221; [8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One may notice that sometimes Allâh refers to Himself by We or Us. This is not an indication of different &#8220;personalities&#8221; or &#8220;forms&#8221; of Allâh as it is the case in the Trinity concept of the Catholic Church. Allâh (God) is One.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of <strong>We and Us is always associated with verses referring to Allâh&#8217;s Greatness in His Lordship</strong> e.g. Creation, Power, Might, etc&#8230; This is very common in the Arabic Language. a king issues orders or statements by saying &#8220;We&#8221; or &#8220;Us.&#8221; The power and might of any king is imperfect. Allâh Glorification of Himself is Perfect because He is Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His address to mankind by <strong>calling them to direct their worship to Him, Allâh always refers to Himself by I, Me and Myself</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is well understood in Arabic and also in other Semitic languages. Even in English, there is the &#8220;<strong>Royal We and Us</strong>&#8221; as we hear it from statements by members of the Royal Family in England and elsewhere. To Allâh, however, belongs the Best Examples, Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the full attestation that Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High, exists. No one openly denied the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, except by way of haughtiness. Otherwise it is impossible for any reasonable person to claim that this creation was appeared by chance or it came into existence without a cause, due to the fact that this is something impossible to occur as agreed upon by the people of sound intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, is something proven by all kinds of evidences:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Rational<br />
(ii) Fitriyyah [from Fitrah: Natural disposition],<br />
(iii) Legal, and<br />
(iv) Hissiyyah [from Hiss: What is experienced and perceived].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these four evidences prove the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>intellectual proof,</strong></span> then it is that we witness the existence of this universe and what occurs in it from things which is rather impossible for any creature to do. The existence of creation: the heavens, the earth and what is in them from the stars, mountains, rivers, trees, the speaking, the speechless, and so forth. How did this existence come into being? Did it appear by chance? Or did it occur without a cause? Or did it bring itself into existence? These are three possibilities whereby the intellect does not accept a fourth possibility. All of these possibilities are futile and false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>it appearing by chance</strong>, then this is something that the intellect as well as reality itself denies, because you cannot bring such magnificent creation into existence just by chance; there must be a cause for each effect. Furthermore its astounding arrangement and harmonious order that has no conflict or collision within it, makes it impossible that it all came about randomly. This is because that which would come into existence by chance, its development would not be ordered because all of it is random and by chance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the possibility that <strong>creation brought itself into existence</strong>, then it is also clearly impossible. This is because before its existence, creation did not exist, it was nothing; and that which is nothing cannot bring into existence that which does not exist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the third possibility that <strong>this existence came to exist without a cause</strong>, then the meaning is the same as our saying that it appeared by chance; and this, as preceded, is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It remains to be said that existence has someone who brought it into being, and He is Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. He, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators? (did they create themselves?) Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no certainty?</span> [Qur’aan, soorat at-Toor (52): 35-36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, this creation rationally proves the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>proof of the natural disposition</strong></span> for the existence of Allaah, then it is so evident that it does not require a proof. This is because man is created upon the natural disposition (Fitrah) of belief in his Rabb. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Every child is born upon the natural disposition, then his parents change him into a Jew, or a Christian, or a Majian.”</span> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why in case something suddenly befalls upon a person in this life such that it may destroy him, he would say with his tongue and without feeling: “O Allaah!” or “O Rabb!” or the like. This proves that the innate nature of man has been created upon the belief in the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof of the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Hiss</strong> (i.e What is experienced and perceived) </span>for the existence of Allaah, then it is very often that we hear of supplications being answered by Allaah. Also the person himself who calls upon Allaah, his supplications are indeed responded to. Many are those who invoked Allaah and said: “O [Yaa] Rabb,” and behold! They saw response was right before his eyes! Indeed in the Qur’aan there are many examples for this, like the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) Ayyub (Job), when he cried to his Rabb: “Verily, distress has seized me, and you are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy”. So We answered his call, and We removed the distress that was on him.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Anbiyaa’ (21): 83-84].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, there are many other examples from the Sunnah, one of which is the Hadeeth reported by Anas ibn Maalik in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A man [a bedouin Arab] entered the mosque on the day of Jum’ah whilst the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was delivering the Khutbah, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, property is being destroyed, and the passages have become blocked, so supplicate Allaah to send rain down upon us.’ The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) raised his hands and then said: ‘O Allaah send down rain upon us; O Allaah send down rain upon us.’ The sky was clear without any cloud in it. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) did not come down from his pulpit except that rain was flowing from his beard, may Allaah’s Salaat and Salaam be upon him. There was a downpour of rain for one week. Then on the succeeding Friday a man (the same man or someone else) entered the mosque and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, the houses are collapsing and wealth is being flooded, so supplicate Allaah to stop the rain for us.’ The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) raised his hands and began to say: ‘around us and not upon us,’ pointing with his hands, and he did not point to any direction except that it cleared.” [36] People then stepped out walking in the sunshine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are the supplications which a person calls upon his Rabb (Allaah) to be answered are indeed responded to. This is a proof contained in what is experienced and perceived for the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shar’ee proof for the existence of Allaah</span></strong>, then it is beyond being enumerated. Indeed the Qur’aan in its entirety as well as all of the affirmed Ahaadeeth in their legal and informative nature, proves the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, as Allaah Says concerning the Sublime Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Had it been from other than Allaah, they would have surely found therein much discrepancy.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 82].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the existence of Allaah, is one of the matters that comprise(s) the belief in Allaah. As for the belief in Allaah’s Ruboobiyyah, Uloohiyyah, Names and Attributes, then a detailed discussion of these branches of Tawheed has preceded.</p>

The One Who remains and never passes away, the One Who neither eats nor drinks, free of all needs.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>” – Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Concerning his statement: &#8220;Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clause of continuation, after He mentioned <em>Al-Ahadai&#8217;yyah</em> (the oneness), he mentioned <em>As-Samadiyyah</em>, and used a definite clause for both, to indicate exclusivity. That is Allah, alone, is <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the meaning of <em>As-Samad</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that As-Samad means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is the Perfect One, in His Knowledge, His Power, His Wisdom, His ’<em>Izzah</em> (Honor and Might), His Sovereignty and in all His Attributes</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em> As-Samad</em> is the one who does not have any cavity</strong></span> &#8211; that is without intestines nor abdomen. That is why it is said: The Angels are <em>Samad</em> because they do not have cavities; they do not eat nor drink. This meaning is related from Ibn ’Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.[1] And this does not negate the first meaning, because it indicates His self sufficiency from all of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said: <em>As-Samad</em> has the meaning of the <em>Ma’ful</em> form, that is <em>Al-Masmudu ilaihi</em>;He who is betaken to by the creation of their needs, with the meaning that they incline to Him and they reach out for Him, and surrender their needs to Him. So it has the meaning of the everyone is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These interpretations do not contradict one another in relation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and as such we say that each of these meanings are affirmed due to the lack of contradiction among them. We interpret it with a comprehensive interpretation; we say As-Samad is the One Who is Perfect in His Attributes, the One whom all His creatures are in need of; they are dependent upon Him. Therefore, the tremendous meaning of the word As-Samad becomes clear to you. He is the One independent of any need from all other than Him, Perfect in all of What is attributed to Him, and that all other than Him is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody says to you: “Allah rose above the Throne, does His rising above the Throne mean that He is in need of the Throne, such that if the Throne was removed, He would fall?” The answer is no! Never! Because Allah is <em>Samad</em>, perfect without need of the Throne. Rather the Throne, the heavens, the <em>Kursi</em> and all creatures are in need of Allah; He is independent of any need from them. We derive this from the word <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody asks: &#8220;<strong>Does Allah eat and drink</strong>?&#8221; I say: Never; because Allah is <em>Samad</em>.” With this, we recognize that the word <em>As-Samad</em> is a word that covers all the perfect Attributes of Allah, and it relates to all the imperfect attributes of the creatures. That is why the are in need of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.</p>

<p>Based upon the hadeeth qudsi ‘O My slaves’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord (may He be glorified) is that He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you, O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him finds good praise Allah and let him who finds other that blame no one but himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>bidaayat us-sool fi tafdheel ir-rasool </em>&#8211; …the superiority of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) – page no. 5-7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) says in his introduction:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, O <em>Muslim</em> brother, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this station of loving Allaah and His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] except by<em>tawheed</em> (singling out) of Allaah, the Most High, alone in His worship, and by singling out the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone for following from among the servants of Allaah, due to (Allaah’s) statement: ‘He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>)) has indeed obeyed Allaah’[1] and His statement ‘Say (O Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you.’’[2] And (the Prophet) (‘<em>alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘No, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, if <em>Moosaa</em> was alive, he would have no choice but to follow me.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: so <strong>if someone like <em>Moosaa</em>, the one who Allaah spoke to (directly), cannot follow other than the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>), then can anyone else do that?</strong> Hence, this is one of the definite evidences of the obligation of singling out the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) in following, which is one of the requirements of the<em> shahaada </em>(testimony): ‘<em>anna muhammad ar-rasoolullaah</em> (that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah)’ [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>]. Therefore, Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, in the before-mentioned <em>aayah</em>, made following him (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone to be a proof of Allaah’s love for (the follower). And there is no doubt that <strong>whoever Allaah loves, Allaah is with him in everything</strong>, as occurs in the authentic<em>hadeeth al-Qudsi</em>:[4] ‘(Allaah says), ‘My slave does not come near to me with anything more beloved to me than that which I have made obligatory upon him, and My slave continues to come near me with supererogatory deeds until I love him; and when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he grasps and his leg with which he walks.[5]And if he asks me, I will surely give him, and if he seeks refuge in Me, I will surely protect him . . .’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this divine care is only for the beloved slave of Allaah, it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take the means which will make him beloved to Allaah, namely following the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone; and just by that, he will attain special care from his Mawlaa[7], the Blessed and Most High. Don’t you see that it is not possible to know the obligatory duties and distinguish them from the supererogatory acts except by following him (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) alone? And indeed there is no doubt that the more the Muslim learns about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) and knows of his pleasant nature and virtues, the more his love for him [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] will be and the more extensive and comprehensive his following of him [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] will be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From those Mannerisms that are Obligatory with Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>136 </strong>– From Qateelah bint Seefee a woman from Juhaynah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed a monk came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘You people commit <em>Shirk</em>! You say whatever Allaah wills and whatever you will, and you say I swear by the <em>Ka’abah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Say whatever Allaah wills, <strong>then</strong>what you will, and say I swear by <strong>the Lord of the Ka’abah</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Tahawi in ‘al-Mushkil’ and al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad. Al-Albaani said its chain is <em>Saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>137</strong> – From Hudhayfah who narrates the same hadeeth: ‘Whereby the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills and what so and so wills, but rather say: whatever Allaah wills <strong>then</strong> what so and so wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood and Tahaawi  in  ‘Mushkil al-Athaar’ and Bayhaqi and Ahmad. Al-Albaani said its chain is Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rabaee bin Harash followed up Abdullah bin Yasser on the authority of Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘I saw in a dream that I met some people of the book and they said you are a blessed people if it were not that you say, whatever Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills’, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Indeed I used to dislike that for you to say whatever Allaah wills then what Muhammad wills’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ibn Majah and Ahmad, Shaykh al-Albaani said that from what is apparent the hadeeth is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>138</strong> – From at-Tufayl bin Sakhbrah the brother of Aeysha from the same mother: ‘That he saw what a sleeping person sees (dreams), it was as if he passed by a group of  the Jews.  He asked: ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are Jews.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said: ‘Indeed you are the people, if only you did not claim that Uzayr is the son of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews said: ‘And you are the people, if only you did not say: ‘Whatever Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he passed by a group of the Christians.  He asked: ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘We are Christians.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said: ‘Indeed you are the people, if only you did not claim that the Messiah is the son of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christians said: ‘And you are the people, if only you did not say: ‘Whatever Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the morning he informed those whom he informed, then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came and he informed him of what he saw in the dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked him: ‘Did you inform anyone?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> had prayed he gave them a<em>Khutbah</em>, and praised Allaah and glorified Him, then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Tufayl saw a dream, and he informed whosoever from amongst you, and indeed you used to say a statement, and shyness used to prevent me from prohibiting you from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills <strong>and</strong>what Muhammad wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>139</strong>&#8211; From Ibn Abbas who said: A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> to ask about something then he said: ‘Whatever Allaah wills and what you will.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Have you made me an equal with Allaah (in another wording: a partner)?! No, but rather, what Allaah Alone wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’, Ibn Majah, Tahawi in ‘al-Mushkil’, Bayhaqi, Ahmad, Tabrani and Albaani said its chain is Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fiqh of the Hadeeth:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: ‘In these Ahadeeth we find, that when a man says to someone else: ‘Whatever Allaah wills <strong>and</strong> what you will’ then this is regarded as <em>Shirk</em> in the <em>Sharia’</em>. This is from <em>Shirk</em> in wording, because it is presumed that the will of the slave of Allaah is that of the level of the will of the Lord – <em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em>; the reason being that there is a connection between the two wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The like of this are the statements of some of the common folk and those similar to them who claim to have knowledge: ‘I have no one except Allaah and you’, and ‘we have relied upon Allaah and you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are the statements of some of those who deliver  lectures: ‘In the name of Allaah and the country.’ Or ‘In the name of Allaah and the people.’ And there are various other similar wordings of <em>Shirk</em> which it is obligatory to stop using, and to repent from using them; in order to have correct manners with Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed many of the common folk have been negligent of this noble mannerism, likewise there are of the specific people (who claim to have knowledge) who justify their utterances such as these statements of <em>Shirk</em>.  Like calling on other than Allaah at times of hardship, and seeking help from the dead from amongst the righteous people and swearing by them and not by Allaah – <em>Ta’ala</em>, and swearing by them above Allaah<em>– Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah criticizes them for this, rather than helping the scholar to forbid the evil, they show enmity by criticizing  him, and they say: ‘Indeed the intentions of these people who call on other than Allaah is good! And actions are but by intentions, as found in the hadeeth!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are ignorant or pretend to be ignorant – to please the common folk – they claim that the intention is good, you find this amongst the previously mentioned people; and it does not make an evil action into a good action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the previously mentioned Ahadeeth is that good actions are with sincere intentions, not that actions which oppose the <em>Sharia’</em> are converted to legislated good actions due to being similar to a good action, this is something which only an ignorant biased person says!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that if a man prays towards a grave; then this would be an evil action even though he is praying; and this is due to his opposition to the Ahadeeth and the Aathaar which are mentioned about the prohibition against facing a grave for prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So would an intelligent person say: to the one who returns to face the grave – after having knowledge that the <em>Sharia’</em> has prohibited this – that his intention is good and his action is permissible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would never happen,  also those who seek deliverance and aid with other than Allaah, forgetting Allaah Ta’ala due to the circumstances in which they are in, they are in need of Allaah’s aid and help much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not intelligible that their end will be good, let alone that their action will be good, while they continue upon this evil knowingly.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albani refutes this doubt by researching the following Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aa’ishah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If the Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created you?’ say ‘Allaah.’ Then he will say: who created Allaah? So if one of you finds this situation then say: ‘I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers.’ This doubt will then leave you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad graded Hasan by Albani [saheehah 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration also in Saheehah (Hadeeth No.117), the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘The Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created this? Who created that? Who created this?Until he says who created your lord? So if this reaches you then seek refuge in Allaah and it will end.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Sunni.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wording narrated by Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The people will question one another so much that one of them will say: So Allaah created the creation, then who created Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>? So if they say this, then say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَد ٌ ,اللَّهُ الصَّمَد ُ, لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَد ْ, وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًاأَحَدٌالإخلاص: ١ – ٤</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: He is Allaah, The One. <em>Allaahus-Samad</em>, He does not beget nor was he begotten, and there is none like unto Him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood &amp; Ibn Sunni and graded Hasan by Albani.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh Albani comments by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fiqh al-Hadeeth:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These authentic Ahadeeth indicate that it is obligatory for the one Shaytan whispers to, by saying ‘who created Allaah?’, that he turns away from debating with him and responds with what wasmentioned in the previous Ahadeeth, the summary of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers. ‘He isAllaah, The One, <em>Allaahus-Samad</em>, He does not beget nor was He begotten, and there is none like unto Him.’ Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan. This (then) stops him from being carried away by the whisperings of Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I truly believe that whoever does this sincerely, out of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, these whisperings will definitely leave him and his Shaytan will be defeated due to the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Then this doubt will leave you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble prophetic teaching is more beneficial and more definitive against whisperings than intellectual debate in this issue, since it is very rare that such a debate will be beneficial. What is sad is that the majority of people are neglectful of this noble prophetic teaching! So take heed O Muslims, learn the Sunnah of your Prophet and implement it, in it is cure and honour for you.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Compilation of Tweets from the lecture, &#8220;Having Good Thoughts About Allah&#8221; by Dawud Adib (hafidhahullah) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts of Allah is an enormous act of worship and has a lofty position for those seeking to get close to Allah. It is one of the obligations of Tawheed; in fact, the Tawheed of the slave will not be correct except by having good assumptions of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good assumptions of Allah brings about praiseworthy effects and beneficial fruits in this life and the next</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu) said, “Three days before the Messenger (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) died he said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Do not allow anyone of you to die except that he is perfecting his assumptions about Allah.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Side Benefit: The ‘Ulamaa` pay close attention to those statements and actions of the Prophet (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that happen close to his death by days, weeks or months because the revelation is about to cease</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts about Allah will produce good actions; and this comes from having knowledge of Allah &#8211; one is the result of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan al-Basree (rahimahullah) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, when the believer perfects his thoughts about his Rabb, he would have perfected his actions and the faajir is the one who has corrupted his thoughts of his Lord, so his actions will also be corrupted</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Deeply reflect upon this consistent, strong connection between having good thoughts of Allah and good actions. It is based upon having good knowledge of Allah, specifically about his Lofty Names and Perfect Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know the Name of Allah, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Ghaffaar</strong></span>, then you have to perfect your thoughts about Him when you make istighfaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you deeply ponder upon His Beautiful Name, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">At-Tawwaab</span></strong> and that Allah will accept the repentance of His servants and pardon them for their offences, then it is upon you to perfect your assumptions of Him, that He will accept your repentance regardless of what your offense is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If some of the calamities of this world or pain afflicts you, even some of those diseases that are called incurable or fatal, it is upon you to perfect your assumptions about Allah, that He is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ash-Shaafee</strong></span> and there is no remedy or healing except His healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me; And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me; And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again)”</span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa` :78-81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aayaat indicate that Ibraaheem (‘alayhis salaam) had good thoughts about Allah. He did not attribute becoming sick to Allah as he attributed creation, guidance and sustenance to Him. He did not say “when Allah makes me ill” &#8211; he attributed this to himself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In your du&#8217;aa to Allah for the good things of this dunyaa and aakhirah, you must perfect your thoughts about Allah that He will answer you</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”</span> [Soorah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge) I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.”</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts about Allah is from the most tremendous blessings and greatest bounties that Allah gives to whomever He wishes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Dunyaa (rahimahullah) said in &#8220;Having Good Thoughts AboutAllah&#8221;: &#8216;Abdullah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu) said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I swear by The One Who there is none worthy of worship but Him. A believing slave has not been given anything better than having good assumptions about Allah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) said,<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “And I swear by the One Who there is nothing worthy of worship but Him, that there is no slave who perfects his assumption of Allah except that Allah will give him what he assumed and all of that good is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that whoever is more knowledgeable of Allah will be the most fearing of Him and whoever is most fearing of Him will be foremost in acts of worship and will be furthest from acts of disobedience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.” </span>[Soorah Faatir :28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, having good thoughts is constructed upon perfecting your knowledge and understanding of Allah. This produces good actions and obedience, and will be your share and portion of the People of Eemaan; this is a description of the People of Eemaan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The munaafiqoon and mushrikoon have no share regarding having good thoughts of Allah. In fact, they have bad thoughts of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of nifaaq and kufr to have bad thoughts of Allah because those who have bad thoughts of Him are those who do not believe in Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And that He may punish the Munaafiqoon, men and women, and also the Mushrikoon men and women, who think evil thoughts about Allah for them is a disgraceful torment, and the Anger of Allah is upon them, and He has cursed them and prepared Hell for them and worst indeed is that destination.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Fath :6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the scholars have said that there is no punishment mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan more severe than that for having bad thoughts about Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have bad thoughts of Allah due to their disbelief in Allah, their corrupted &#8216;Aqeedah and the deviation in their hearts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These tremendous benefits were taken from the lecture, &#8220;Having Good Thoughts of Allah&#8221; by Shaykh &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq Ibn &#8216;Abdul Muhsin al-&#8216;Abbaad(hafidhahumullah)</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al-Ma&#8217;idah surah 5© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(64. The Jews say: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221; Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends as He wills. Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa, We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(66. And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur&#8217;an), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Jews say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Hand is tied up.&#8221;) &#8220;They do not mean that Allah&#8217;s Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.) In this Ayah, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. Allah describes stinginess by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck. ) Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah&#8217;s curses be on them. `Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. We mentioned before that Finhas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!&#8221;) and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered.) What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Or have they a share in the dominion Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.) and, n</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indignity is put over them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Hands are Widely Outstretched</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills.) Allah&#8217;s favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate.) There are many other Ayat on this subject. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that `Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, &#8220;This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah&#8217;s Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers.) He also said, قُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Spend and I will spend on you.&#8217;)&#8221; This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">An Exclusive Translation for Sisters Upon Al-Istiqaamah</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Fawzan</strong> was asked on behalf of a young girl the following question: [1]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">My young daughter constantly asks me, ‘Why can’t we see Allah in this life?’ What is the best answer to give her as she is young?</span></p>
<p>The Shaykh (May Allah preserve him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say to her, ‘<em>This is because you are not able to see him [in this life]. You would burn to pieces</em>.’ It is not possible for a created being to see Allah in this life. Whereas in the Hereafter Allah gives the believer the strength and ability so he is able to see Allah. Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another place <strong>Shaykh Al-Fawzan</strong> mentions: [2]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah, all of them, reject <strong>Ar-Ru’yah</strong> (the seeing of Allah) in the Hereafter. Another group exists who say, ‘Verily Allah is seen in this life and in the Hereafter.’ This is a position that is held by some of the Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third position, and this is the true and correct stance, is that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic will be seen in the Hereafter by the people of paradise as is found in the ahadeeth that have been narrated upon the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and which have reached the level of Mutawaatir (such a great number of ahadeeth it is not possible that they have all been invented). However, in this life, then verily Allah cannot be seen because the people cannot endure and survive seeing Him, the Exalted in this life. When Moosa (peace and blessings be upon him) asked to see Allah, the Exalted, in this life, Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, “My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.” [Allāh] said, “You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.” But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, “Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.” </em></span><em>[Al-A’raaf: 143]</em></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">The solid mountain became dust due to the Greatness of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. So how can a human being withstand seeing Allah [in this life]?”</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee<br />
Translated and Arranged by: Isma&#8217;eel Alarcon [<em> Al-Asaalah</em> , Issue #4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can we make a combination between the report<strong> &#8220;with His left Hand&#8221;</strong> , mentioned in the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, in<em> Saheeh Muslim</em> and his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying:<strong> &#8220;And both His hands are right-handed?&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction between the two hadeeths that is apparent on the outset. Thus his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying:<strong> &#8220;And both His hands are right-handed&#8221;</strong> is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-</strong> <strong>Seer.&#8221;</strong></span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this description, which the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has informed us of is an affirmation of Allaah&#8217;s removal from any anthropomorphic qualities. Thus, the hand of Allaah is not like the hand of a human being – left-handed and right-handed. On the contrary,<em> both</em> His hands are right-handed, may He be far removed from any defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other point, then it is that the report:<strong> &#8220;with His left hand&#8221;</strong> is<em> shaadh</em> ,<em> [12] </em> as I have clarified in the checking of &#8220;<em> Al-Mustalahaat-ul-Arba&#8217;ah Al-Waaridah feel-Qur&#8217;aan</em> &#8221; (no. 1) of Al-Mawdoodee. What further supports this is that Abu Dawood also reported this hadeeth and (in it, he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ) said,<strong> &#8220;with His other hand&#8221;</strong> in the place of<strong> &#8220;with His left hand.&#8221;</strong> This report is in conformity with his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, other saying:<strong> &#8220;And both His hands are right-</strong> <strong>handed.&#8221;</strong> And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12 ] Translator&#8217;s Note: A<em> shaadh</em> hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by a reliable narrator, which contradicts (the report  of) a narrator that is more trustworthy than him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dharr al-Ghifārī said that the Messenger of Allāh (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The seven heavens in comparison to the Kursī is nothing but like a ring thrown in a desert, and the excellence of the ʽArsh (Throne of Allāh) over the Kursī is like the excellence of that desert over that ring.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albānī comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The hadīth comes forth as an explanation of (Allāh’s) statement, the Most High: ‘His Kursī extends over the heavens and the earth,’[1] and it is clear with regard to the existence of the Kursī being the greatest of creations after the Throne (of Allāh), and that it is an independent, physical entity and not something abstract. Therefore, there is a refutation in (this hadīth) against the one who interprets (the Kursī) to mean ‘dominion’ and ‘extent of rule,’ as mentioned in some explanations of the Qur’ān. And it was not narrated from Ibn Abbās that (the Kursī) is ‘knowledge,’ so it is not correct to attribute it to him because it is from the narration of Jaʽfar bin Abi l-Mughīra from Saʽīd bin Jubayr from (Ibn ʽAbbās). Ibn Jarīr reported it. Ibn Mandah said: ‘Ibn Abi l-Mughīra is not strong with regard to (narrating from) Ibn Jubayr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that it is not correct to describe the Kursī…as in some narrations that…four angels carry it, each angel having four faces, and their feet are upon the rock that is under the seventh earth, etc. So all of this is not correct in being attributed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and some of (these narrations) are more severe in weakness than others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note: Shaykh Al-Albānī after this however, did grade the following narration as authentic:<br />
Abu Mūsā al-Ashʽarī said: “The Kursī is the place of the two Feet and it has a groaning like that of a camel saddle.”[2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest, most excellent &#8220;and most honorable knowledge is that of Allaah, Most High, His Names, Attributes, and Actions, the knowledge of His deen and of His Messenger (Peace be upon him) with love and magnification, being pleased with it all.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ranks of people with respect to this knowledge varies to a great extent. &#8220;Some people know of Allaah by virtue of His Generosity, Bounties, and Favors, others know of Him through His Forgiveness, Clemency, and Pardoning, others through His Knowledge and Wisdom, others recognize Him by His Might and Majesty, others by His Mercy, Goodness, Kindness, and Courtesy, others by His Subduing and Sovereignty, and others by the fact that He answers their supplications, and fulfills their needs, and relieves their grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is most comprehensive in his knowledge of Allaah, knows of Him by means of His own Words. He knows a Rabb to whom belongs the Most Majestic and Perfect Attributes. Far is He removed from having anything comparable to Him or any equal; free from all kinds of defects and imperfections; qualified with every beautiful Name and every perfect Attribute; Doer of what He intends (wills); Above everything [istawaa (ascended) upon the &#8216;arsh above the seven heavens] and with everything [He encompasses everything with His Knowledge, Ability, Authority, and so forth from the meanings of His ruboobiyyah, while He is the Most High, above everything]; the One who is Able to do everything; the One Who manages the affairs of everything. He commands and forbids. He speaks the legislative (deeniyyah ) [10] and universal (kawniyyah ) [11] words. He is Greater than everything, and He is the Most Beautiful. the Most Merciful, the All-Able, the All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">[9] Ibnul Qayyim. See Ftn.6, vol. 1, pp. 291-292.</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;"> [10] Deeniyyah: Pertrains to Allaah&#8217;s sharee&#8217;ah (Commands and Prohibitions of the Islaamic Code). It is also known as al-iraadah as-shar&#8217;iyyah (Allaah&#8217;s legislative Will).</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;"> [11] Kawniyyah: Relates to Allaah&#8217;s Will in His creation. Everything He Wills is certain to pass, and everything He Wills not to pass, will never occur. None is able to escape Allaah&#8217;s universal decree.</span></p>
